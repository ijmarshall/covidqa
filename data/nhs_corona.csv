（COVID-19）的住戶的指南
更新日期 2020 年 3 月 16 日
病徵
冠狀病毒（COVID-19）最常見的病徵有：
·新的持續咳嗽和/或
·體溫過高
對於大多數人來說，冠狀病毒（COVID-19）將會引起輕度的疾病。
主要訊息
 ·如果您獨居並且有冠狀病毒（COVID-19）病徵，無論病徵輕重，請從出
現病徵之日起留在家中 7 天。（有關更多資訊，請參閲下面的結束隔離一
節）
 ·如果您與他人同住並且您或其中一個人出現冠狀病毒病徵，則所有住戶
成員都必須留在家中並且在 14 天期間不得離開屋子。為期 14 天的居家隔
離從家中第一個人生病當日開始計起。
 ·住在同一家的人們很可能會相互感染或已經被感染。留在家中 14 天將大
大減少住戶可能將病毒傳播給社區其他人的總體感染人數。
 ·對於住戶中開始出現病徵的任何人，從出現病徵之日起，他們都需要留
在家中 7 天，不論為期 14 天的隔離是在哪一天開始的。（有關更多資訊，
請參閲下面的結束隔離一節）
 ·如果可以的話，請為任何弱勢個體（例如長者和具有潛在健康狀況的
人）安排並搬到另一個安全空間，在居家隔離期間與朋友或家人住在一起
 ·如果無法為他們安排並搬到另一個安全空間，請盡可能遠離他們
 ·如果您有冠狀病毒病徵：
 ·請勿去全科醫生診所、藥房或醫院
 ·您無需聯絡 111告訴他們您目前留在家中
 ·如果您留在家中，則無需檢測冠狀病毒
 ·提前計劃並尋求其他人的幫助，以確保您可以成功留在家中，並考慮可
以為住戶中的弱勢群體做些什麼
 ·要求您的雇主、朋友和家人幫助您購買留在家中所需的日常用品
 ·經常用肥皂和水洗手至少 20秒鐘，或使用洗手液洗手

 ·如果您覺得在家中無法抵抗病徵，病情惡化或 7天后病徵沒有好轉，請
使用 NHS 111 online冠狀病毒服務。如果家中沒有互聯網，請致電 NHS
111。若發生緊急醫療狀況，請致電 999
本指南適用於
該建議旨在：
 ·病徵可能是由冠狀病毒引起並且不需要住院接受治療的人，他們必須留
在家中直到病徵好轉
 ·居住在某人出現可能由冠狀病毒引起的病徵的住戶中
可以讓您度過 14 天的活動
為與您同住的人或家人制定一個計劃
您現在要做的事情就是計劃好您以及住戶中其他人如何在這 14天適應乏味的日子，以
便能夠遵循此建議。您可以準備的一些方法包括：
 ·與您的鄰居和家人商量，並交換住戶聯絡電話
 ·為您家中的弱勢成員考慮和計劃
 ·創建一個包含鄰居、學校、雇主、藥劑師和 NHS 111的電話號碼的聯絡
人列表
 ·盡可能設置網上購物賬戶
如果我們認為自己有冠狀病毒病徵，將對我的住戶進行檢測嗎？
如果您留在家中，則無需檢測冠狀病毒
為什麼留在家中很重要
出現可能由冠狀病毒引起的病徵的人及其住戶成員留在家中非常重要。留在家
中將有助於控制該病毒傳播給朋友、廣大社區尤其是最弱勢群體。
有病徵並獨居的人應在出現病徵之日起留在家中 7天（請參閱下方的結束自我
隔離）。這將減少您將病毒傳播給他人的風險。
如果您與他人同住並且您或其中一個人出現可能是由冠狀病毒引起的病徵，則
所有住戶成員都必須留在家中並且在 14 天期間不得離開屋子（請看自主我
離）。如果可能的話，除了運動以外，您甚至不應該外出購買食物或其它必需
品。如果您外出運動，請與他人保持安全距離。為期 14 天的居家隔離從家中
第一個人生病當日開始計起。

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#ending-isolation
如果不可能的話，那麼當您離開家中購買必需品時，您應該盡力限制您的社交
接觸。
住在同一個住戶中的人們很可能會相互感染或已經被感染。留在家中 14天將
大大減少住戶可能將病毒傳播給社區其他人的總體感染人數。
留在家中可能時間很難過且令人沮喪，但是您可以做一些事情來打發時間。這
些包括：
 ·提前計劃，想一想您需要什麼才能留在家中整整 7天或 14天
 ·與您的雇主、朋友和家人商量，尋求他們的幫助，購買使您能夠成功留
在家中所需的一切
 ·想一想並計劃在此期間您將如何獲得食物和其它用品（例如藥物）
 ·要求朋友或家人送上您所需的物品或網上訂購必須品，但請確保這些物
品留在家外面，以供您領取
 ·確保您通過電話或社交媒體與朋友和家人保持聯絡
 ·想一想您在家中可以做的事情。能夠留在家中的人會好好利用一整天的
時間，例如做飯、閱讀、在線學習和看電影等活動
 ·許多人發現規劃整整 14天的日程（例如臨時日程表）會有所幫助。您也
可能會發現提前規劃好您的日程會有幫助，例如，如果住戶中有人的病徵
惡化，例如呼吸困難
 ·當您病徵好轉時，請記住做一些運動因為它對您的健康有所幫助。尋找
可以幫助您在家中進行輕運動的在線課程
留在家中時，請確保您做以下事情
留在家
您和所有的住戶成員應留在家中。請勿上班、上課或去公衆場所，也不要使用
公共交通或的士
如果可能的話，除了運動以外，您甚至不應該外出購買食物或其它必需品。如
果您外出運動，請與他人保持安全距離。為期 14天的居家隔離從家中第一個
人生病當日開始計起。
如果您需要食物雜貨、其它物品或領取藥物，或遛狗，則需尋求朋友或親戚的
協助。或者，您也可以用電話或上網訂購藥物。您也可以上網訂購物品。如果
您上網訂購物品，請確保您告訴送貨員將物品留在家外面，以供您領取。送貨
員不應入屋。
如果您是員工並且由于冠狀病毒而無法工作，請參閱 英國勞動和撫恤金部
的指南 查找有關您可用的支支援的資訊。

如果您與孩子同住
盡您所能繼續遵循此建議，但是，我們知道並非所有這些措施都是可行的。
到目前為止，我們看到的是感染冠狀病毒的兒童受到的影響似乎較小。重要的
是，請盡最大可能遵守本指南。
如果您與脆弱的人同住
盡可能減少任何弱勢家庭成員在共享空間（如廚房、浴室和客廳）中度過的時
間，並確保共享空間通風良好。
嘗試與弱勢群體的人保持 2米（3步）距離，並鼓勵他們盡可能地睡在另一張
床上。如果可以，他們應該使用單獨的浴室，不應與其他住戶成員共用同一間
浴室。確保他們使用與家中其他成員不同的毛巾，不管是洗澡后用來擦身的毛
巾，還是用來擦手保持手部衛生的毛巾。
如果您確實與弱勢群體共用一間廁所和浴室，那麼每次使用后都務必清潔它們
（例如，抹一下您接觸過的表面），這一點很重要。另一個提示是考慮制定輪
流洗澡計劃，讓弱勢人群先使用該設施。
如果您與弱勢群體共用一間廚房，請避免在他們在場時使用。
如果可以的話，他們應該把飯菜帶回房間吃。（如果有）請使用洗碗機清洗和
烘乾家人使用過的餐具。（如果沒有）請使用您常使用的洗潔精和溫水清洗並
徹底烘乾使用過的餐具。如果弱視群體的人正在使用自己的餐具，請記住使用
單獨的茶巾將他們的餐具抹乾。
我們知道，對於某些人而言，留在家中並無法與其他人交流會很難受。您應盡
最大努力遵守本指南，並且住戶中的每個人都應經常洗手，避免觸摸臉部並清
潔經常觸摸的表面。
如果您在感染時喂母奶
目前尚無證據表明該病毒可通過母乳傳播。病毒可以通過與您密切接觸的任何
人的相同方式傳播給嬰兒。目前的證據表明，感染冠狀病毒的兒童的病徵比成
年人少得多。母乳喂養的好處超過通過母乳或密切接觸傳播病毒的任何潛在風
險；但是，您可以做出個人決定，是否要通過電話與您的助產士、家訪護士或
全科醫生進行討論。
如果您或您的家人正在餵配方奶或速溶牛奶，則在每次使用前應仔細對嬰兒用
品進行滅菌。請勿與他人共用奶瓶或吸奶器。
您可以在皇家婦產科醫師學院網站上找到更多資訊。
廢物的清理和處置
清理時，應使用您常使用的家用產品，例如清潔劑和漂白劑，因為它們對於清
除表面的病毒非常有效。清潔經常觸摸的表面，例如門把手、扶手、遙控器和
桌面。如果家中有年長或脆弱的人，這一點尤其重要。
可以將個人廢物（例如用過的紙巾）和一次性清潔布安全地存儲在一次性垃圾
袋中。這些袋子應放在另一個袋子中，綁緊並與其它廢物分開存放。在放置到
常用的外部家居廢物箱之前，應將其放置至少 72小時。
其他家居廢物可以照常處置。
洗衣房
為了最大程度地減少空氣中傳播病毒的可能性，請勿搖動髒衣服。
按照製造商的指示適當清洗衣物。所有髒衣服都可以在丟在同一桶内進行清
洗。
如果您家中沒有洗衣機，請在 7天（對於個人隔離）或 14天（對於居家隔
離）隔離期結束後再等待 72個小時，然後才能將衣物送至公共自助洗衣店。
您可以做些什麼來幫助自己更快痊愈
喝水以保持身體水分；您白天應該喝足夠的水，這樣您的尿（尿液）會呈淡白
色。您可以使用非處方藥（例如撲熱息痛）來緩解某些病徵。根據包裝或標籤
上的指示使用這些藥物，並且不要超過建議劑量。
如果您或您的家人需要看醫生
如果您的疾病或任何住戶成員的疾病持續惡化，請立即就醫。如果不是緊急狀
況，請通過 111.nhs.uk與 NHS 111 online聯絡。如果家中沒有互聯網，則應
致電 NHS 111。如果情況緊急並且您需要叫救護車，則應該告知電話接綫員您
或您的親戚有冠狀病毒病徵。
在您和家人留在家中期間，盡可能取消所有常規的門診和牙科預約。如果您擔
心或被要求在家隔離期間親自到診，請首先使用他們向您提供的電話號碼與您
的醫療聯絡人（例如您的全科醫生、當地醫院或門診服務）進行商討。如果您
擔心與冠狀病毒病徵有關，請聯絡 NHS 111 online。如果家中沒有互聯網，則
應致電 NHS 111。

https://111.nhs.uk/
經常洗手
每天用肥皂和水清洗至少 20秒鐘或使用洗手液經常清潔雙手。這將有助於保
護您和與您同住的人。這一步驟是減少將病毒傳播給他人的風險最有效的方法
之一。
咳嗽和打噴嚏時請遮好
咳嗽或打噴嚏時請用一次性紙巾遮好您的口鼻。請打噴嚏到肘部彎曲處，而不
是噴在手中。
如果您有照護者，則在您打噴嚏或咳嗽後，他們應使用一次性紙巾抹走任何粘
液或痰液。然後，他們應該用肥皂和水洗手。
將紙巾丟入一次性垃圾袋中，並立即用肥皂和清水洗手或使用手部消毒液洗
手。
口罩
我們不建議使用口罩作為防止病毒傳播的有效方式。口罩在諸如醫院的臨床環
境中扮演著重要的角色，但是沒有什麽證據表明在這些環境之外使用口罩會帶
來益處。
不要接待訪客
請勿邀請或允許社交訪客（例如其他朋友和家人）入屋。如果有事要與不是家
中一員的人說，則請使用電話或社交媒體。
如果您或家庭成員接受基本的居家照護，則照護者應繼續探視。照護者將獲得
口罩和手套，以減少病毒傳播的風險。
如果在家中有寵物
目前，沒有證據表明伴生動物/寵物（如狗和貓）可以被冠狀病毒感染。
留在家中照顧您的健康
我們知道，對於某些人來說，長時間留在家中會很難受，令人沮喪和孤獨，您
或其他住戶成員可能會情緒低落。如果您家中沒有足夠的空間或花園讓您進行
一些戶外活動，則時間會更加難過。
重要的是要記住要照顧好自己的身心健康，並在需要時獲得支持。通過電話或
社交媒體與家人和朋友保持聯絡。還有一些有所幫助的支持和資訊來源，例如
Every Mind Matters website。
https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/
想一想您在家中可以做的事情。不介意留在家中的人會好好利用一整天的時
間，例如做飯、閱讀、在線學習和看電影等活動如果您病徵好轉，則可以在家
中或花園裡做輕度運動。
許多人發現如果提醒自己做這些事情如此重要對自己是很有幫助的。希望您的
家人不會出現類似流感的病徵。但是有些人會受到冠狀病毒的嚴重影響，特別
是長者和患有某些疾病的人士。留在家中，您可以保護他人的生命，並確保
NHS不會不堪重負。
結束自我隔離和家庭隔離
如果您有病徵，則可以在 7天后結束自我隔離。
為期 7天的自我隔離從您初次生病當日開始計起。
如果與他人同住，則所有健康狀況良好的住戶成員都可以在 14 天后結束家庭
隔離。為期 14 天的家庭隔離從家中第一個人生病當日開始計起。冠狀病毒的
潛伏期為 14天；14天后健康狀況良好的人不太可能感染冠狀病毒。
7 天后，如果第一個生病的人病徵好轉並且體溫不再過高，則可以恢復正常的
生活。如果在 14 天的家庭隔離期間任何其他家庭成員感到不適，則應遵循相
同的建議 - 即，在出現病徵 7 天后，如果病徵好轉並且體溫不再過高，他們
也可以恢復到正常的生活。
如果住戶成員在家庭隔離的 14 天后期（例如，在第 13 天或第 14 天）出現冠
狀病毒病徵 ，無需延長家庭隔離時間，但有新病徵的人必須留在家中 7 天
為期 14 天的家庭隔離將大大減少住戶中其他成員可能繼續將病毒傳播給其他
人的感染總人數，並且整個住戶無需重新開始為期 14 天的家庭隔離。這將為
社區帶來高度保護。進一步隔離該住戶成員幾乎沒有為社區帶來額外的保護。
在 14天的期限結束時，任何尚未康復的家庭成員都可以離開家庭隔離。
如果住戶中任何生病的人沒有任何好轉的跡象並且尚未尋求醫療建議，則應聯
絡 NHS 111 online如果家中沒有互聯網，則應致電 NHS 111。
儘管冠狀病毒感染已徹底消除，但某些人可能會有咳嗽的症狀並持續好幾周。
僅持續咳嗽並不意味著某人必須繼續自我隔離超過 7天。

sydd o bosibl wedi’u heintio â’r
coronafeirws (COVID-19)
Diweddarwyd 16 Mawrth 2020
Symptomau
Mae symptomau mwyaf cyffredin y coronafeirws (COVID-19) fel a ganlyn:
• peswch parhaus newydd a/neu
• tymheredd uchel
I’r rhan fwyaf o bobl, bydd coronafeirws (COVID-19) yn salwch ysgafn.
Prif negeseuon
• os ydych yn byw ar eich pen eich hun a’ch bod yn dioddef o symptomau’r
salwch coronafeirws (COVID-19), waeth pa mor ysgafn ydynt, arhoswch
adref am 7 diwrnod o’r diwrnod y dechreuodd eich symptomau. (Gweler

• os ydych yn byw gydag eraill ac rydych chi neu un ohonynt yn dioddef o
symptomau’r coronafeirws, yna rhaid i holl aelodau’r aelwyd aros adref a
pheidio â gadael y tŷ am 14 diwrnod. Mae’r cyfnod 14 diwrnod yn
dechrau y diwrnod yr aeth yr unigolyn cyntaf yn y tŷ yn sâl
• mae’n debygol y bydd pobl sy’n byw yn yr un aelwyd yn heintio ei gilydd
neu fod wedi’u heintio eisoes. Bydd aros adref am 14 diwrnod yn lleihau’r
maint cyffredinol o’r haint y gallai’r aelwyd ei drosglwyddo i eraill yn y
gymuned
• mae angen i unrhyw un yn yr aelwyd sy’n dechrau dangos symptomau
aros adref am 7 diwrnod o’r diwrnod y dechreuodd y symptomau, waeth

A gaiff aelodau fy aelwyd eu profi os ydym ni’n credu bod gennym
symptomau’r coronafeirws?
https://111.nhs.uk/
Nid oes angen i chi gael eich profi am goronafeirws os ydych chi’n aros adref.
Pam bod aros adref yn hollbwysig
Mae’n hynod bwysig bod unigolion sydd â symptomau a all fod yn sgil y
coronafeirws, ac aelodau eu haelwyd, yn aros adref. Bydd aros adref yn
helpu i reoli lledaeniad y feirws ymysg cyfeillion, y gymuned ehangach, a’r
rhai mwyaf bregus yn benodol.
Dylai’r rheiny sydd â symptomau ac yn byw ar eu pen eu hunain aros adref
am 7 diwrnod ar ôl i’w symptomau ddechrau (gweler terfynu hunan-ynysu
isod). Bydd hyn yn lleihau’r risg y gallech chi heintio eraill.
Os ydych chi’n byw gydag eraill ac rydych chi neu un ohonyn nhw yn profi
symptomau a all fod wedi’u hachosi gan y coronafeirws, yna rhaid i aelodau’r
aelwyd aros adref a pheidio â gadael y tŷ am 14 diwrnod (gweler terfynu
hunan-ynysu isod). Os yn bosibl, ni ddylech fynd allan i brynu bwyd neu
hanfodion eraill hyd yn oed, heblaw am wneud ymarfer corff a hynny ar
bellter diogel oddi wrth eraill. Mae’r cyfnod 14 diwrnod yn dechrau y diwrnod
yr aeth yr unigolyn cyntaf yn eich tŷ yn sâl.
Os nad yw’n bosibl, yna dylech, hyd eithaf eich gallu, gyfyngu ar eich cyswllt
cymdeithasol pan fyddwch yn gadael y tŷ i gasglu nwyddau.
Mae’n debygol y bydd pobl sy’n byw yn yr un tŷ yn heintio ei gilydd neu fod
wedi’u heintio eisoes. Bydd aros adref am 14 diwrnod yn lleihau’r maint
cyffredinol o’r haint y gallai’r aelwyd ei drosglwyddo i eraill yn y gymuned.
Gall aros adref fod yn anodd a rhwystredig, ond mae pethau y gallwch chi eu
gwneud i wneud pethau’n haws. Er enghraifft:
• cynlluniwch ymlaen llaw a meddyliwch am y pethau y bydd eu hangen
arnoch er mwyn gallu aros adref am y cyfnod llawn o 7 neu 14 diwrnod
• siaradwch â’ch cyflogwr, cyfeillion a theulu i ofyn am eu cymorth i gael
mynediad at y pethau y bydd eu hangen arnoch i sicrhau eich bod yn
llwyddo i aros adref
• meddyliwch am sut gallwch gael mynediad at fwyd a nwyddau eraill,
megis meddyginiaethau, y byddwch eu hangen yn ystod y cyfnod hwn, a
chynlluniwch ar gyfer hynny
• gofynnwch i gyfeillion neu deulu ddod â phopeth sydd ei angen arnoch

• meddyliwch am bethau y gallwch eu gwneud yn ystod eich cyfnod adref.
Mae pobl sydd wedi llwyddo i gwblhau cyfnod adref wedi cadw eu hunain
yn brysur drwy wneud gweithgareddau megis coginio, darllen, dysgu ar-
lein a gwylio ffilmiau
• mae nifer o bobl yn ei chael hi’n ddefnyddiol cynllunio’r 14 diwrnod, megis
ar galendr dros dro. Efallai y cewch hi’n ddefnyddiol cynllunio ymlaen llaw
y camau gweithredu petai, er enghraifft, rhywun yn yr aelwyd yn teimlo’n
waeth, megis yn cael anawsterau anadlu
• pan fyddwch yn teimlo’n well, cofiwch y gall ymarfer corff wneud daioni
i’ch lles. Edrychwch am ddosbarthiadau neu gyrsiau ar-lein a all eich
helpu chi i wneud ymarfer corff ysgafn yn eich cartref
Pan rydych chi’n aros adref, sicrhewch eich bod yn gwneud y canlynol
Aros adref
Dylech chi, a holl aelodau’r aelwyd, aros adref. Peidiwch â mynd i’r gwaith,
ysgol, neu fannau cyhoeddus, a pheidiwch â defnyddio trafnidiaeth
gyhoeddus neu dacsis.
Os yn bosibl, ni ddylech fynd allan i brynu bwyd neu hanfodion eraill hyd yn
oed, heblaw am wneud ymarfer corff a hynny ar bellter diogel oddi wrth eraill.
Mae’r cyfnod 14 diwrnod yn dechrau y diwrnod yr aeth yr unigolyn cyntaf yn
eich tŷ yn sâl.
Os oes angen cymorth arnoch gyda phrynu bwyd, nwyddau eraill neu gasglu
meddyginiaeth, neu gerdded ci, bydd angen i chi ofyn i gyfeillion neu
berthnasau. Fel arall, gallwch archebu meddyginiaeth dros y ffôn neu ar-lein.
Yn ogystal, gallwch archebu eich siopa ar-lein. Os ydych yn archebu ar-lein,
sicrhewch eich bod yn dweud wrth yrwyr danfoniadau am adael eitemau y tu
allan er mwyn i chi eu casglu. Ni ddylai’r gyrrwr sy’n danfon ddod i mewn i’ch
tŷ.
Os ydych yn weithiwr ac yn methu gweithio oherwydd y coronafeirws,
cyfeiriwch at y canllaw hwn gan yr Adran Waith a Phensiynau i gael gwybod
am y gefnogaeth sydd ar gael i chi.
Os ydych yn byw gyda phlant
Parhewch i ddilyn y cyngor hwn hyd eithaf eich gallu, fodd bynnag, rydym yn
ymwybodol na fydd yr holl fesurau hyn yn bosibl.
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-employees
Hyd yn hyn, ymddengys bod plant sydd â choronafeirws yn cael eu heffeithio
yn llai difrifol. Wedi dweud hynny, mae’n bwysig gwneud eich gorau i ddilyn y
canllaw hwn.
Os oes gennych unigolyn bregus yn byw gyda chi
Cyfyngwch gymaint â phosibl yr amser mae unrhyw aelod bregus o’r teulu’n
ei dreulio mewn mannau a rennir, megis ceginau, ystafelloedd ymolchi a
mannau eistedd, a sicrhewch fod cyflenwad da o awyr iach yn y mannau a
rennir.
Anelwch at gadw 2 fetr (3 cham) i ffwrdd rhag unrhyw bobl fregus rydych
chi’n byw gyda nhw a’u hannog nhw i gysgu mewn gwely gwahanol, lle
bynnag bo’n bosibl. Os yw hynny’n bosibl, dylent ddefnyddio ystafell ymolchi
wahanol i weddill aelodau’r aelwyd. Sicrhewch eu bod yn defnyddio tyweli
gwahanol i bobl eraill yn eich tŷ, ar gyfer sychu eu hunain ar ôl bod yn y
baddon neu’r gawod ac at ddibenion hylendid dwylo.
Os ydych yn rhannu toiled ac ystafell ymolchi gydag unigolyn bregus, mae’n
bwysig eich bod yn eu glanhau bob tro ar ôl eu defnyddio (er enghraifft,
sychu’r arwynebau yr ydych wedi cyffwrdd ynddynt). Awgrym arall yw
ystyried cynllunio trefn benodol ar gyfer mynd i’r baddon, gyda’r unigolyn
bregus yn cael defnyddio’r cyfleusterau yn gyntaf.
Os ydych chi’n rhannu cegin gydag unigolyn bregus, osgowch ei defnyddio
pan fydd yr unigolyn hwnnw yn bresennol.
Os yn bosibl, dylai unigolion bregus fynd â’u prydau bwyd i’w hystafelloedd
i’w bwyta. Os oes gennych beiriant golchi llestri, manteisiwch arno i lanhau a
sychu’r llestri a’r cyllyll a ffyrc a ddefnyddir gan y teulu. Os nad yw hynny’n
bosibl, golchwch nhw gyda’ch hylif golchi llestri arferol a dŵr cynnes a’u
sychu’n dda. Os yw unigolyn bregus yn defnyddio ei offer ei hun, cofiwch
ddefnyddio tywel sychu gwahanol i sychu’r rhain.
Deallwn y bydd yn anodd i rai pobl arwahanu eu hunain rhag eraill yn y
cartref. Dylech wneud eich gorau glas i ddilyn y canllaw hwn a dylai pawb yn
eich aelwyd olchi eu dwylo yn rheolaidd, osgoi cyffwrdd eu hwynebau, a
glanhau yn rheolaidd arwynebau sy’n cael eu cyffwrdd yn aml.
Os ydych yn bwydo o’r fron tra eich bod wedi’ch heintio
Ar hyn o bryd, nid oes tystiolaeth i awgrymu y gellir trosglwyddo’r feirws drwy
laeth y fron. Gall y baban gael ei heintio yn yr un ffordd ag unrhyw un sydd
mewn cyswllt agos â chi. Y dystiolaeth gyfredol yw bod plant sydd â’r
coronafeirws yn profi symptomau llai difrifol o lawer nag oedolion. Mae
manteision bwydo o’r fron yn gorbwyso unrhyw risgiau posibl o drosglwyddo’r
feirws drwy laeth o’r fron neu drwy fod mewn cyswllt agos; fodd bynnag, eich
penderfyniad chi yw hwn a gallwch drafod gyda’ch bydwraig, ymwelydd
iechyd neu feddyg teulu dros y ffôn.
Os ydych chi neu aelod o’ch teulu yn bwydo gyda llaeth fformwla neu laeth
wedi’i dynnu o’r fron, dylech sterileiddio’r offer yn ofalus bob tro cyn eu
defnyddio. Ni ddylech rannu poteli neu bwmp bron gydag unrhyw un.
Mae rhagor o wybodaeth ar wefan y Coleg Brenhinol yr Obstetryddion a
Gynaecolegwyr.
Glanhau a chael gwared ar wastraff
Wrth lanhau, dylech ddefnyddio cynnyrch arferol eich aelwyd, megis
glanedyddion a chanyddion, gan y bydd y rhain yn hynod effeithiol i gael
gwared ar y feirws ar arwynebau. Glanhewch arwynebau sy’n cael eu
cyffwrdd yn aml, megis handlenni drysau, canllawiau, rheolwyr o bell a
byrddau. Mae hyn yn arbennig o bwysig os oes gennych unigolyn hŷn neu
fregus yn y tŷ.
Gellir storio gwastraff personol (megis hancesi papur wedi’u defnyddio) a
llieiniau glanhau tafladwy yn ddiogel mewn bagiau gwastraff tafladwy. Dylid
rhoi’r bagiau hyn mewn bag arall, ei glymu’n ddiogel a’i gadw ar wahân i
wastraff arall. Dylech gadw hwn i un ochr am o leiaf 72 awr cyn ei roi yn eich
bin gwastraff allan arferol.
Gellir cael gwared ar wastraff arall yr aelwyd yn ôl yr arfer.
Golchi Dillad
I leihau’r posibilrwydd o wasgaru’r feirws drwy’r aer, peidiwch ag ysgwyd
dillad budur.
Golchwch eitemau fel sy’n briodol yn unol â chyfarwyddiadau’r gwneuthurwr.
Cewch olchi’r holl ddillad budr yn yr un llwyth.
Os nad oes gennych beiriant golchi dillad, disgwyliwch 72 awr arall ar ôl i’ch
cyfnod ynysu o 7 diwrnod (ar gyfer ynysu unigol) neu 14 diwrnod (ar gyfer
aelwydydd) ddod i ben, yna gallwch fynd â’ch dillad budr i olchdy cyhoeddus.

https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/
Yfwch ddŵr i hydradu eich hun; dylech yfed digon yn ystod y dydd fel bod
eich wrin yn lliw clir golau. Gallwch ddefnyddio meddyginiaethau dros y
cownter, megis parasetamol, i helpu gyda rhai o’ch symptomau. Defnyddiwch
y rhain yn unol â’r cyfarwyddiadau ar y paced neu’r label a pheidiwch â
chymryd dim mwy na’r dos argymelledig.
Os oes angen i chi neu eich teulu geisio cyngor meddygol
Ceisiwch sylw meddygol yn syth os yw eich salwch neu salwch unrhyw
aelodau’r aelwyd yn gwaethygu. Os nad yw’n achos o argyfwng, cysylltwch â
111 y GIG ar-lein ar 111.nhs.uk. Os nad oes gennych fynediad at y
rhyngrwyd, dylech ffonio 111 y GIG. Os yw’n achos o argyfwng ac mae
angen i chi ffonio am ambiwlans, ffoniwch 999 a rhowch wybod i weithredwr
yr alwad bod gennych chi neu’ch perthynas symptomau’r coronafeirws.
Fel arfer, dylech ganslo bob apwyntiad meddygol a deintyddol arferol tra’r
ydych chi a’ch teulu yn aros adref. Os ydych yn poeni neu os gofynnir i chi
fynychu yn bersonol yn ystod eich cyfnod hunan-ynysu, trafodwch hyn
gyda’ch cyswllt meddygol yn gyntaf (er enghraifft, eich meddyg teulu, ysbyty
lleol neu wasanaeth cleifion allanol), gan ddefnyddio’r rhif a ddarparwyd i chi.
Os yw eich pryderon yn gysylltiedig â’ch symptomau o’r coronafeirws,
cysylltwch â 111 y GIG ar-lein. Os nad oes gennych fynediad at y rhyngrwyd,
dylech ffonio 111 y GIG.
Golchwch eich dwylo yn aml
Golchwch eich dwylo yn aml bob dydd gan ddefnyddio sebon a dŵr am 20
eiliad, neu defnyddiwch gel llaw. Bydd hyn yn helpu i’ch diogelu chi a’r rheiny
sy’n byw gyda chi. Y cam hwn yw un o’r ffyrdd mwyaf effeithiol o leihau’r risg
o drosglwyddo’r haint i eraill.
Gorchuddiwch eich wyneb wrth besychu a thisian
Gorchuddiwch eich ceg a’ch trwyn gyda hancesi papur tafladwy pan fyddwch
yn pesychu neu disian. Os nad oes gennych hances bapur i’ch llaw, rhowch
eich wyneb ym mhlyg eich penelin wrth disian, yn hytrach na thisian i’ch llaw.
Os oes gennych ofalwr, dylai ddefnyddio hancesi papur tafladwy i sychu
unrhyw fwcws neu fflem ar ôl i chi disian neu besychu. Yna, dylai olchi ei
ddwylo â sebon a dŵr.
Gallwch gael gwared ar hancesi papur mewn bag gwastraff tafladwy a golchi
eich dwylo yn syth gyda sebon a dŵr neu ddefnyddio gel llaw.
https://111.nhs.uk/
Masgiau Wyneb
Nid ydym yn argymell defnyddio masgiau wyneb fel dull effeithiol o atal yr
haint rhag lledaenu. Mae masgiau wyneb yn chwarae rôl bwysig mewn
lleoliadau clinigol, megis ysbytai, ond dim ond ychydig o dystiolaeth sy’n
dangos budd eu defnyddio y tu hwnt i’r lleoliadau hyn.
Peidiwch â chael gwesteion i’ch cartref
Peidiwch â gwahodd neu ganiatáu ymwelwyr cymdeithasol i’ch cartref, megis
cyfeillion neu aelodau eraill o’r teulu. Os hoffech siarad â rhywun nad ydyw’n
aelod o’ch aelwyd, defnyddiwch y ffôn neu gyfrwng cymdeithasol.
Os ydych chi neu aelod o’r teulu yn cael gofal hanfodol yn eich cartref, yna
dylai gofalwyr barhau i ymweld. Bydd gofalwyr yn cael masgiau wyneb a
menig i leihau’r risg y gallech chi ledaenu’r haint.
Os oes gennych anifeiliaid anwes yn yr aelwyd
Ar hyn o bryd, nid oes tystiolaeth bod anifeiliaid cydymaith/anifeiliaid anwes, megis
cŵn a chathod, yn gallu cael eu heintio â’r coronafeirws.
Gwarchod eich lles wrth aros adref
Gwyddom fod aros adref am gyfnod estynedig yn gallu bod yn anodd,
rhwystredig ac unig i rai pobl ac y gallwch chi neu aelodau eraill eich aelwyd
deimlo’n isel. Gall fod yn arbennig o heriol os nad oes gennych lawer o le neu
heb fynediad i ardd.
Mae’n bwysig cofio gwarchod eich meddwl yn ogystal â’ch corff, a cheisio
cefnogaeth os oes ei hangen arnoch. Cadwch mewn cysylltiad â theulu a
chyfeillion dros y ffôn neu ar gyfryngau cymdeithasol. Yn ogystal, mae
ffynonellau cefnogaeth a gwybodaeth a all helpu, megis gwefan Every Mind
Matters.
Meddyliwch am bethau y gallwch eu gwneud yn ystod eich cyfnod adref. Bu
pobl na chafodd hi’n anodd cwblhau cyfnod adref am wythnos yn cadw eu
hunain yn brysur drwy wneud gweithgareddau megis coginio, darllen, dysgu
ar-lein a gwylio ffilmiau. Os ydych yn teimlo’n ddigon da, gallwch gymryd rhan
mewn ymarfer corff ysgafn yn eich cartref neu ardd.
Mae llawer o bobl yn ei chael hi’n ddefnyddiol atgoffa eu hunain bod yr hyn
maent yn ei wneud yn hynod bwysig. Gyda gobaith, ni fydd unrhyw aelod
o’ch teulu yn dioddef o fwy na symptomau’r ffliw. Fodd bynnag, caiff rhai pobl
eu heffeithio’n ddifrifol gan y coronafeirws, yn arbennig yr henoed a’r rheiny
https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/
https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/
sydd â chyflyrau meddygol penodol. Drwy aros adref, rydych yn diogelu
bywydau eraill, yn ogystal â sicrhau nad yw’r GIG yn cael ei llethu.
Terfynu hunan-ynysu ac ynysu’r aelwyd
Os ydych wedi profi symptomau, cewch derfynu eich cyfnod hunan-ynysu ar
ôl 7 diwrnod.
Mae’r cyfnod 7 diwrnod yn dechrau y diwrnod cyntaf yr aethoch yn sâl
Os ydych yn byw gydag eraill, yna gall holl aelodau’r aelwyd sy’n parhau i fod
mewn iechyd da derfynu’r ynysiad aelwyd ar ôl 14 diwrnod. Mae’r cyfnod 14
diwrnod yn dechrau y diwrnod yr aeth yr unigolyn cyntaf yn y tŷ yn sâl.
Pedwar diwrnod ar ddeg yw’r cyfnod deori ar gyfer y coronafeirws; mae pobl
sy’n parhau i fod mewn iechyd da ar ôl 14 diwrnod yn annhebygol o fod yn
heintus.
Ar ôl 7 diwrnod, os yw’r unigolyn cyntaf i fynd yn sâl yn teimlo’n well ac os
nad oes ganddo dymheredd bellach, yna gall ddychwelyd i’w drefn arferol.
Os bydd unrhyw aelod arall o’r teulu yn mynd yn sâl yn ystod cyfnod ynysu’r
aelwyd o 14 diwrnod, dylai ddilyn yr un cyngor - h.y. ar ôl 7 diwrnod o’i
symptomau yn dechrau, os ydyw’n teimlo’n well ac nad oes ganddo
dymheredd uchel bellach, gall hefyd ddychwelyd i’w drefn arferol.
Petai aelod o’r aelwyd yn datblygu symptomau’r coronafeirws yn hwyr yng
nghyfnod ynysu’r aelwyd o 14 diwrnod (e.e. ar ddiwrnod 13 neu 14), nid oes
angen ymestyn y cyfnod ynysu, ond mae’n rhaid i’r unigolyn sydd â’r
symptomau newydd aros adref am 7 diwrnod.
Bydd cyfnod ynysu’r aelwyd o 14 diwrnod wedi lleihau’n sylweddol y maint
cyffredinol o’r haint y gallai gweddill yr aelwyd ei drosglwyddo, ac nid yw’n
hanfodol ailddechrau’r cyfnod ynysu o 14 diwrnod ar gyfer yr aelwyd gyfan.
Bydd hyn wedi cyflawni amddiffyniad cymunedol o lefel uchel. Byddai cyfnod
ynysu ychwanegol i aelodau’r aelwyd yn cyflawni dim ond peth amddiffyniad
cymunedol ychwanegol.
Ar ddiwedd y cyfnod ynysu o 14 diwrnod, gall unrhyw aelod o’r teulu nad yw
wedi bod yn sâl adael cyfnod ynysu’r aelwyd.
Os nad yw unigolyn sy’n sâl yn yr aelwyd wedi gwella o gwbl ac nad yw
eisoes wedi ceisio cyngor meddygol, dylid cysylltu â 111 y GIG ar-lein. Os
nad oes gennych fynediad at y rhyngrwyd yn eich cartref, dylech ffonio 111 y
GIG.
https://111.nhs.uk/
Gall y peswch barhau am sawl wythnos yn achos rhai unigolion, er bod yr
haint coronafeirws wedi clirio. Nid yw peswch parhaus yn unig yn golygu bod
rhaid i rywun barhau i hunan-ynysu am fwy na 7 diwrnod.

Dear Colleague
Covid-19 and professional standards activities (including appraisal and
revalidation)
I am writing about changes to professional standards activities in light of the latest
Government advice on managing the Covid-19 outbreak. Professional standards
activities safeguard patient safety and quality of care, support professional
development and ensure that action is taken when concerns arise.
However, in the
current situation it is entirely appropriate to free up capacity to maintain essential
care and minimise spread.
Medical Appraisal
As National Responsible Officer for NHS England and Improvement and the person
who delegates the Senior Responsible Owner function for The Medical Profession
(Responsible Officers) Regulations 2010 (amended 2013) in England I strongly
recommend that appraisals are suspended from the date of this letter until further
notice, unless there are exceptional circumstances agreed by both the appraisee
and appraiser.
This should immediately increase capacity in our workforce by
allowing appraisers to return to clinical practice.
Until reinstated, Responsible Officers (ROs) should classify appraisals which are
affected as ‘approved missed’ appraisals.
For clarity, affected appraisals will be
regarded as cancelled, not postponed.
Revalidation decisions
The GMC has now issued guidance that doctors who are due to revalidate before
the end of September 2020 will have their revalidation date deferred for one year.
This will be kept under review the GMC will make further deferrals as necessary.
This decision has been made to give doctors more time to reschedule and complete
appraisals, and to avoid the need for ROs to make revalidation recommendations
during this time.
The GMC has started making changes to its systems so that notifications about

NHS England and NHS Improvement
revalidation dates aren’t issued.
They will continue to send notifications when
doctors move on and off GMC connect lists so ROs can keep track of prescribed
connections.
Framework for Quality Assurance for Responsible Officers and Revalidation
In keeping with the need to minimise non-direct quality improvement activities, we
have decided to cancel the 2019/2020 Annual Organisation Audit, which we had
planned to launch on 6 April.
Mandatory training and other activities
Other measures to release clinical capacity and allow focus on the current priority
include amending local requirements for mandatory training and other CPD and
quality improvement activities not directly relevant to the current outbreak. I
encourage ROs to work within their organisations to make sensible changes in
these areas.
Responding to concerns about a doctor’s practice
Oversight of professional concerns must continue, but as the situation evolves, our
priority will be those concerns that are assessed as high risk.
I know that you and your teams are working hard to prepare for the challenge of the
coming weeks and months and hope that these measures will help you and your
clinicians to focus on best possible care for patients for the duration of this
outbreak.
Yours sincerely,

COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement

1. Summary
1.1 This document sets out the Hospital Discharge Service Requirements for all NHS
trusts, community interest companies and private care providers of acute, community
beds and community health services and social care staff in England, who must
adhere to this from Thursday 19th March 2020. It also sets out requirements around
discharge for health and social care commissioners (including Clinical Commissioning
Groups and local authorities).
1.2 Unless required to be in hospital (see Annex B), patients must not remain in an NHS
bed.
1.3 Based on these criteria, acute and community hospitals must discharge all patients as
soon as they are clinically safe to do so.
Transfer from the ward should happen within
one hour of that decision being made to a designated discharge area.
Discharge from
hospital should happen as soon after that as possible, normally within 2 hours.
1.4 Implementing these Service Requirements is expected to free up to at least 15,000
beds by Friday 27th March, with discharge flows maintained after that.
Acute and
community hospitals must keep a list of all those suitable for discharge and report on
the number and percentage of patients on the list who have left the hospital and the
number of delayed discharges through the daily situation report.
1.5 The current legislation does not describe a specific timeframe for carrying out NHS
CHC assessments of eligibility, or for individual requests for a review of an eligibility
decision (i.e. Local Resolution and Independent Review). Therefore, NHS CHC
assessments for individuals on the acute hospital discharge pathway and in
community settings will not be required until the end of the COVID-19 emergency
period. Planned legislative change, as part of the COVID-19 Bill, will further support
the NHS in relation to this.
1.6 The Government has agreed the NHS will fully fund the cost of new or extended out-
of-hospital health and social care support packages, referred to in this guidance. This
applies for people being discharged from hospital or would otherwise be admitted into
it, for a limited time, to enable quick and safe discharge and more generally reduce
pressure on acute services.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
4
1.7 Discharge requires teamwork across many people and organisations and the funding
and eligibility blockages that currently exist cannot remain in place during the COVID-
19 emergency period. Therefore, a discharge to assess model will be introduced
across England.
1.8 The discharge-to-assess model is based on using four clear pathways for discharging
patients as shown below
1.9 Acute hospitals will be responsible for leading on the discharge of all patients on
pathway 0, ensuring that the 50% of patients that can leave the hospital and only need
minimal support do so on time.
1.10 Providers of community health services will lead on pathways 1-3 as they will play a
lead role in assessing and providing care for patients once they are home. Community
health providers will need to set up a single coordinator in each acute centre,
accountable to a named Executive Board lead in their own organisation, to ensure
accountability for delivering the change. The co-ordination team will ensure all patients
(irrespective of their address) are discharged on time and are provided with the follow
up support as needed. The Discharge Service needs to operate at a minimum 8am-
8pm, seven days a week. This approach applies to discharges from all NHS
community and acute beds.
Figure 1: Discharge to Assess model
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
5
1.11 The discharge to assess pathways 1-3 will only be successful if NHS organisations
work hand in glove with adult social care colleagues, the care sector and the voluntary
sector.
1.12 Whilst most people will be discharged to their homes, a very small proportion will
need and benefit from short or long term residential or nursing home care. The
Discharge Service will be able to access live information from a national community
bed tracker system. The existing North of England Commissioning Support (NECS)
care home tracker will be extended to cover all care home places, all NHS community
hospital beds and hospice beds. All providers must sign up and start using the tracker
by 23 March 2020 (see Annex F).
1.13 The following sections detail what these changes mean for all health and care
sectors with a role in hospital discharge and provide clarity on the actions
organisations needs to take straightaway. This information will be supplemented by
specific action cards outlining how key roles should work differently during this period,
which will be published separately and discussed as part of webinar sessions on these
changes (see section 12).
1.14 There needs to be clear accountability and escalation mechanisms at each stage of
the discharge-to-assess process in each locality (see Annex H).
1.15 The diagram on the following page describes the discharge to asses process that
should be undertaken in acute and community hospitals and once the patient is home.
1.16 NHS England and NHS Improvement are grateful for input from The Academy of
Medical Royal Colleges and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services into
this guidance.

2. What does this mean for patients?
2.1 Patients will still receive high quality care from acute and community hospitals, but
will not be able to stay in a bed as soon as this is no longer necessary. For 95% of
patients leaving hospital this will mean that (where it is needed), the assessment
and organising of ongoing care will take place when they are in their own home.
Leaflet A, describing these COVID-19 arrangements, is provided in Annex D and
should be shared with all patients on admission to hospital.
2.2 On the day a patient is to be discharged patient, (following discussions with the
patient, their family and any other professionals involved in their care using leaflets
B1/B2 in Annex D), within one hour the ward will arrange to escort the patient to
the hospital discharge lounge, so their acute bed can be immediately used by
someone being admitted who is acutely unwell.
2.3 Within two hours of arriving in the discharge lounge, transport home, any volunteer
and voluntary sector support and immediate practical measures, such as shopping
and the heating turning on, will be organised by the discharge co-ordinators for
those who have no one else to do this.
2.4 A lead professional or multidisciplinary team, as is suitable for the level of care
needs, will visit patients at home on the day of discharge or the day after to
arrange what support is needed in the home environment and rapidly arrange for
that to be put in place. If care support is needed on the day of discharge from
hospital, this will have been arranged prior to the patient leaving the hospital site,
by a care coordinator.
2.5 For patients whose needs are too great to return to their own home (about 5% of
patients admitted to hospital) a suitable rehabilitation bed or care home will be
arranged. During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients will not be able to wait in
hospital until their first choice of care home has a vacancy. This will mean a short
spell in an alternative care home and the care coordinators will follow up to ensure
patients are able to move as soon as possible to their long term care home.
2.6 During the COVID-19 pandemic, all of the above support will be paid for by the
NHS, to ensure patients move on from their acute hospital stay as quickly as
possible.

3. What are the actions for acute care
organisations and staff?
‘Why not home, why not today?’
Acute providers need to rapidly update their processes and ways of working to deliver the
discharge-to- assess model.
3.1 Ward level:
• Clinically-led review of all patients at an early morning board round. Any
patient meeting the revised clinical criteria will be deemed suitable for
discharge
• At least twice daily review of all patients in acute beds to agree who is not
required to be in hospital, and will therefore be discharged
• Ensure professional and clinical leadership between nursing, medicine and
allied health professions for managing decisions and use prompts in the box
below:
• All patients who are not required to be in hospital and are therefore suitable
for discharge will be added to the discharge list and allocated to a discharge
pathway. Discharge home today should be the default pathway
• On decision of discharge, the patient and their family or carer, and any formal
supported housing workers should be informed and receive the relevant
leaflet (see Annex D).
➢ Does the person require the level of care that
they are receiving, or can it be provided in
another setting?
➢ What value are we adding for the person
balanced against the risks of being away from
home?
➢ What do they need next?
➢ ‘Why not home, why not today’ for those who
have not reached a point where long-term 24-
hour care is required.
➢ If not home today, then when? – Expected date
of discharge from bed.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
9
• Individuals and their families must be fully informed of the next steps
• Transfer off the ward into a discharge lounge within one hour of decision to
discharge
• Social care colleagues should be involved in daily ward reviews. This will
help with the early identification of any possible support, placement or
housing issues with discharge and allow the MDT to undertake arrangements
in good time.
3.2 Hospital Discharge Teams:
• Arrange dedicated staff to support and manage all patients on pathway 0.
This will include:
• co-ordinating with transport providers
• local voluntary sector and volunteering groups helping to ensure
patients are supported (where needed) actively for the first 48
hours after discharge
•
‘settle in’ support is provided where needed
• Train discharge staff (potentially those who no longer have to undertake CHC
assessments) to operate ‘Trusted assessments’ for patients in hospital from
care homes, so they can return to their care home promptly, and support all
care homes with these new discharge arrangements.
3.3 Hospital clinical and managerial leadership team:
• Create safe and comfortable discharge spaces for patients to be transferred
to within one hour of decision to discharge, ensuring enough space for
increased numbers of discharges.
• Maintain timely and high quality transfer of information to General Practice
and other relevant health and care professional on all patients discharged.
To create a safety-net and increase confidence in discharging,
consider:
✓ Patient initiated follow up - give patients the direct number of the
ward discharged from to call back for advice.
Do not suggest
going back to their GP or coming to A&E.
✓ Telephone the following day after discharge to check and offer
reassurance/advice.
✓ Call them back with results of investigations and any changes or
updates to a patient’s management plan
✓ Bring them back under the same team / speciality.
✓ Request community nursing follow up with a specific clinical need
✓ Request GPs to follow up in some selected cases
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
10
• Use change 9 within the High Impact Change Model (see section 12) to
ensure planning and discharge for people with no home to go to and that no-
one is discharged to the street. See Annex E for further details on
homelessness.
• Senior clinical staff to be available to support ward and discharge staff with
appropriate risk-taking and clinical advice arrangements
• Where applicable to the patient, COVID-19 test results are included in
documentation that accompanies the person on discharge
• Ensure all patients identified being in the last days or weeks of their life are
rapidly transferred to the care of community palliative care teams who will be
responsible for co-ordinating and facilitating rapid discharge to home or a
hospice.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
11
4. What are the actions for providers
of community health services?
4.1 Providers of community healthcare are expected to update their processes and ways
of working to deliver the discharge to assess model. Community health services will
take overall responsibility for ensuring the effective delivery of the discharge service
and for pathways 1,2 and 3.
As part of this they should:
• Identify an Executive Lead to oversee the implementation and delivery of the
Discharge to Assess model in the acute hospitals in their area. The model should
operate at least 8am-8pm 7 days a week
• Release staff from their current roles (see separate Community Health Service
prioritisation guidance) to co-ordinate and manage the discharge arrangements for
all patients from community and acute bedded units on pathways 1, 2 and 3
• Have an easily accessible single point of contact which will always accept
assessments from staff in the hospital and source the care requested, in
conjunction with local authorities
• Deliver enhanced occupational therapy and physiotherapy 7 days a week to
reduce the length of time a patient needs to remain in a hospital rehabilitation bed
• Use multi-disciplinary teams on the day they are home from hospital, to assess
and arrange packages of support for patients on pathways 2 and 3.
• Co-ordinate the care for patients discharged on pathways 1-3
• Ensure provision of equipment to support discharge.
• Ensure patients on all three pathways are tracked and followed up to assess for
long term needs at the end of the period of recovery
• Maintain the flow of patients from community beds including re-ablement and
rehabilitation packages in home settings, to allow the next sets of patients to be
discharged from acute care
4.2 For patients identified being in the last days or weeks of their life Community
Palliative Care teams will be responsible for co-ordinating and facilitating rapid
discharge to home or hospice. This supersedes the current fast track end of life
process
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
12
5. What are the actions for Councils
and Adult Social Care services?
5.1 As part of implementing the discharge to assess model, local authorities are asked to:
• Agree a single lead local authority or point of contact arrangement for each
hospital or Trust, ensuring each acute trust and single local coordinator for local
discharge to assess pathways has a single point to approach when coordinating
the discharge of all patients, regardless of where that person lives
• Work together and pool staffing to ensure the best use of resources and
prioritisation in relation to patients being discharged, respecting appropriate local
commissioning routes.
During this period, funding will be made available for all
patients being discharged and local authorities are enabled by the Care Act
(Section 19) to meet urgent needs where they have not completed an assessment
and regardless of the person’s ordinary residence
• Coordinate work with local and national voluntary sector organisations to provide
services and support to people requiring support around discharge from hospital
and subsequent recovery
• Take the lead contracting responsibilities for expanding the capacity in domiciliary
care, care homes and reablement services in the local area paid for from the NHS
COVID-19 budget.
5.2 Specific responsibilities for Adult Social Care
• Identify an Executive Lead for the leadership and delivery of the Discharge to
Assess model.
• Redeploy social work staff from the hospital setting to community settings to
support discharged patients. Safeguarding investigations should continue to take
place in a hospital setting if necessary.
• Ensure there are robust tracking mechanisms to track care placements so that
care users do not get lost in the system at a time of very rapid response.
• Suspend need for funding panels for hospital discharge during the level 4 incident,
with additional funding available to Local Authorities to cover any increased costs
during this period.
• Provide social care capacity to work alongside local community health services to
provide a single point of contact for hospital staff.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
13
• Support real time communication between the hospital and the single point of
contact, not just by email.
• Provide capacity to review care provision and change if necessary, at an
appropriate point.
• Work closely with community health providers over the provision of equipment.
• Ensure there is 7 day working for community social care teams (to be
commissioned by local authorities).
• Deploy adult social care staff flexibly in order to avoid an immediate bottlenecks in
arranging step down care and support in the community and at the same time
focusing on maintaining and building capacity in local systems
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
14
6. What are the actions for Clinical
Commissioning Groups?
6.1 CCGs supported by Integrated Care Systems (ICSs) or System Transformation
Partnerships (STPs) need to support the coordination of activities set out in this
framework. Specifically, they must:
• Coordinate local financial flows for NHS COVID-19 spend, including monitoring all
local spend, coordinating local funding arrangements and work in partnership with
local Government to support them in their lead contracting role in the local system.
• Comply with NHS England and NHS Improvement financial controls and reporting
as set out in Section 10.
• CCGs should follow the guidance on NHS Continuing Healthcare in line with the
detail found in Annex G.
• Free up staff resource from NHS Continuing Healthcare assessment processes to
support the discharge-to-assess activities and transfer staff to local providers to
support these new discharge arrangements.
• Arrange for community health end of life teams to take responsibility for any “fast
track patients” end of life care patients needing support and step down.
• Co-ordinate and lead the rapid implementation of the Capacity Tracker (see Annex
F) and NHS mail in care homes and hospices throughout their local area (see
Section 8.3).
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
15
7. What are the actions for the
Voluntary Sector?
Many systems already work with the voluntary sector to facilitate swift and safe
discharges. In the current situation immediate
consideration should be given to
increasing the capacity of these services
7.1 The sector should:
• mobilise quickly and focuses on safety and positive experiences for patients on the
discharge process,
enabling patients to feel supported at home. They can also
help reticent patients feel much more comfortable about being discharged
• Provide a range of practical support to facilitate rapid discharge, including
transport home and equipment such as key safes
• Support discharged patients with home settling services to maintain wellbeing in
the community (e.g. safety checks and essential food shopping)
• Provide ongoing community-based support to support emotional wellbeing, such
as wellbeing daily phone calls and companionship
• Engage with NHS providers (particularly discharge teams) to provide solutions to
operational discharge challenges, freeing-up clinical staff for other activities –
focusing on the patients on pathway 0
• Utilise embedded local voluntary organisations in discharge pathways and
enhance with input from large voluntary organisations
• Coordinate support between voluntary organisations and existing volunteers within
NHS providers.
• In advance of discharge be at the patient's home to accept equipment
• St John Ambulance can also provide assisted discharge where conveyance
by ambulance is required
7.2 Voluntary sector assisted discharge scheme extension
• Over the winter months of 2019/20, the British Red Cross Age UK and St
John Ambulance have been providing discharge support to 42 hospitals
between them. The charities provide practical and emotional support for both
inpatients and those attending A&E, then assist frail and vulnerable people
home from hospital. This service can remove practical barriers to discharge
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
16
by freeing up the time of NHS staff to focus on clinical tasks, providing
transport or escort home to resettle, and undertaking follow up safe-and-well
checks once home.
This service will now be extended to support up to 100
hospitals
7.3 NHS volunteers to support hospital discharge
In addition to the support being offered by charities as part of the response to
COVID-19, hospitals should consider how to deploy their NHS volunteers to
volunteering roles that can most reduce pressure on services.
Many hospitals
utilise volunteers to assist people in getting ready to go home from hospital,
ensuring they have everything they need and that everything is in place at
their place of residence. They can greatly speed up the discharge process
and also reduce the likelihood of readmission by ensuring that the person has
the right support and resources in place at home. Volunteers can also provide
advice and signposting to community support services and increase patient’s
confidence about leaving hospital and going home.
• 7.4 NHS England and Improvement is setting up a new scheme to identify
additional volunteers able to support the NHS led by the Royal Voluntary
Service using the GoodSAM app as the digital platform.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
17
8. What are the actions for Care
Providers?
8.1 Care Home providers:
• Maintain capacity and identify vacancies that can be used for hospital discharge
purposes
• Adopt from Monday 23rd March 2020 and implement the Capacity Tracker during
the COVID-19 outbreak to make vacancy information available to NHS and social
care colleagues in real time
• Providers of Care Homes, in partnership with their local Primary care Networks and
Community Health Provider, should consider how best to support residents, and
where already in place, embed the Enhanced Health in Care Home Framework in
line with timescales already outlined by NHSEI which have been communicated to
primary care providers.
This will ensure their residents are better supported (7 days
a week) by the NHS.
• Implement NHSmail in their care home from Monday 23rd March, to ease
communication between NHS and social care colleagues. From Monday 23rd
March 2020, faster NHSmail roll-out will be available to all care providers, to
support safe and secure transfer of information. NHSmail is accredited for sharing
patient identifiable and sensitive information, meaning it meets a set of information
security controls that offer an appropriate level of protection against loss or
inappropriate access.
To improve communication between health and social care during the COVID-19
outbreak, NHSX is speeding-up the roll-out of NHSmail and temporarily waiving the
completion of Data Security Protection Toolkit (DSPT) to allow for quicker on
boarding. This is in-line with information governance guidance for COVID-19.
These are temporary measures to improve communication during COVID-19. NHSX
is committed to enabling care providers to choose the right communication solutions
for them. Providers will be asked to give their own assurance that they are secure
and post-COVID-19, afterward NHSmail regional teams will take providers through
the full DSPT process, supporting them to accredit their secure email system or
NHSmail for sharing in future.
• Where ‘Trusted assessor relationships and arrangements are not in place with
Acute providers, rapidly work with the discharge team to implement these rules and
processes
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
18
8.2 Domiciliary care providers:
• Identify extra capacity to adult social care contract leads, that can be used for
hospital discharge purposes or follow on care from reablement services.
8.3 Patient Transport:
Patient Transport Services (PTS) are a critical resource in moving non-emergency patients
from one care setting to a more appropriate setting on another site. Demand for PTS will
increase through this period, and services will need to be more responsive.
• All PTS providers, across the NHS, independent and voluntary sector, will be
expected to provide support to enable the transfer of patients as part of the
discharge process and to support transfers and discharge as a priority in order to
maintain flow and maximise patient safety.
• Additional guidance on how PTS will be enabled to deliver through this incident,
including adjustments to KPI monitoring and reimbursement models will follow.
• Organisations should also consider alternative transport options. This could
include:
• Local Authority owned or contracted vehicles
• Volunteer cars
• Voluntary sector resources
• Taxi services
• Use of patient / relatives’ own car.
8.4 Equipment and assistive technology
The single coordinator will need to ensure there is access to sufficient equipment to
support discharge of people with reablement or rehabilitation needs at home.
As part of this, the local commissioner for NHS and Social Care Equipment must ensure:
• Local equipment services (across the NHS and local government) have a
sufficiency of supply of the more common items of equipment used to support
people with reablement or rehabilitation or longer-term care needs
• Access to such equipment can be quickly (same day where needed) and easily
facilitated seven days a week (utilising mutual aid with neighbouring areas or
redeployment of community based staff if required). This may include the
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
19
purchase of additional equipment and the recycling, cleaning and reuse of
equipment
• Providers are prepared for rapid implication of increased volumes of rehabilitation
equipment, including same day delivery requests
• The availability of equipment that can be used to reduce the need for two carers to
provide care to individuals, releasing workforce capacity
• Providers have access to adequate stocks of Personal Protective Equipment
(PPE).
• Simple approval process for more complex patients requiring hospital beds,
pressure relieving equipment and hoists. This should be through discussion and
verbal approval to order. Current senior clinician approval process and equipment
prescription matrices will be stood down
• Regular review and tracking of issued equipment to reduce over prescription of
equipment. The responsibility for review of equipment once a patient is discharged
will sit with the receiving care organisation
• Photographs supplied by family/carers/community staff including District Nurses as
an alternative to completing access and risk assessment visits for more complex
patients. If a visit is required, this will need to be arranged within 4 hours of
decision to discharge
• Discharge tracking information is used to ensure regular restocking of
buffer/satellite stores to maintain supply
• There is a comprehensive range of assistive technology items that can support
people to live safely and independently at home with next day access to support if
required. This goes significantly beyond falls pendants.
• Stock includes gas, carbon monoxide, smoke alarms including devices that
supports people who are blind and/or deaf, and temperature detectors. Movement
detectors, bed/chair occupancy detectors and flood detectors.
• There are enuresis sensors, epilepsy sensors and medication dispensers covering
a 28-day period.
• Equipment can be made available at low-cost and can be simple to fit without
hardwiring..
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement

9. Monitoring and increasing
rehabilitation capacity
9.1 After the first phase of discharging existing patients who do not meet the criteria for
being in an acute hospital, it will be essential to maintain this approach in any
rehabilitation and step down facilitates and broader care-at- home services. This will
avoid creating blockages in the community facilities/services and stop the next sets of
patients being discharged from acute care.
9.2 Pathways 1, 2 and 3:
• Of those patients discharged to short-term reablement/rehabilitation pathways
approximately 35% are likely to require long term care at home or placement in a
24-hour residential or nursing setting.
• It is essential that people on these pathways are tracked and assessed after a
period of recovery. Longer-term care or placement must be made available at the
right time to ensure that the pathways are not blocked for future patients needing
discharge from hospital.
9.3 Community Hospitals
It is vital that discharges from community hospitals are increased and delays
eradicated with the same approach and action taken in acute settings.
This
includes:
• A daily clinical review of the plan for every patient focusing on three questions
• Why not home?
• What needs to be different to make this possible at home?
• Why not today?
• The review process should explore why people require rehabilitation in a bedded
setting. It is accepted that the majority patients will be medically stable in this
setting.
• All patients should have an expected date of discharge (EDD) and be fully
involved with their discharge planning. Essential that expectations are set at the
point of transfer or admission
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
21
• The review should specifically look at whether people can be supported at home.
The default assumption will be discharge home today
• All actions from the review should be noted and aimed to be completed by the end
of the day.
9.4 Short-term placement for people who require 24-hour supervision and care
• For people who need a 24-hour care setting it is essential they are assigned a
case manager (social worker, discharge team nurse or CHC nurse) who will
review them regularly using the same questions as for community hospitals.
• Discharge should be arranged as soon as possible to their own home and
packages of support made available.
9.5 Short term rehabilitation/reablement-at-home review
• Using a professional supervision/case management model the service must
review all people on their caseloads daily. The team identifies all patients who
have been on caseloads for an extended period.
• These patients are discussed using the following questions:
o What is our current aim of support?
o Have we met this? If not, what is going to change to enable us to meet
this aim?
o Are we best placed to support this need? Is there an alternative?
o Can we safely discharge this person?
• Actions from the discussion are recorded and actions followed up daily.

10. Finance support and funding flows
10.1 The Government has agreed to fully fund the cost of new or extended out-of-
hospital health and social care support packages, referred to in this guidance, for
people being discharged from hospital or would otherwise be admitted into it for a
limited time, to enable quick and safe discharge and more generally reduce pressure
on acute services. There will be separate announcements on local government
resilience funding for social care.
10.2 This section sets out the financial support available for this care and support
capacity and enhanced discharge support services from NHS England and
Improvement; how finance support will to flow to CCGs; and how the relevant
commissioning budgets should be managed locally.
10.3 There will be a suspension of usual patient funding eligibility criteria while this
process in in place. NHSE&I will ensure there is sufficient funding to support CCGs
and their local authority partners to commission the enhanced discharge support
outlined in this guidance. CCGs are expected to ensure that an appropriate market-
rate is paid for this support. This includes liaising with their local authorities to agree an
approach to ensuring the market can sustain a rapid and significant increase in supply.
This appropriate market-rate may need to reflect that some patients and the capacity
being utilised would previously have been self-funded.
10.4 This NHSE&I funding support will commence from 19th March and will reimburse,
via CCGs, the costs of out-of-hospital care and support that arise as a result of the
approach outlined in this document (both new packages and enhancements to existing
packages), where it is provided to patients on or later than this date. Any patients
already receiving out of hospital care and support that started before this date will be
expected to be funded through usual pre-existing mechanisms and sources of funding.
10.5 This funding agreement will be kept under review. CCGs and local authority
partners will be notified by NHSE&I or DHSC when this no longer applies to new
patients.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
23
Proposed finance route from CCGs for additional
discharge support services
10.6 In order to expedite the most appropriate flow of funds and minimise administrative
burden, the following process should be followed.
10.7 Procurement and contracting rules continue to apply. Local commissioners should
agree the most appropriate route to deliver the enhanced discharge support in their
area. Additional financial support provided to CCGs and local authorities should be
pooled locally using existing statutory mechanisms. Under section 75 of the NHS Act
2006, CCGs and local authorities can enter into partnership agreements that allow for
local government to perform health related functions where this will likely lead to an
improvement in the way these functions are discharged.
10.8 Where systems decide that an enhanced supply of out of hospital care and support
services will be commissioned via the local authority, the existing section 75
agreements can be extended or amended to include these services and functions and
the local authority should commission the health and social care activity on behalf of
the system. Similarly, where a CCG is already acting as a lead commissioner for
integrated health and care, partners can agree that existing section 75 arrangements
can be varied to allow them to commission social care services.
10.9 Where CCGs and local government agree, BCF section 75 agreements can be
extended or varied for this purpose[1]. A model template for a variation to a section 75
agreement is available on the NHS England website[2].
10.10 The funding provided should be separately identified within the agreement and
monitored to ensure funding flows correctly. It should be pooled alongside existing
local authority planned expenditure on discharge support. Support provided and
agreed budgets from this funding should be recorded at individual level. Where care is
[1] The Better Care Fund Policy allocations for the CCG minimum contribution and the improved Better Care Fund have
been made public.
Although BCF plans from April 2020 will not have been formally approved, for the duration of the current outbreak of
COVID-19, systems should assume that spending from ringfenced BCF funds, particularly on existing schemes from
2019-20 and spending on activity to address demands in community health and social care, is approved and should
prioritise continuity of care, maintaining social care services and system resilience.

COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
24
most appropriately commissioned directly by NHS commissioners, this should be
placed under existing contractual arrangements with providers but invoiced separately
to ensure that enhanced discharge support funding is identifiable. This care should be
paid for from the additional funding set out in this section.
10.11 Where a patient has been admitted to secondary care and had previously been in
receipt of a funded care package (either in a care-home or in their own home) this
guidance and additional funding is intended to support the restart of such a package
also. I.e. restarted care following discharge will be counted as covered by this
additional funding.
10.12 CCGs and local authorities should work with the trusts from which patients are
being discharged, and with their community services and voluntary sector partners, to
ensure that the most appropriate enhanced discharge services are being provided and
that these align with the needs of patients that the trusts are seeing.
10.13 Commissioners should work with providers of discharge services to ensure that
extending existing contracts will be financially sustainable for those providers, and
consider mitigating actions where there is a risk that they will not be.
Reimbursement routes and cashflow
10.14 CCGs should ensure that both they and any local authorities commissioning on
their behalf reimburse their providers in a timely fashion, reflecting differing cash-flow
requirements of those providers – paying particular consideration to smaller providers.
Local authority and CCG commissioners should refer to guidance published by the
Local Government Association, ADASS and the Care Provider Alliance on social care
provider resilience during COVID-19.
10.15 NHSE&I expect ordinary financial controls to be maintained with respect to
invoicing, raising of purchase orders and authorising payments. However, CCGs
should ensure that there is not an undue administrative burden that slows down the
commencement of the enhanced discharge support services. Where necessary,
retrospective approvals and approaches to the degree of detailed financial scrutiny
appropriate to achieving this aim should be undertaken.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
25
10.16 NHSE&I will reimburse CCGs through the monthly allocation process. CCGs
should, from the commencement date, maintain a record of the costs and activity
associated with the enhanced discharge process so that they can submit a claim for
additional payment for this from NHSE&I using a centralised approach that will be
separately communicated.
10.17 Whichever model is followed CCGs should record the costs associated with this
and link in with other wider COVID-19 financial reporting requirements. CCGs should
expect to be asked for monthly updates on the costs of these services.
Enhanced discharge support – cessation process
10.18 Commissioners should plan throughout the period that the enhanced discharge
support process is running to ensure appropriate processes are in place for the period
following cessation of the enhanced discharge support process. As part of this,
planning conversations should be taking place with patients and their families about
the possibility that they will need to pay for their care later, as appropriate.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
26
11. Reporting and performance
management
11.1 Current performance standards on DTOC monthly reported delays will be
suspended from 19 March 2020.
11.2 Trusts should continue to report DTOC figures through the usual process, but will
not be performance managed on them during the period of the incident.
11.3 Providers of community rehabilitation beds must start reporting DTOC figures on a
daily basis to NHS Digital from Monday 23rd March.
11.4 NHS providers will be required to report the following during the Incident:
(1) Bed occupancy in hospitals – via daily sitrep
(2) Number of patients on daily discharge list
(3) Number and percentage of patients successfully discharged from discharge list
(4) Bed availability in community settings, via the Capacity Tracker Tool
11.5 Clinical Commissioning Groups will be required to submit the monthly financial
spend to NHS England for reimbursement.

12. Additional resources and support
Webinars
12.1 To support implementation, NHS England will be running webinars to run through
the guidance and provide local areas with the opportunity to ask questions.
This will
be supported by Frequently Asked Questions which will be regularly updated.
12.2 The webinars are for all those involved in discharge, at all levels and from all
organisations
-CCGs, local government, health and care providers, housing, voluntary
and community sector and social care providers.
The webinars will be the same
content run over four different sessions during the weeks commencing 16 March and
23 March 2020.
12.3 To register for the webinars, the web link is:
http://www.supportingdischarge.eventbrite.co.uk
12.4 Over the next few days and weeks we will also be running virtual support clinic
sessions to answer specific local queries.
Further details on these clinics will be
available on the webinars noted above.

COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
29
Annex A: The Discharge to Assess Model
This model, based on best practice, assumes that:
95% of people can go straight home on discharge:
• 50% can go home with minimal or no additional support (Pathway 0)
• 45% can go home with a short or longer-term support care package
(Pathway 1)
5% of people will require residential or nursing care setting:
• 4% require rehabilitation support (Pathway 2)
• 1% require nursing home care (Pathway 3).
Figure 1: Discharge to Assess model
There are three stages to the discharge to assess model:
Stage one
Review patients
daily and identify
patients for
discharge to leave
that day
✓ Clinically-led review of all patients at an early morning
board round, any patient meeting the revised clinical
criteria will be deemed suitable for discharge
✓ At least twice daily review of all patients in acute beds to
agree who is not required to be in hospital, and will
therefore be discharged:
✓ All patients who are not required to be in hospital and are
therefore suitable for discharge will be added to the
discharge list and allocated to a discharge pathway.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
30
✓ Discharge home should be the default pathway
✓ The discharge list will be managed by the community
provider with the lead responsibility for ensuring the
Discharge Service Requirements are met – this provider
will be the single coordinator
Stage two
The details of how
to discharge
patients
✓ On decision of discharge, the patient and their family or
carer, and any formal supported housing workers should
be informed and receive the relevant leaflet (see Annex K)
✓ Community health, social care and acute staff need to
work in full synchronisation (and include housing
professionals where necessary) to ensure patients are
discharged on time.
✓ The delineation of responsibility to coordinate and manage
the discharge arrangements are expected to be:
o Pathway 0 – acute discharge staff lead
o Pathways 1, 2 and 3 – community health staff lead
✓ On decision of discharge, all patients will be allocated a
case manager by the single coordinator
✓ All patients must be transferred to an allocated discharge
area/lounge within one hour of decision to discharge
✓ The case manager will be responsible for ensuring:
o Individuals and their families are fully informed of
the next steps
o Patient transport home is available, where needed
o ‘Settle in’ support is provided where needed
✓ Senior clinical staff should be available to support staff with
positive risk-taking and clinical advice
✓ Where applicable to the patient, COVID-19 test results are
included in documentation that accompanies the person on
discharge
Stage three
Assessment and
care planning at
home
✓ Post discharge, the single coordinator will need to
ensure the staff and infrastructure is available to
provide immediate care needs, review and assess for
longer-term care packages or end support where it is
no longer needed.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
31
✓ The single coordinator should draw on all available
local resources, including the voluntary and community
sector and social care staff no longer undertaking
assessment work in the acute units.
➢ Coordinated home assessments between health and
social care, including equipment and reablement
support, take place ideally on the same day of
discharge, led by a trusted assessor
Important considerations for all pathways:
• Duties under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 still apply during this period. If a person
is suspected to lack the relevant mental capacity to make the decisions about their
ongoing care and treatment, a capacity assessment should be carried out before
decision about their discharge is made. Where the person is assessed to lack the
relevant mental capacity and a decision needs to be made then there must be a
best interest decision made for their ongoing care in line with the usual processes. If
the proposed arrangements amount to a deprivation of liberty, Deprivation of Liberty
Safeguards in care homes arrangements and orders from the Court of Protection
for community arrangements still apply but should not delay discharge.
• For patients identified being in the last days or weeks of their life Hospital or
Community Palliative Care teams will be responsible for co-ordinating and
facilitating rapid discharge to home or Hospice. This supersedes the current fast
track end of life process.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
32
Annex B: Maintaining good decision making in acute
settings
Every patient on every general ward should be reviewed on a twice daily board round to
determine the following. If the answer to each question is ‘no’, active consideration for
discharge to a less acute setting must be made.
Requiring ITU or HDU care
Requiring oxygen therapy/ NIV
Requiring intravenous fluids
NEWS2 > 3
(clinical judgement required in patients with AF &/or chronic respiratory disease)
Diminished level of consciousness where recovery realistic
Acute functional impairment
in excess of home/community care provision
Last hours of life
Requiring intravenous medication > b.d. (including analgesia)
Undergone lower limb surgery within 48hrs
Undergone thorax-abdominal/pelvic surgery with 72 hrs
Within 24hrs of an invasive procedure
(with attendant risk of acute life threatening deterioration)
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
33
Clinical exceptions will occur but must be warranted and justified. Recording the rationale
will assist meaningful, time efficient review.
Review/challenge questions for the clinical team:
• Is the patient medically optimised? – (Don’t use ‘medically fit’ or ‘back to
baseline’).
• What management can be continued as ambulatory - e.g. heart failure treatment?
• What management can be continued outside the hospital with community / district
nurses? e.g.
IV antibiotics?
• Patients with low NEWS (0-4) scores – can they be discharged with suitable follow
up?
• If not scoring 3 on any one parameter e.g. – pulse rate greater than 130
• If their oxygen needs can be met at home.
• Stable and not needing frequent observations every 4 hours or less
• Not needing any medical / nursing care after 8pm.
• Patients waiting for results – can they come back, or can they be phoned
through?
• Repeat bloods – can they done after discharge in an alternative setting?
• Patients waiting for investigations – can they go home and come back as
out patients with the same waiting as inpatients?
Criteria- ed discharge:
• Can a nurse or allied health care professional discharge without a further review if
criteria are well written out?
• Can a junior doctor discharge without a further review if criteria are clearly
documented?
• How can we contact the consultant directly if criteria are only slightly out of range
and require clarification?

Annex C: COVID-19 Trusted Assessor guidance
12.9 This guidance is an interim supplement to CQC’s Guidance on Trusted Assessor
Agreements. It has been written to support NHS and social care providers and Trusted
Assessor schemes during the COVID-19 pandemic. It will apply until further notice.
12.10 This update seeks to further remove and reduce delays in decision-making
processes that can stop patients who are ready to be discharged from leaving NHS
acute or community beds. Shifting to this revised approach will require hospital staff,
providers and other partners to work in new and different ways.
12.11 The Government is bringing forth legislation to allow CCGs to delay assessments
for CHC until after the conclusion of the coming period, including for individuals being
discharged from hospital. This means the priority can be on timely discharges, with
eligibility assessments and funding decisions taking place afterwards.
12.12 ‘Trusted Assessor’ schemes are a national initiative designed to reduce delays
when people are ready for discharge from hospital. Providers adopt assessments
carried out by suitably qualified ‘Trusted Assessors’ working under formal, written
agreements.
12.13 Assessments and care planning can be undertaken by Trusted Assessor schemes
in a way that meets both people’s needs and legal requirements on providers.
12.14 Providers accepting trusted assessments must have access to a process by which
they can escalate concerns when a person has been discharged to their service with
needs they are unable to meet. The process must be able to respond to those
concerns promptly. Where a concern is raised about the appropriateness of the
placement, CQC will expect this to be considered promptly.
12.15 Key changes from existing arrangements:
(1) All hospitals will train additional discharge staff to operate as ‘Trusted assessors’.
Trusted Assessors will continue to support care providers with discharge
arrangements. The additional staff will supplement Trusted Assessors in existing
schemes.
(2) Most hospitals already use trusted assessor schemes for discharges to care
homes and care at home services in their areas. These should be kept up to date
in local NHS Discharge to Assess (D2A) arrangements. This should be prioritised.
(3) Over this period CQC’s priority is to continue to check that people are safe. Where
we have serious concerns, we will use inspection and other processes to do so.

(4) Registered providers and managers will need to have confidence that legal
requirements for assessments will be met, and that particular consideration will be
given to safety and infection control-related needs during this heightened period.

36
Annex D: Patient discharge choice leaflet
It is recognised that issues of patient choice and engagement can often be significant
barriers to hospital discharge where there are ongoing social care needs after discharge
(particularly if moving to a residential or nursing home). During the COVID-19 response
there will be suspension of choice protocols for this particular issue. The following leaflets
have been produced to support the communication of this message.
Leaflet A – to be shared and explained to all patients on admission to hospital
Leaflet B – to be shared and explained to all patients prior to discharge, this is split into
leaflets:
• Leaflet B1 for patients who are being discharged to their usual place of
residence
• Leaflet B2 for patients moving on to further non-acute bedded care
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
37
Annex E: Homelessness
o The requirements of the homeless and people living on the streets, also need to be
reflected in any local framework to support the Government’s COVID-19 emergency.
o Practices that have been developed in systems to support homeless persons need to
be maintained and enhanced to reflect the need to support the needs of those who are
without a home and living on the street.
It is already known that this group has a high
level of mortality, and support needs including mental ill-health and substance misuse
which may present a barrier to self-isolation.
o NHS trusts have a statutory duty under the Homelessness Reduction Act (2017) to refer
people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness to a local housing authority. This
statutory duty remains.
o To prevent homelessness from delaying discharge, the following should be followed:
• Referrals should be made at the earliest opportunity as soon as it has been
identified that a person may be homeless on discharge as this provides more
time for the housing authority and other support services to respond. The person
must give consent and can choose which authority to be referred to.
• People who are homeless also need to be able to safely self-isolate to also
prevent the need for greater care and reduce transmission risks.
• Systems should be vigilant in spotting symptoms – using organisations and staff
to spot potential COVID-19 positive persons who are homeless and have access
to rapid triage to cohort people accordingly.
• Local systems need to plan and provide for multiple venues to cohort and care
for homeless people who are COVID-19 positive, thereby still managing people in
the community where there needs to be spaces to keep people separate with
provision on the street; accommodation, water, food, sanitation.

Annex F: Community rehabilitation & hospice bed
capacity – Capacity Tracker
As part of current discharge planning there is an imperative to understand bed occupancy
and vacancies in the community. The Capacity Tracker produced and operated by NHS
North of England Commissioning Support (NECS) is to be used by all systems nationally
to record their care home, community and hospice bed capacity.
The Capacity Tracker is an established web-based tool providing the opportunity to
easily track bed capacity and vacancies to support system wide bed and discharge
planning. It has been successfully operating to support care home bed planning for
some time.
To support current discharge planning Capacity Tracker will maintain support to
organisations already registered, but will be expanded to capture bed capacity data in
all care homes, all hospices (including children’s hospices) and from all providers of
inpatient community rehabilitation and end of life care.
This is not intended to replace current information systems already being used in
some localities to track bed / room vacancies, but to run in parallel
All the above providers are required to use Capacity Tracker to report the following
vacancies and broader status information (in care homes only at this stage) to ensure
consistency of approach and availability of a real-time single source of truth across
England.
Data being collected will be:
i. Number of beds
ii. Number of bed vacancies
iii. Current status i.e. Open / Closed to Admissions (care homes only), including
number of COVID-19 residents
iv. Workforce / staffing levels (care homes only)
This essential information will be included in daily national SitRep reporting to
support capacity planning and response. It should also be used by localities to
understand their bed base and support system wide discharge planning. To support
reliable real time discharge planning when using Capacity Tracker it must be
updated as close to real time as practicable – e.g. as and when any occupancy
changes or at least once per day if there has been no change.
Accurate and timely data is essential for effective management of the response to
the COVID pandemic bot locally and nationally
System activities/requirements
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
39
There needs to be rapid system wide adoption of the Capacity Tracker. It will go live on
23rd March, with comprehensive support for registration and operation being developed.
The full support offer to enable organisations will include a call centre, online tools, and
webinars to enable users to understand what they need to input and how.
All care homes, all hospices (including children’s hospices) and all providers of
inpatient community rehabilitation and end of life care are required to be fully using
Capacity Tracker by 1st April 2020.
For current support please visit Capacity Tracker website address at:
https://carehomes.necsu.nhs.uk/.
This weblink will signpost to wider resources when they
are available to be released.
Prior to Capacity Tracker going live and to make this happen in the required timescale,
CCGs must take the responsibility to each nominate a group of System Champions (more
than one person is required to cover in the case of absence) who will oversee the rapid
implementation of Capacity Tracker in their locality. Their name(s) and email address must
be notified to NHS NECS via necsu.capacitytracker@nhs.net as soon as practicable.

Annex G: NHS Continuing Healthcare and COVID-19
Planning
NHS Continuing Healthcare as referred to throughout this document relates to individuals
aged 18 or over.
NHS Continuing Healthcare COVID-19 emergency
preparedness
Temporary Arrangements
Temporary arrangements for NHS Continuing Healthcare (NHS CHC) need to be
implemented for the duration of the COVID-19 emergency period. These arrangements
cover:
• The assessment of eligibility for NHS CHC funding;
• Individual requests for a review of an eligibility decision (i.e. Local Resolution and
Independent Review); and,
• Three- and twelve-month reviews of NHS CHC packages of care
Objectives
The objectives of implementing any temporary arrangements for NHS CHC are:
• to expedite safe discharge of patients from acute hospital beds under EPPR
arrangements.
• to reduce the NHS CHC assessment burden in and out of hospital settings; and
• to release clinical and support staff to support the system to manage the COVID-19
outbreak.
Emergency Measures to be implemented for NHS CHC during the
COVID-19 Emergency Period
• The current legislation does not describe a specific timeframe for carrying out NHS
CHC assessments of eligibility, or for individual requests for a review of an
eligibility decision (i.e. Local Resolution and Independent Review). Therefore, NHS
CHC assessments for individuals on the acute hospital discharge pathway and in
community settings will not be required until the end of the COVID-19 emergency
period. Planned legislative change, as part of the COVID-19 Bill, will further
support the NHS in relation to this.
• Individuals can still make requests for a review of an eligibility decision (i.e. Local
Resolution and Independent Review) however the time frame for a response will
be relaxed.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
41
• There is an expectation that CCGs will take a proportionate view to undertaking
three- and twelve-month reviews to ensure that the individual’s care package is
meeting their needs and to ensure that any concerns raised are addressed as
appropriate.
• Commissioning end of life services remains important therefore, and the Fast
Track pathway tool can still be used for clinical assessments or other local tools as
appropriate. However, to remove decision making delays, the responsibility to co-
ordinate the arrangements for care at home or a hospice bed should be passed to
local Community palliative care teams during this period.
• During the COVID-19 emergency period, CCGs will not be held to account on the
NHS CHC Assurance Standards nor timeframes for dealing with NHS CHC
individual requests for reviews of eligibility decisions.
• These measures set out for NHS CHC are only in place for the duration of the
COVID-19 emergency period.
• Local systems need to ensure that they have some method of monitoring actions
taken during the COVID-19 emergency measures, for example using the NHS
CHC Checklist, so that individuals are assessed correctly once business as usual
resumes.
Implications for Adopting the COVID-19 Emergency Measures for
NHS Continuing Healthcare
• If NHS CHC full assessments of eligibility are deferred, a backlog of circa 5,000
assessments per month will be created which will have future workload
implications for CCGs, NHS and Local Authority staff. The same will apply to
individual requests for a review of an eligibility decisions (i.e. Local Resolution and
Independent Review). A handling plan will need to be developed to enable the
system to ‘normalise’ following the COVID-19 emergency period;
• There may be a financial impact upon CCGs funding under discharge to assess
arrangements as part of the hospital discharge pathway for longer periods than
usual and the COVID-19 emergency money can be used for this purpose.
• Where social care has been provided free at the point of delivery for the
emergency period, the expectations of individuals in receipt of funded care
packages that may not continue to be funded after the COVID-19 emergency
period, this will need to be managed, as some individuals will need to return to
usual funding arrangements, which will mean they may have to contribute or fully
fund their care.
• Although NHS CHC is effectively a “funding stream”, the clinicians involved in NHS
CHC assessment and review are required to assess the specific needs of highly
vulnerable individuals and to commission the relevant care.
Therefore, it is still
important to ensure that care packages are commissioned that meet the needs of
these individuals.

NHS England and NHS Improvement
19 March 2020
Dear HR colleagues
I wanted to write to you to acknowledge and thank you for all the work you are doing
to support the NHS response to COVID-19. The health and wellbeing of our local
communities and all colleagues working across heath and care is at the very centre
of all of our efforts and attention. We are aware that COVID19- is now an established
significant epidemic in the UK and the NHS is under extreme pressure. This
pressure will inevitably be exacerbated by staff shortages due to sickness or caring
responsibilities. It will be a challenge for all of us.
To alleviate some of this pressure, we are working with Public Health England who
are due to publish guidance for healthcare workers imminently. In addition, we are
putting in place arrangements for NHS staff to access hotel accommodation through
a national procurement programme and for local deployment. I will forward further
details on these arrangements soon.
I recognise of course that the COVID-19 pandemic will require significant workforce
flexibility and redirection of some resources for the benefit of the patients and
colleagues working under significant pressure. It may also be necessary to depart
from established procedures in order to mitigate risks and redeploy people to the
areas requiring more support. So I would like to reassure you that we are working at
pace with NHS Employers to share some very practical guidance for all HRDs which
will support in speeding up some HR processes and fill in any gaps. The aim is to
publish this guidance this week.
I also appreciate that some of the processes national bodies have in place and
require employers to respond in the workforce space may need to be temporarily
suspended or postponed. I will therefore be asking the HR network chairs group to
advise on what would be helpful in this respect.
Increasing pressure on our healthcare system could cause significant stress and you
may have concerns about health and wellbeing of people. As you know, there is
evidence that some staff will need additional support months or even years after a
particularly traumatic or stressful event.
we are developing a national framework
where employers will be able to access psychological support for a period of time
during and after the COVID-19 virus outbreak.
The model would be evidence based
in line with the presenting condition and we would be recommending treatment in
line with NICE guidelines specific to psychological trauma. You will of course be kept
informed of further developments.
Furthermore, in recognition of the current pressures on our services, we have
deferred the publication of the full NHS People Plan, along with other national
planning priorities. However, given the evolving situation, this timeline will be kept
under review with the government.
As ever, I would like to thank you for your relentless great work and continued
energy and support, particularly throughout these very challenging times.
Best wishes

Les symptômes
Les symptômes les plus courants du coronavirus (COVID-19) sont
l'apparition récente d'une :
• toux continue et/ou
• forte fièvre
Pour la plupart des gens, le coronavirus (COVID-19) sera une maladie bénigne.
Principaux messages
• si vous vivez seul(e) et présentez des symptômes associés au
coronavirus (COVID-19), même s'ils sont légers, ne quittez pas votre
domicile pendant 7 jours à compter de l'apparition des symptômes.
(Consultez la section intitulée mettre fin à son confinement ci-dessous
pour obtenir plus d'informations)
• si vous vivez avec d'autres personnes et que vous ou l'une d'elles
présentez des symptômes associés au coronavirus, tous les membres du
foyer doivent rester à leur domicile et ne pas le quitter pendant 14 jours.
La période de 14 jours commence le jour où le premier occupant du
domicile est tombé malade
• il est probable que des personnes vivant sous le même toit se
transmettront le virus ou seront déjà infectées. Rester à votre domicile
pendant 14 jours réduira significativement le nombre total de concitoyens
que votre foyer pourrait infecter
• tout membre du foyer qui commence à présenter des symptômes doit
rester à domicile pendant 7 jours à partir de l'apparition des symptômes,
quel que soit le stade où il/elle en est de la période de confinement initiale
de 14 jours. (Consultez la section intitulée mettre fin à son confinement ci-
dessous pour obtenir plus d'informations)
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#ending-isolation
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#ending-isolation
• si possible, éloignez les individus vulnérables (comme les personnes
âgées et celles atteintes d'affections préexistantes) de votre domicile, afin
qu'ils séjournent avec des ami(e)s ou d'autres membres de la famille
pendant la période de confinement du foyer
• si vous n'êtes pas en mesure d'éloigner les personnes vulnérables de
votre domicile, tenez-vous autant que possible à distance d'eux
• si vous présentez des symptômes associés au coronavirus :
• ne vous rendez pas au cabinet médical d'un généraliste, dans une
pharmacie ou à l'hôpital
• il n'est pas nécessaire que vous contactiez le 111 pour leur signaler
que vous restez à domicile
• il n'est pas nécessaire que vous fassiez un test de dépistage du
coronavirus si vous restez à domicile
• montrez-vous prévoyant(e) et faites-vous aider d'autres personnes de
manière à pouvoir rester à domicile ; envisagez également quelles
mesures peuvent être prises pour les personnes vulnérables au sein de
votre foyer
• demandez à votre employeur, à vos ami(e)s et à votre famille de vous
aider à obtenir ce dont vous avez besoin pour rester à votre domicile
• lavez-vous régulièrement les mains pendant 20 secondes, en utilisant à
chaque fois du savon et de l'eau, ou du gel hydroalcoolique
• si vous ne vous sentez pas capable de gérer vos symptômes à domicile,
si votre état s'aggrave ou si vos symptômes ne s'améliorent pas au bout
de 7 jours, veuillez vous tourner vers le service coronavirus NHS 111 en
ligne. Si vous n'avez pas accès à Internet, appelez NHS 111. Pour les
urgences médicales, composez le 999.
Personnes concernées par ces directives
Ces conseils sont destinés aux :
• personnes présentant des symptômes qui pourraient être causés par le
coronavirus, pour lesquelles une hospitalisation n'est pas nécessaire et
qui doivent rester confinées jusqu'à leur guérison
• personnes vivant au sein d'un foyer dont un membre présente des
symptômes qui pourraient être causés par le coronavirus
Mesures pour vous aider à vous préparer dès maintenant
Établissez un plan pour votre foyer ou famille
La meilleure mesure à prendre maintenant est d'établir un plan pour déterminer
comment adapter votre routine quotidienne, ainsi que celle des autres membres de
votre foyer, afin d'être en mesure de suivre ces conseils. Afin de vous préparer, vous
pouvez notamment :
https://111.nhs.uk/
https://111.nhs.uk/
• parler à vos voisins et à votre famille, et échanger vos numéros de
téléphone et coordonnées
• tenir compte des membres de votre foyer considérés comme vulnérables
et établir un plan les concernant
• créer une liste de contacts incluant les numéros de téléphone de vos
voisins, des écoles, de votre employeur, de votre pharmacien et NHS 111
• créer des comptes d'achat en ligne si possible
Mon foyer sera-t-il testé si nous pensons présenter des symptômes associés
au coronavirus ?
Il n'est pas nécessaire que vous fassiez des tests de dépistage du coronavirus si
vous restez à domicile.
Raisons pour lesquelles il est très important de rester à votre domicile
Il est très important que les individus présentant des symptômes qui
pourraient être causés par le coronavirus et les membres de leur foyer
restent à leur domicile. Rester chez soi aidera à contrôler la transmission du
virus à des ami(e)s, au reste de la population et, particulièrement, aux plus
vulnérables.
Les personnes présentant des symptômes et vivant seules devraient rester à
leur domicile pendant 7 jours à partir de l'apparition des symptômes
(consultez mettre fin à son confinement ci-dessous). Ceci réduira le risque de
transmission à d'autres personnes.
Si vous vivez avec d'autres personnes et que vous ou l'une d'elles présentez
des symptômes associés au coronavirus, tous les membres du foyer doivent
rester à leur domicile et ne pas le quitter pendant 14 jours (consultez mettre
fin à son confinement ci-dessous). Si possible, évitez de sortir, même pour
acheter de la nourriture ou d'autres produits essentiels, sauf pour faire de
l'exercice et, dans ce cas, tenez-vous à bonne distance des autres. La
période de 14 jours commence le jour où le premier occupant de votre
domicile tombe malade.
Si ce n'est pas possible, limitez au maximum vos contacts sociaux quand
vous quittez votre domicile pour vous approvisionner.
Il est probable que des personnes vivant sous le même toit se transmettront
le virus ou seront peut-être déjà infectées. Rester à votre domicile pendant
14 jours réduira significativement le nombre total de concitoyens que votre
foyer pourrait infecter.

Rester confiné(e) peut être difficile et frustrant, mais vous pouvez prendre
des mesures pour faciliter ce processus, notamment :
• établir un plan préalable et réfléchir à ce dont vous aurez besoin pour être
en mesure de rester confiné(e) pendant toute la durée des 7 ou 14 jours
• demander à votre employeur, à vos ami(e)s et à votre famille de vous
aider à obtenir ce dont vous avez besoin pour pouvoir rester à votre
domicile
• réfléchir à la manière dont vous allez vous procurer de la nourriture et
d'autres produits, comme des médicaments, dont vous aurez besoin
pendant cette période, et établir un plan de mise en œuvre
• demander à des ami(e)s ou à votre famille de vous apporter tout ce dont
vous avez besoin, ou commander des produits en ligne, mais vous
assurer qu'ils sont déposés à l'extérieur de votre domicile où vous les
récupérerez
• vous assurer de rester en contact avec vos ami(e)s et votre famille par
téléphone et par le biais des réseaux sociaux
• réfléchir aux activités que vous pouvez faire pendant votre période de
confinement à domicile. Les personnes qui ont réussi à rester confinées
pendant toute cette période se sont tenues occupées en se livrant à des
activités comme la cuisine, la lecture, l'apprentissage en ligne ou le
visionnage de films
• établir un plan pour la totalité des 14 jours, par exemple sur un calendrier
improvisé, s'est révélé utile pour de nombreuses personnes Prévoir vos
activités à l'avance en cas, par exemple, d'aggravation significative de
l'état d'un membre de votre foyer, comme l'apparition de difficultés
respiratoires, pourrait également vous aider
• une fois que vous irez mieux, n'oubliez pas que l'exercice physique peut
contribuer à améliorer votre bien-être. Rechercher des cours ou
formations en ligne pour vous aider à faire un peu d'exercice à votre
domicile
Pendant votre période de confinement à domicile, assurez-vous de faire les
choses suivantes
Confinement à domicile
Vous et tous les membres de votre foyer devriez rester à domicile. Ne vous
rendez pas au travail, à l'école ou dans des lieux publics, et
n'empruntez pas les transports publics ou les taxis.
Si possible, évitez de sortir, même pour acheter de la nourriture ou d'autres
produits essentiels, sauf pour faire de l'exercice et, dans ce cas, tenez-vous
à bonne distance des autres. La période de 14 jours commence le jour où le
premier occupant de votre domicile tombe malade.
Si vous avez besoin d'aide pour acheter des denrées alimentaires, d'autres
produits ou pour aller chercher des médicaments ou aller promener votre
chien, sollicitez l'aide de vos ami(e)s ou des membres de votre famille. Vous
pouvez également faire vos courses ou commander des médicaments par
téléphone ou en ligne. Dans ce cas, n'oubliez pas de dire aux livreurs de
laisser les articles à l'extérieur où vous les récupérerez. Le livreur ne doit pas
entrer chez vous.
Si vous êtes employé(e) et ne pouvez pas travailler en raison du coronavirus,
veuillez vous référer à ces directives du ministère du Travail et des Retraites
(Department for Work and Pensions) pour prendre connaissance des
mesures de soutien à votre disposition.
Si vous vivez avec des enfants
Veuillez suivre ces conseils du mieux que vous pouvez. Toutefois, nous
sommes conscients qu'il ne sera pas possible d'appliquer toutes ces
mesures.
Nous avons constaté jusqu'à présent que les enfants atteints du coronavirus
semblent être affectés moins gravement. Il est néanmoins important que
vous fassiez de votre mieux pour suivre ces conseils.
Si vous vivez avec une personne vulnérable
Réduisez autant que possible le temps passé par la personne vulnérable
dans les espaces communs, comme les cuisines, les salles de bains et les
espaces de détente, et veillez à ce que les espaces communs soient bien
ventilés.
Efforcez-vous de rester à 2 mètres (3 pas) des personnes vulnérables avec
lesquelles vous vivez et encouragez-les à dormir dans un autre lit dans la
mesure du possible. Si possible, elles devraient utiliser une salle de bains
différente de celle des autres occupants de votre domicile. Assurez-vous
qu'elles n'utilisent pas les mêmes serviettes que les autres occupants de
votre domicile pour se sécher après un bain ou une douche, et après s'être
lavé les mains.
Si vous partagez des toilettes ou une salle de bains avec une personne
vulnérable, il est important de les nettoyer après chaque utilisation (par
exemple, en essuyant les surfaces que vous avez touchées). Une autre
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-employees
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-employees
astuce consiste à établir un planning d'utilisation de la salle de bains, les
personnes vulnérables y ayant accès en premier.
Si vous partagez une cuisine avec une personne vulnérable, évitez de
l'utiliser en sa présence.
Dans la mesure du possible, elles devraient emporter et manger leurs repas
dans leur chambre. Si vous en avez un, utilisez un lave-vaisselle pour laver
et sécher la vaisselle et les couverts sales de la famille. Si ce n'est pas
possible, lavez-les en utilisant votre liquide vaisselle habituel et de l'eau
chaude, puis séchez-les soigneusement. Si la personne vulnérable utilise ses
propres ustensiles, n'oubliez pas d'utiliser un torchon différent pour les
sécher.
Nous comprenons qu'il sera difficile pour certaines personnes de vivre
isolées des autres occupants de leur domicile. Vous devriez faire tout votre
possible pour suivre ces directives et tous les membres de votre foyer
devraient se laver les mains régulièrement, éviter de toucher leur visage et
nettoyer régulièrement les surfaces qu'ils ont touchées.
Si vous allaitez alors que vous êtes infectée
Actuellement, aucune donnée ne suggère que le virus peut être transmis par
le lait maternel. L'infection peut être transmise au bébé de la même manière
qu'à n'importe quelle personne en contact étroit avec vous. Les données
actuelles indiquent que les enfants atteints du coronavirus présentent des
symptômes beaucoup moins graves que les adultes. Les avantages associés
à l'allaitement surpassent les risques potentiels de transmission du virus par
le lait maternel ou un contact rapproché. Toutefois, il s'agira d'une décision
individuelle et vous pouvez en discuter avec votre sage-femme, un visiteur
de santé ou un médecin généraliste par téléphone.
Si vous ou un membre de votre famille nourrissez un bébé avec du lait
maternisé ou exprimé, vous devriez soigneusement stériliser le matériel
avant chaque utilisation. Vous ne devriez pas partager des biberons ou un
tire-lait avec un tiers.
Vous trouverez davantage d’informations sur le site du Collège royal des
obstétriciens et gynécologues (Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists).
Nettoyage et élimination des déchets
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/
Lors de votre nettoyage, vous devriez utiliser vos produits ménagers
habituels, comme des détergents et de l'eau de Javel, car ils seront très
efficaces pour éliminer le virus des surfaces. Nettoyez les surfaces touchées
fréquemment comme les poignées de porte, les rampes, les télécommandes
et les plateaux de tables. Ceci est particulièrement important si une personne
âgée ou vulnérable vit sous votre toit.
Les déchets personnels (comme les mouchoirs usagés) et les lingettes de
nettoyage jetables peuvent être éliminés en toute sécurité dans des sacs
poubelle jetables. Ces sacs devraient être placés dans un autre sac,
solidement fermés et conservés à l'écart des autres déchets. Ils devraient
être gardés à l'écart pendant au moins 72 heures avant d'être mis dans votre
conteneur extérieur habituel.
Les autres déchets ménagers peuvent être éliminés comme d'habitude.
Lessive
Afin de réduire la possibilité de disperser le virus dans l'air, ne secouez pas
votre linge sale.
Lavez les articles de manière appropriée et conformément aux instructions
fournies par le fabricant. Tout le linge sale peut être lavé dans la même
machine.
Si vous ne possédez pas de machine à laver, attendez 72 heures après la fin
de votre période de confinement de 7 jours (confinement individuel) ou de
14 jours (pour les foyers) pour pouvoir laver votre linge dans une laverie
publique.
Les mesures que vous pouvez prendre pour contribuer à votre rétablissement
Buvez de l'eau pour rester hydraté(e). Vous devriez boire assez pendant la
journée pour que votre urine (pipi) soit pâle et non trouble. Vous pouvez
utiliser des médicaments en vente libre, comme le paracétamol, pour vous
aider à combattre certains symptômes. Utilisez-les en respectant les
instructions sur l'emballage ou le dépliant, et n'excédez pas la dose
recommandée.
Si vous ou votre famille avez besoin d'un avis médical
Consultez rapidement un médecin si votre maladie ou celle d'un membre de
votre foyer s'aggrave. S'il ne s'agit pas d'une urgence, contactez NHS 111 en
ligne à l'adresse 111.nhs.uk. Si vous n'avez pas accès à Internet, vous
devriez appeler NHS 111. S'il s'agit d'une urgence et que vous avez besoin
d'appeler une ambulance, composez le 999 et informez le gestionnaire
d'appel ou l'opérateur que vous ou le membre de votre famille présentez des
symptômes associés au coronavirus.
Tous les rendez-vous médicaux et dentaires de routine devraient
normalement être annulés pendant la période où vous et votre famille restez
à domicile. Si vous êtes inquiet/inquiète ou qu'il vous a été demandé de vous
présenter en personne pendant votre période de confinement à domicile,
discutez-en au préalable avec votre contact médical (par exemple, votre
médecin généraliste, votre hôpital local ou votre service ambulatoire) en
utilisant le numéro qui vous a été fourni. Si vos inquiétudes concernent vos
symptômes associés au coronavirus, contactez NHS 111 en ligne. Si vous
n'avez pas accès à Internet, vous devriez appeler NHS 111.
Lavez-vous souvent les mains
Lavez-vous les mains fréquemment chaque jour en utilisant du savon et de
l'eau pendant 20 secondes ou en utilisant un gel hydroalcoolique. Ceci
contribuera à vous protéger, ainsi que les personnes avec lesquelles vous
vivez. Cette mesure est l'un des moyens les plus efficaces pour réduire le
risque de transmettre l'infection à d'autres.
Couvrez votre visage lorsque vous toussez et éternuez
Couvrez votre bouche et votre nez avec des mouchoirs jetables quand vous
toussez ou éternuez. Si vous n'en avez pas à portée de main, éternuez dans
le creux de votre coude, pas dans votre main.
Si vous avez un(e) soignant(e), il/elle devrait utiliser des mouchoirs jetables
pour essuyer tout mucus ou flegme quand vous avez éternué ou toussé.
Il/Elle devrait ensuite se laver les mains avec du savon et de l'eau.
Éliminez les mouchoirs dans un sac poubelle jetable et lavez-vous
immédiatement les mains avec du savon et de l'eau ou en utilisant un gel
hydroalcoolique.
Masques faciaux
Nous ne recommandons pas l'utilisation de masques faciaux comme un
moyen efficace de prévenir la propagation de l'infection. Les masques
faciaux jouent un rôle important dans des contextes cliniques, comme dans
https://111.nhs.uk/
les hôpitaux, mais très peu de preuves confirment que leur utilisation en
dehors de ces contextes présente un avantage.
Ne recevez pas de visites à domicile
N'invitez personne et n'acceptez pas de visites sociales, comme celles
d'autres ami(e)s ou membres de votre famille, à l'intérieur de votre domicile.
Si vous voulez parler à une personne qui ne vit pas avec vous, utilisez le
téléphone ou les réseaux sociaux.
Si vous ou un membre de votre famille recevez des soins essentiels à
domicile, les soignant(e)s devraient continuer les visites. Des masques
faciaux et des gants seront fournis aux soignant(e)s afin de réduire le risque
que vous leur transmettiez l'infection.
Si vous avez des animaux de compagnie à votre domicile
À l'heure actuelle, il n'est pas prouvé que les animaux de compagnie, comme les
chiens et les chats, puissent être infectés par le coronavirus.
Veiller à votre bien-être pendant votre confinement à domicile
Nous savons que rester à domicile pendant une période prolongée peut être
difficile et frustrant, que certaines personnes peuvent souffrir de solitude et
que vous ou d'autres membres de votre foyer pouvez être déprimé(e)(s).
Cela peut être particulièrement éprouvant si vous vivez dans un espace
réduit ou sans accès à un jardin.
Il est important de prendre soin de votre esprit comme de votre corps, et
d'obtenir un soutien si vous en avez besoin. Restez en contact avec votre
famille et vos ami(e)s par téléphone ou sur les réseaux sociaux. Il existe
également des sources de soutien et d'information utiles, comme le site
Internet Every Mind Matters.
Réfléchissez aux activités que vous pouvez faire pendant votre période de
confinement à domicile. Les personnes qui n'ont pas été perturbées par le
fait de rester à leur domicile pendant une semaine se sont tenues occupées
en se livrant à des activités comme la cuisine, la lecture, l'apprentissage en
ligne ou le visionnage de films. Si vous vous sentez assez bien, vous pouvez
faire un peu d'exercice chez vous ou dans votre jardin.
Pour beaucoup de personnes, il est utile de se rappeler la raison pour
laquelle ce qu'elles font est si important. Avec un peu de chance, aucun
membre de votre famille ne souffrira de symptômes plus graves que ceux
d'une grippe. Cependant, certaines personnes sont gravement affectées par
https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/
le coronavirus, particulièrement les personnes âgées et celles souffrant de
certains troubles médicaux. En restant chez vous, vous protégez la vie
d'autres personnes, tout en garantissant que le NHS ne sera pas débordé.
Mettre fin à son confinement ou à celui de son foyer
Si vous avez présenté des symptômes, vous pouvez mettre fin à votre
confinement au bout de 7 jours.
La période de 7 jours commence le jour où vous tombez malade.
Si vous vivez avec d'autres personnes, tous les membres de votre foyer non
affectés par le coronavirus peuvent mettre fin à leur confinement au bout de
14 jours. La période de 14 jours commence le jour où la première personne
tombe malade. La période d'incubation du coronavirus est de quatorze jours ;
les personnes qui ne présentent pas de symptômes au bout de 14 jours ne
sont donc probablement pas contagieuses.
Au bout de 7 jours, si la première personne à être tombée malade se sent
mieux et n'a plus de forte fièvre, elle peut reprendre ses activités habituelles.
Si un autre membre de votre famille tombe malade pendant la période de
confinement de 14 jours, il doit suivre les mêmes conseils, c'est-à-dire que
s'il se sent mieux et n'a plus une forte fièvre 7 jours après l'apparition de ses
symptômes, il peut reprendre ses activités habituelles.
Si un membre du foyer développe des symptômes associés au coronavirus
vers la fin de la période de confinement de 14 jours (par exemple, le 13e ou
14e jour), il n'est pas nécessaire de prolonger la période de confinement,
mais la personne présentant les nouveaux symptômes doit rester à
domicile pendant 7 jours.
La période de confinement de 14 jours aura significativement réduit le
nombre total de personnes que le reste du foyer pourrait infecter et il n'est
pas nécessaire d'entamer une nouvelle période de confinement de 14 jours
pour tous les membres du foyer. Cette démarche aura apporté un niveau
élevé de protection de la population. Un confinement supplémentaire des
membres de ce foyer n'apportera qu'une très faible protection
supplémentaire à la population.
À l'issue de la période de 14 jours, tout membre de la famille qui n'est pas
tombé malade peut mettre fin à son confinement.
Si une personne malade au sein du foyer n'a présenté aucun signe
d'amélioration et n'a pas encore consulté un médecin, elle devrait
contacter NHS 111 en ligne. Si votre domicile ne dispose pas d'un accès à
Internet, vous devriez appeler NHS 111.
La toux peut persister plusieurs semaines chez certaines personnes, alors
même que l'infection causée par le coronavirus a été traitée. Une toux
persistante isolée ne signifie pas qu'une personne doit continuer à s'isoler
pendant plus de 7 jours.

Coronavirus (COVID-19)
March 2020
COVID-19 is a new illness. Lots
of people call it Coronavirus.
It can affect your lungs and your
airways.
Most people who get Coronavirus
will not be very ill.
Some older people or people who
already have health problems
may become more ill.
You may feel worried about
Coronavirus. This is normal.
Talk about how you feel with
people you can trust.

We have a plan to slow down
how fast Coronavirus spreads.
There are things everyone can do
to help stop them and other
people getting Coronavirus.
1) Keep your hands clean.
Wash your hands lots of times
during the day:
use soap and water
use hand sanitiser (gel) if there is
no soap and water when you are out
make sure you wash your hands
when:
• you come home
• you visit other places
• before you touch food
Do not touch your eyes, nose
or mouth

Always cough and sneeze into
a tissue.
Then throw the tissue away
and wash your hands.
2) Be ready to stay at home
Stay at home and don’t meet up
with other people for 7 days if you
have Coronavirus symptoms.
These are:
• a new cough, and you keep
coughing or
• a high temperature
After 7 days, if you feel better, you
can start your usual routine again.
Stay at home and don’t meet up
with other people for 14 days if
you share your home with
someone who has symptoms of
Coronavirus.

3) Make a plan
Think about what you will do if you
are asked to stay at home.
If you have support from family or
paid carers you should make a
plan with them.
4) Only use health services
when it is important to do so.
If you:
• are staying at home and
start to feel much more ill
or
• have stayed at home for 7
days and still have
symptoms of Coronavirus
then:
• get advice from NHS 111
online
• if you need to speak to
someone call 111
• you should not go to a GP
surgery, pharmacy or
hospital as you could pass
Coronavirus to others
Only dial 999 or go to Accident
and Emergency if there is an
emergency.

1. Introduction
1.1 The current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which began in December
2019, presents a significant challenge for the entire world. The UK Government
and the Devolved Administrations, including the health and social care systems,
have planned extensively over the years for an event like this, and the UK is
therefore well prepared to respond in a way that offers substantial protection to the
public.
1.2 Of course, this is a new virus, and new technology and the increasing connectivity
of our world mean that our plans need to be kept up to date, to reflect that
illnesses – and news and information about them – travel much more quickly today
than even ten years ago.
1.3 Recognising the respective roles and responsibilities of the UK Government and
Devolved Administrations, this document sets out what the UK as a whole has
already done - and plans to do further - to tackle the current coronavirus outbreak,
based on our wealth of experience dealing with other infectious diseases and our
influenza pandemic preparedness work. The exact response to COVID-19 will be
tailored to the nature, scale and location of the threat in the UK, as our
understanding of this develops.
1.4 This document sets out:
• what we know about the virus and the disease it causes
• how we have planned for an infectious disease outbreak, such as the current
coronavirus outbreak
• the actions we have taken so far in response to the current coronavirus
outbreak
• what we are planning to do next, depending upon the course the current
coronavirus outbreak takes.
• the role the public can play in supporting this response, now and in the future.
5
2. What we know about the virus and the
diseases it causes
2.1 Coronaviruses are a family of viruses common across the world in animals and
humans; certain types cause illnesses in people. For example, some
coronaviruses cause the common cold; others cause diseases which are much
more severe such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), both of which often lead to pneumonia.
2.2 COVID-19 is the illness seen in people infected with a new strain of coronavirus
not previously seen in humans. On 31st December 2019, Chinese authorities
notified the World Health Organisation (WHO) of an outbreak of pneumonia in
Wuhan City, which was later classified as a new disease: COVID-19.
2.3 On 30th January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a “Public Health
Emergency of International Concern” (PHEIC).
2.4 Based on current evidence, the main symptoms of COVID-19 are a cough, a high
temperature and, in severe cases, shortness of breath.
2.5 As it is a new virus, the lack of immunity in the population (and the absence as yet
of an effective vaccine) means that COVID-19 has the potential to spread
extensively. The current data seem to show that we are all susceptible to catching
this disease, and thus it also more likely than not that the UK will be significantly
affected. Among those who become infected, some will exhibit no symptoms1.
Early data suggest that of those who develop an illness, the great majority2 will
have a mild-to-moderate, but self-limiting illness – similar to seasonal flu3.
2.6 It is, however, also clear that a minority of people who get COVID-19 will develop
complications severe enough to require hospital care4, most often pneumonia.
In
a small proportion of these, the illness may be severe enough to lead to death5.
So far the data we have suggest that the risk of severe disease and death
increases amongst elderly people and in people with underlying health risk
conditions (in the same way as for seasonal flu)6 7.
Illness is less common and
usually less severe in younger adults8.
Children can be infected9 and can have a
severe illness10, but based on current data overall illness seems rarer in people
under 20 years of age. So far, there has been no obvious sign that pregnant
women are more likely to be seriously affected11 12.
2.7 Given that the data are still emerging, we are uncertain of the impact of an
outbreak on business. In a stretching scenario, it is possible that up to one fifth of
6
employees may be absent from work during peak weeks. This may vary for
individual businesses.
2.8 We do not yet have entirely complete data on this disease. But as we learn more
about the virus, its effects and its behaviour (for example, the timing and extent of
the peak of an outbreak, its precise impact on individuals), we will be able to revise
estimates of its potential spread, severity and impact13.
We will then review, and
(where necessary) adapt this plan accordingly.
2.9 Work is in hand to contain the spread of the virus. This includes extensive
guidance provided to individuals returning from areas where there are cases being
reported, and encouraging self-isolation as the primary means to contain the
spread of the disease. Given that there is currently neither a vaccine against
COVID-19 nor any specific, proven, antiviral medication14 15, most treatment will
therefore be towards managing symptoms and providing support to patients with
complications. The majority of people with COVID-19 have recovered without the
need for any specific treatment, as is the case for the common cold or seasonal flu
- and we expect that the vast majority of cases will best be managed at home,
again as with seasonal colds and flu.

3.2 The UK is well prepared for disease outbreaks, having responded to a wide range
of infectious disease outbreaks in the recent past, and having undertaken
significant preparedness work for an influenza pandemic for well over one decade
(eg. our existing plan ‘flu plans16). Our plans have been regularly tested and
updated locally and nationally to ensure they are fit for purpose. This experience
9
provides the basis for an effective response to COVID-19, which can be tailored as
more specific information emerges about the virus.
3.3 These plans ensure the UK is equipped to deliver a coordinated multi agency
response to minimise wider societal impact that could arise from a significant
outbreak. An effective response also requires the active participation of a well-
informed public and all service providers.
3.4 Planning draws on the idea of a “reasonable worst case (RWC)” scenario. This is
not a forecast of what is most likely to happen, but will ensure we are ready to
respond to a range of scenarios.
Planning Principles
3.5 In preparing for, and responding to, a serious disease outbreak, the UK and the
Devolved Administrations aim to:
• undertake dynamic risk assessments of potential health and other impacts,
using the best available scientific advice and evidence to inform decision
making
• minimise the potential health impact by slowing spread in the UK and
overseas, and reducing infection, illness and death
• minimise the potential impact on society and the UK and global economy,
including key public services
• maintain trust and confidence amongst the organisations and people who
provide key public services, and those who use them
• ensure dignified treatment of all affected, including those who die
• be active global players - working with the World Health Organization (WHO),
the Global Health Security Initiative (GHSI), the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control (ECDC), and neighbouring countries, in supporting
international efforts to detect the emergence of a pandemic and early
assessment of the virus by sharing scientific information
• ensure that the agencies responsible for tackling the outbreak are properly
resourced to do so, that they have the people, equipment and medicines they
need, and that any necessary changes to legislation are taken forward as
quickly as possible
10
• be guided by the evidence, and regularly review research and development
needs, in collaboration with research partners, to enhance our pandemic
preparedness and response.
3.6 The UK Government and the Devolved Administrations have been planning an
initial response based on information available at the time, in a context of
uncertainty, that can be scaled up and down in response to new information to
ensure a flexible and proportionate response.
3.7 The fundamental objectives are to deploy phased actions to Contain, Delay, and
Mitigate any outbreak, using Research to inform policy development.
3.8 The different phases, types and scale of actions depends upon how the course of
the outbreak unfolds over time. We monitor local, national and international data
continuously to model what might happen next, over the immediate and longer
terms.
3.9 The overall phases of our plan to respond to COVID-19 are:
• Contain: detect early cases, follow up close contacts, and prevent the disease
taking hold in this country for as long as is reasonably possible
• Delay: slow the spread in this country, if it does take hold, lowering the peak
impact and pushing it away from the winter season
• Research: better understand the virus and the actions that will lessen its effect
on the UK population; innovate responses including diagnostics, drugs and
vaccines; use the evidence to inform the development of the most effective
models of care
• Mitigate: provide the best care possible for people who become ill, support
hospitals to maintain essential services and ensure ongoing support for people
ill in the community to minimise the overall impact of the disease on society,
public services and on the economy.

4. Our response to the current
coronavirus outbreak
Current planning
4.1 There is similarity between COVID-19 and influenza (both are respiratory
infections), but also some important differences. Consequently, contingency plans
developed for pandemic influenza17, and lessons learned from previous outbreaks,
provide a useful starting point for the development of an effective response plan to
COVID-19. That plan has been adapted, however, to take account of differences
between the two diseases. Annex A sets out the structure for the UK’s response to
a disease outbreak.
4.2 Our response to COVID-19 is guided by the international situation, the advice of
organisations such as the WHO, surveillance, data modelling based on the best
available evidence and the recommendations of our expert bodies (Annex B).
The
Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) provides expert medical
scientific advice. The four UK governments’ Chief Medical Officers (CMOs)
continue to advise the health and social care systems across the UK, and
government agencies in all parts of the UK involved in responding to this outbreak.
4.3 System wide response plans for pandemic influenza, focused on the continuity of
public and critical services and the stability of the economy, have been adapted for
COVID-19, based on the best available scientific evidence and advice.
For the
latest information on the current situation please refer to:
www.gov.uk/guidance/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-information-for-the-public.
4.4 The nature and scale of the response depends on the course of the disease,
which cannot be predicted accurately at this point. As our understanding of the
disease increases and its impact becomes clearer, we will issue further detailed
advice about what to expect if/when further measures become necessary.
The phased response - what we have done so far
4.5 As there are already cases in the UK, the current emphasis is on the Contain and
Research phases, but planning for Delay and Mitigation is already in train.
http://www.gov.uk/guidance/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-information-for-the-public
12
The Contain phase - actions to date
4.6 Across the whole of the UK, public health agencies and authorities, the NHS, and
Health and Social Care NI (HSCNI) have established plans and procedures to
detect and isolate the first cases of COVID-19 as they emerge in the UK. Each
nation's public health agencies have worked with Border Force, port operators and
carriers to enhance port health measures. PHE teams are on site at appropriate
international ports, and health advice and information has been widely cascaded,
as part of our public communications plan, with appropriate arrangements also put
in place in the Devolved Administrations (given that some aspects relating to the
arrival of aircraft and shipping are devolved).
4.7 Border Force and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) have assisted the
repatriation of British nationals and their dependents from affected areas
overseas. Where foreign nationals in the UK have been unable to return to
affected areas, the Home Office have provided support enabling them to remain in
the UK.
4.8 New regulations introduced in England under public health legislation provide new
powers for medical professionals, public health professionals and the police to
allow them to detain and direct individuals in quarantined areas at risk or
suspected of having the virus. In Scotland Health Boards have powers to place
restrictions on the activities of individuals who are known to have the disease, or
have been exposed to the disease, and to prohibit them from entering or
remaining in any place.
Boards may also apply for court orders for quarantine and
medical examination. In Wales, local authorities have powers to apply for an order
to be made by the Justice of the Peace to isolate, detain or require individuals to
undergo medical examination. Similar powers are available to the Public Health
Agency in Northern Ireland. Welsh Ministers also have powers to make regulations
equivalent to those now in place in England if the level of risk increases.
4.9 As part of the port health measures, direct flights arriving into the UK from
countries within the UK's CMOs' case definition are required to provide a
declaration (General Aircraft Declaration) to airport authorities stating that all their
passengers are well, 60 minutes prior to landing. Similarly, The Maritime Health
Declaration Form is required for all vessels arriving from any foreign port. For
Scotland parallel measures are in place.
4.10 The health and social care systems and public health authorities in all parts of the
UK have cascaded information widely to all health professionals on steps to take if
they identify patients who may have COVID-19.
4.11 The NHS/HSCNI have well rehearsed plans that have enabled the provision of
excellent care for all patients affected by this disease. The initial confirmed
13
patients are being cared for by specialist units with expertise in handling such
cases, using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread
of the virus. When necessary, the provision of care may move from specialist units
into general facilities in hospitals
4.12 The NHS/HSCNI have expert teams in every ambulance service and a number of
specialist hospital units with highly trained staff and equipment ready to receive
and care for patients – these provide coverage across the whole of the UK. If the
current outbreak takes a greater hold, we will use those lessons about effective
treatment methods and apply them throughout our health services, across all
hospital sites and into community settings.
4.13 Once a case has been detected, our public health agencies use tried and tested
procedures for rapid tracing, monitoring and isolation of close contacts, with the
aim of preventing further spread.
4.14 The UK maintains strategic stockpiles of the most important medicines and
protective equipment for healthcare staff who may come into contact with patients
with the virus. These stocks are being monitored daily, with additional stock being
ordered where necessary.
4.15 We have provided UK residents and travellers with the latest information to make
sure they know what to do if they experience symptoms and worked with NHS
111, NHS Direct Wales and NHS 24 in Scotland, to ensure people with symptoms
are given appropriate advice. Public health advice has been widely publicised and
is regularly updated at www.gov.uk/guidance/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-
information-for-the-public
4.16 FCO Travel Advice gives British nationals advice on what they need to know
before deciding whether to travel and what to do if they are affected by an
outbreak of COVID-19 while travelling.
Our Travel Advice and consular assistance
also help to contain the spread of COVID-19 to the UK.
4.17 Advice has been provided to first responders, employers, the justice system
(including prison and probation services), educational settings, and the adult social
care sector. The Department for Education provides advice about educational
settings in England, which can be found on PHE’s website.
A DfE helpline is
being set up to manage the flow of increasing queries, from providers and from
parents of pupils.
4.18 Equivalent guidance for educational settings in Scotland can be found on the
Health Protection Scotland website. This guidance provides links to further advice
via NHS Inform and contact details for local Health Protection Teams. Scottish
local authorities can also provide advice and support to education settings in their
http://www.gov.uk/guidance/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-information-for-the-public
http://www.gov.uk/guidance/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-information-for-the-public
14
areas, working closely with local Health Protection Teams and local and regional
resilience partnerships.
4.19 In Wales, guidance for educational settings is provided on the Welsh Government
website which also provides links to further public health advice -
https://gov.wales/guidance-educational-settings-about-covid-19.
4.20 Department for International Trade teams around the globe continue to support
British companies facing disruption due to the Coronavirus. The Department’s
officials across the globe are already working with UK businesses on the ground to
relay public health advice and FCO travel advice, and provide practical and
concrete support to firms, including engaging with local government and suppliers,
and working with business associations to disseminate latest information on UK
consular and visa services, and accessing existing UK Export Finance facilities.
4.21 All NHS and HSCNI emergency and urgent care facilities are working to establish
coronavirus assessment services to lessen impacts on Emergency Departments
and other clinical settings. This enables them to identify, isolate and contain cases,
separate from other patients and the public, and in a way scalable to cope with
expanding need.
Specifically tailored and effective services responding to this
outbreak have protected GPs, ambulance and hospital services for other patients.
4.22 The safety and security of British Nationals overseas will always be our top
priority. Our initial focus has been helping those Britons who have found
themselves at the greatest risk of exposure to the virus. Our crisis response team
in the FCO has been working around the clock with our Embassies throughout the
world to provide them with the care they need and reduce the risk of importation of
Coronavirus into the UK. This includes the use of quarantine and self-isolation
measures for those returning from at risk areas.
The Delay phase - actions to date
4.23 Many of the actions involved in the Contain phase also act to help Delay the onset
of an epidemic if it becomes inevitable. These include case finding and isolation of
early cases.
4.24 Many of the actions that people can take themselves - especially washing hands
more; and the catch it, bin it, kill it strategy for those with coughs and sneezes -
also help in delaying the peak of the infection.
4.25 Our experts are considering what other actions will be most effective in slowing the
spread of the virus in the UK, as more information about it emerges. Some of
these will have social costs where the benefit of doing them to Delay the peak will
15
need to be considered against the social impact. The best possible scientific
advice and other experts will inform any decision on what will be most effective.
4.26 Delaying the spread of the disease requires all of us to follow the advice set out
below. The benefits of doing so are that if the peak of the outbreak can be delayed
until the warmer months, we can reduce significantly the risk of overlapping with
seasonal flu and other challenges (societal or medical) that the colder months
bring. The Delay phase also buys time for the testing of drugs and initial
development of vaccines and/or improved therapies or tests to help reduce the
impact of the disease. There is therefore a strong dependency between the
different elements of our approach.
The Research phase - actions to date
4.27 The UK Government is liaising with the National Institute for Health Research
(NIHR), UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) including the Medical Research
Council (MRC) and other funders such as the Wellcome Trust to support and co-
ordinate research during the COVID-19 outbreak.
4.28 Our Public Health Agencies are supporting the rapid development of specific tests
for this coronavirus, in partnership with WHO and a global network of laboratories.
This has been rolled out to NHS/HSCNI laboratories across the UK to enable
faster confirmation of positive diagnoses.
4.29 The UK Government has already pledged £20 million to the Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to develop new vaccines to combat the world’s
deadliest diseases, including vaccines for COVID-19, as quickly as possible, and
is actively considering further investment.
4.30 The UK Government has also additionally announced £20 million for COVID-19
research via a joint rapid research call between UKRI and, through DHSC, the
National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).
This asks for proposals for projects
to develop vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; or to address the
epidemiology, spread or underpinning knowledge of COVID-19.
4.31 Our health and social care departments across the UK are seeking to build on the
relationships they have with institutions involved in Health Protection Research. A
number of these are involved in research in relation to the COVID-19 epidemic.
4.32 This includes one on Emergency Preparedness and Response led by King’s
College London. It brings together experts on how to conduct important research
that includes research on how to respond to infectious disease outbreaks such as
COVID-19.
16
4.33 The UK is a world leader in the field of outbreak modelling and data analytics. The
NIHR HPRU in Modelling Methodology led by Imperial College London has
developed novel analytical and computational tools which exploit novel data
streams on infectious diseases such as COVID-19. This group and other leading
academic groups have developed tools to prepare for infectious disease
outbreaks, which include real time infectious disease models, allowing policy
decisions to be made using the best possible data and are actively modelling
questions of relevance to dealing with the COVID–19 outbreak.
The role the public can play in supporting this response
4.34 Everyone can help support the UK’s response by:
• following public health authorities’ advice, for example on hand washing
• reducing the impact and spread of misinformation by relying on information
from trusted sources, such as that on www.nhs.uk/, www.nhsinform.scot,
www.publichealth.hscni.net, https://gov.wales/coronavirus-covid-19 and
www.gov.uk/
• checking and following the latest FCO travel advice when travelling and
planning to travel
• ensuring you and your family’s vaccinations are up to date as this will help
reduce the pressure on the NHS/HSCNI through reducing vaccine-preventable
diseases
• checking on elderly or vulnerable family, friends and neighbours
• using NHS 111 (or NHS 24 in Scotland or NHS Direct Wales) (including
online, where possible), pharmacies and GPs responsibly, and go to the
hospital only when you really need to. This is further explained on the NHS
website
- www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/urgent-and-emergency-
care/when-to-go-to-ae/ and http://www.choosewellwales.org.uk/home
• being understanding of the pressures the health and social care systems may
be under, and receptive to changes that may be needed to the provision of
care to you and your family.
• accepting that the advice for managing COVID-19 for most people will be self-
isolation at home and simple over the counter medicines
• checking for new advice as the situation changes.

The phased response - what we will do next
4.35 In the event of the outbreak worsening, or a severe prolonged pandemic, the
response will escalate, and the focus will move from Contain to Delay, through to
Mitigate. During this phase the pressures on services and wider society may start
to become significant and clearly noticeable.
4.36 The decision to step up the response from Contain to Delay and then Mitigate will
be taken on advice from the UK's Chief Medical Officers, taking in to account the
degree of sustained transmission and evident failure of measures in other
countries to reduce spread.
4.37 To ensure that the health and social care system is prepared to respond to all
eventualities, at all phases of a potential future pandemic, the NHS/HSCNI and
local authorities have plans in place to ensure people receive the essential care
and support services they need - and sometimes this might mean that other
services are reduced temporarily. Plans are flexible to respond to different types of
pandemics - ranging from a mild pandemic with a low impact on services (for
example the 2009 H1N1 pandemic), through to a severe prolonged pandemic as
experienced in 1918 (""Spanish Flu"").
4.38 Similarly, potential pandemics are one of a wide range of risks that the owners and
operators of our most essential services and systems plan for. The UK
Government and Devolved Administrations are currently working with our critical
national infrastructure partners to ensure that these plans are appropriate for
COVID-19, and that we minimise any impacts that could disrupt the daily services
on which the UK depends.
4.39 The Ministry of Defence has put in place plans to ensure the delivery of its key
operations in the UK and overseas. There are also well practised arrangements for
Defence to provide support to Civil Authorities if requested.
4.40 The UK Government will also step up the central co-ordination of its overall
response using its proven crisis management mechanisms: COBR would meet as
often as needed, bringing in system leaders to co-ordinate vital public services;
and there will be more communication with Parliament, the media and the public.
Ministers from across government will be designated to lead for their department
on handling the outbreak; with senior officials and system leaders working
intensively alongside them. The respective crisis management mechanisms
across the Devolved Administrations have also been stood up and will operate in
very similar terms to that of COBR within their own nations, and all four co-
ordination centres are linked up on UK-wide planning and delivery of the response
to Covid-19.
18
4.41 There will be regular meetings between the UK Government, and NHS/HSCNI and
public health leaders, chaired alternately by the Secretary of State for Health and
Social Care and his Permanent Secretary, to discuss the most recent advice from
scientific experts and those delivering key services, and to decide next steps.
The Delay phase - next steps
4.42 If the disease becomes established in the UK, we will need to consider further
measures to reduce the rate and extent of its spread. Based on experience with
previous outbreaks, it may be that widespread exposure in the UK is inevitable;
but slowing it down would still nonetheless be beneficial. For example, health
services are less busy in the summer months when flu and other winter bugs are
not driving GP consultations and hospital admissions. In the 2009 ‘swine flu’
pandemic school holidays significantly slowed transmission of the virus.
4.43 We will increase publicity about the need for good hygiene measures (hand
washing, and catch it, bin it, kill it) and further promote the need for people with
symptoms to stay at home for the full duration of their illness.
4.44 Other action will be considered to help achieve a Delay in the spread of the
disease. We will aim to minimise the social and economic impact, subject to
keeping people safe. Such judgements will be informed based on the best
available and most up to date scientific evidence, and take into account the trade-
offs involved.
4.45 Action that would be considered could include population distancing strategies
(such as school closures, encouraging greater home working, reducing the
number of large scale gatherings) to slow the spread of the disease throughout the
population, whilst ensuring the country’s ability to continue to run as normally as
possible. The UK governments' education departments' planning assumptions
include the possibility of having to close educational settings in order to reduce the
spread of infection.
4.46 We would consider such measures in order to protect vulnerable individuals with
underlying illnesses and thus at greater more at risk of becoming seriously
affected by the disease. The effectiveness of these actions will need to be
balanced against their impact on society.
The Research phase - next steps
4.47 It is possible that an outbreak or pandemic of COVID-19 could occur in multiple
waves (it is not known yet if the disease will have a seasonal pattern, like flu) and
therefore, depending upon what the emerging evidence starts to tell us, it may be
19
necessary to ensure readiness for a future wave of activity.
The intention is to
gather evidence about effective interventions in order to inform decision-making
going forward. The UK Government will keep emerging research needs under
close review and progress research activities set out above.
The Mitigate phase - next steps
4.48 As and when the disease moves into different phases, for example if transmission
of the virus becomes established in the UK population, the nature and scale of the
response will change. The chief focus will be to provide essential services, helping
those most at risk to access the right treatment. This means that:
• there will be further publicity of advice to individuals about protecting
themselves and others
• treatment and the requirement for medicines and other clinical
countermeasures might start to increase, with the need to draw down on
existing stockpiles of the most important medicines, medical devices and
clinical consumables
• health and social care services will work together to support early discharge
from hospital, and to look after people in their own homes
• emergency services, including the police and fire and rescue services will
enact business continuity plans to ensure they are able to maintain a level of
service that fulfils their critical functions. For example, with a significant loss of
officers and staff, the police would concentrate on responding to serious
crimes and maintaining public order
• for businesses facing short term cash flow issues (for example, as the result of
subdued demand), an effective mitigation already exists in HMRC’s Time To
Pay system. This is offered on a case by case basis if a firm or individual
contacts HMRC about falling behind on their tax
• as NHS/HSCNI staff also start to become affected, and more seriously ill
patients require admission, clinicians may recommend a significantly different
approach to admissions. Some non-urgent care may be delayed to prioritise
and triage service delivery. Staff rostering changes may be necessary,
including calling leavers and retirees back to duty
• there could well be an increase in deaths arising from the outbreak,
particularly amongst vulnerable and elderly groups. The UK Government and
Devolved Administrations will provide advice for local authorities on dealing
with this challenge
20
• there will be less emphasis on large scale preventative measures such as
intensive contact tracing. As the disease becomes established, these
measures may lose their effectiveness and resources would be more
effectively used elsewhere.
4.49 Everyone will face increased pressures at work, as well as potentially their own
personal illness or caring responsibilities. Supporting staff welfare will be critical to
supporting an extended response.
4.50 We will implement a distribution strategy for the UK’s stockpiles of key medicines
and equipment (e.g. protective clothing). This will cover the NHS/HSCNI, and
extend to social care and other sectors as appropriate.
4.51 We will consider legislative options, if necessary, to help systems and services
work more effectively in tackling the outbreak.
4.52 The UK’s health and social care systems will start to implement their business
continuity plans, which cover:
• continuing to minimise the risk of infection to patients and those receiving care
• further identification of vulnerable persons to be supported
• arrangements for the continuation of essential services, to maintain normal
business for as many people as possible for as long as possible
• plans to reduce the impact of absentees during the pandemic
• systems to lessen the impact of disruption to society and the supply chain.
4.53 The UK remains in a high state of readiness to respond robustly to any disease
outbreak, and our track record of success means that we can offer a high degree
of assurance that we will be able to maximise the effectiveness of our health and
care systems, and in doing so also respond effectively to the outbreak.
4.54 As and when we discover more about the disease and what, if any, impact its
course has on the UK, we will provide further updates on how our plans are being
adapted to respond to specific, changing circumstances.
4.55 The UK Government is advising businesses to build their own resilience by
reviewing their business continuity plans and following the advice for employers
available on GOV.UK - www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-
employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19
http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19
http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19
21
4.56 Businesses should also ensure that they keep up to date with the situation as it
changes, at: www.gov.uk/coronavirus.

Annex A - responsibilities for pandemic
preparedness and response
National responsibilities
The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is the lead UK Government
Department with responsibility for responding to the risk posed by a future pandemic.
The four UK CMOs provide public health advice to the whole system and government
throughout the UK. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) is responsible
for ensuring that a single source of coordinated scientific advice is provided to decision
makers in COBR.
The NHS works in partnership with Local Resilience Forums on pandemic preparedness
and response delivery in healthcare systems in England and Wales. Public Health England
provides specialist technical expertise to support both planning and delivery arrangements
in England, working closely with public health agencies in Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland. These organisations have developed plans for coordinating the response at a
national level and supporting local responders through their regional structures. The tri-
partite partnership of DHSC, PHE and NHS England provides strategic oversight and
direction for the health and adult social care response to an influenza pandemic, with
Department for Education (DfE) leading on the children's social care response. In
Devolved Administrations, there are similar arrangements for multi-agency working with
strategic oversight
provided by the appropriate departments. These arrangements are
supported by national co-ordination structures.
PHE and their equivalent in the Devolved Administrations lead the provision of expert
advice on health protection issues and actively contributes to the planning and delivery of
a multi-agency response. PHE provides health protection services, expertise and advice,
delivering specialist public health services to UK national and local government (in
England), the NHS/HSCNI and the public, working in partnership to protect the public
against infectious diseases. There are comparable public health expert advisory support
arrangements in each of the other three UK countries.
Local/Regional responsibilities
In England and Wales, local organisations (working jointly through the Local Resilience
Forums and Local Health Resilience Partnerships in England, and NHS emergency
planning structures in Wales) have the primary responsibility for planning for and
responding to any major emergency, including a pandemic. Similar arrangements exist in
23
Scotland working through Regional Resilience and Local Resilience Partnerships. In
Northern Ireland, Emergency Preparedness Groups coordinate emergency planning at the
local level.
Multi-agency working
Multi-agency working at both a national and local level ensures joint planning between all
organisations. A coordinated approach to ensure best use of resources to achieve the best
outcome for the local area.
NHS England and NHS Improvement and partners have published a series of quick guides
to assist multi-agency working and support local health and care systems manage
increasing demand on their services. The series of guides can be found at
www.nhs.uk/quickguides. Integration Authorities in Scotland have access to a range of
government advice on priorities for multi-agency working, which supports existing local
plans to optimise care pathways.
Social care is provided by a diverse range of local authority, private and third sector
bodies. It is important that the role of social care provision in all sectors is central to
contingency planning. Social care providers should remain in contact with local
commissioners and resilience partners, review their business continuity plans and continue
to practice proper infection control and good respiratory hygiene practice.
Other key public services
The Ministry of Justice’s HM Courts & Tribunal Service have well established plans to
deliver key services to protect the public and maintain confidence in the justice system.
Similar plans are in place in the Devolved Administrations.
http://www.nhs.uk/quickguides
24
Annex B - expert advice and guidance
The UK Government and the Devolved Administrations have ensured that all of our
actions are based on the best possible evidence, and are guided by the four UK CMOs.
The UK health departments preparations and response are developed with expert advice,
ensuring that staff, patients and the wider public can be confident that our plans are
developed and implemented using the best available evidence. These groups include:
• the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) – Chaired by the Government
Chief Scientific Adviser and co-chaired by the CMO for England - provides scientific
and technical advice to support government decision makers during emergencies,
ensuring that timely and coordinated scientific advice is made available to decision
makers to support UK cross-government decisions in the UK Cabinet Office Briefing
Room
• the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) is an
expert committee of DHSC and advises the CMOs and, through the CMOs, ministers,
DHSC and other Government departments, and the Devolved Administrations. It
provides scientific risk assessment and mitigation advice on the threat posed by new
and emerging respiratory virus threats and on options for their management
• the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) - provides independent
scientific advice to the Health and Safety Executive, to Ministers in DHSC and DEFRA,
and to their counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on all aspects of
hazards and risks to workers and others from exposure to pathogens
• the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) - gives expert advice to
the Department of Health and Social Care and wider UK government and the
Devolved Administrations on scientific matters relating to the UK’s response to an
influenza pandemic (or other emerging human infectious disease threats). The advice
is based on infectious disease modelling and epidemiology
• the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advises UK health
departments on immunisation
• FCO Travel Advice is informed by PHE and DHSC advice and gives British nationals
advice on what they need to know before deciding whether to travel and what to do if

Simon Stevens and Amanda Pritchard sent a letter to all NHS senior leaders on 17 March setting out the
steps that are being taken to support the NHS response to COVID-19. Part of that letter said:
Support our staff, and maximise staff availability
b) For those staff affected by PHE’s 14 day household isolation policy, staff should – on an entirely voluntary
basis – be offered the alternative option of staying in NHS-reimbursed hotel accommodation while they
continue to work.
NHS England and NHS Improvement have established a single process for NHS staff to secure
accommodation at hotels within their immediate area, if they have been affected by COVID-19 in some way.
The national response provides easy access to staff and while initially it will be a single phone number, in
due course it will also be available via an online portal.
Details on accessing the service are on the next slide, and the expectation is that the following staff groups
should be provided support:
• NHS staff who, as per the letter of 17 March, need hotel accommodation
• NHS staff whose family members are self-isolating and staff are not able to return home
• NHS staff who require emergency accommodation due to urgent response or mitigating factors
• Clinical Commissioning Groups can also provide accommodation to locum GPs/GPs and Community
Interest Company staff who are contracted to provide clinical services on a request and exception basis

NHS staff who require accommodation at a hotel should:
Confirm with their line manager that accommodation is required; the line manager should then inform
the relevant finance team that bookings are being made so that this can be tracked by finance teams.
Contact CTM call centre on 01274 726424 (choosing ‘Hotel team’, then ‘Option 1’).
The booker should then be prepared to provide:
• Project code: NHS Support
• Guest name
• Telephone number for emergency
• Email address for confirmation
• Organisation name
• Organisation cost code
• Department
• Job title
Central Booking System

The supplier of the service is CTM. In due course, an online booking system will be made available in
addition to the phone number.
CTM has national agreements with a wide number of hotel operators across the country. They will be
able to confirm availability at hotels as close to the required location as possible, however, certain
conditions will apply:
• Hotels should be informed as soon as possible if rooms are going to be cancelled, or room stays
are being extended
• Standard NHS England charges apply: outside of London the budget is £100 per night, within
London £150 per night
• We are working with hotels so that over the next few weeks as many rooms as possible come with
food included in the room rate
• Where food is currently not included, or where there are additional expenses for meals or sundry
items, please agree with your line manager and direct this to your employer rather than adding it to
the hotel bill.
• Hotels booked outside of this process will not be paid for through central finance
• The cost of the rooms will be paid on a central basis, but charged to the organisation’s cost code
connected to the COVID-19 response

NHS Staff Hotel Accommodation

Hotel accommodation will be available to a range of health bodies and therefore members of staff of a
number of organisations will be sharing common areas within the hotels. This may obviously increase
the risk of passing the virus between healthcare colleagues working in different environments. We are
therefore requesting that where possible staff:
• Minimise time in communal areas of the hotel including receptions and corridors to reduce risk of
infection to colleagues.
• Where possible, to limit to 1 or 2 people at a time in lifts where possible, or to use the stairs if
appropriate.
• Ideally eat in your room. If meals are provided within the hotel, please try to sit at tables at least 2
metres apart from other residents in any bar or restaurant.
• We will be working with the hotels and providing guidance so they are aware of this and are
working to support you.
• We will update this hotel guidance pack and systems in due course, including a web portal to
make online bookings.

To cancer alliance
It is important that during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, appropriate
clinical priority is given in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and we
understand that service provision may need to flex as part of infection
control. The guidance below should be interpreted as modifying existing
Cancer Waiting Times guidance with immediate effect (19 March 2020) until
further notice:
• On receipt of a 2ww referral, providers should ensure that as far as
possible telephone triage is available to stream patients directly to a
test where appropriate and minimise interactions and appointments
with health services.
• A telephone appointment with an appropriate specialist clinician as
detailed in Cancer Waiting Times guidance will be accepted as ‘first
appointment’ for the purposes of recording Cancer Waiting Times data
until further notice.
• The policy remains that providers receiving referrals
may not downgrade urgent cancer referrals without the consent of the
referring primary care professional. Where capacity is particularly
constrained providers should ensure processes are in place to
prioritise particularly urgent referrals, including greater communication
between primary and secondary care to downgrade or avoid referrals
where possible.
• Where referrals are downgraded or avoided outside the usual policies
and NICE guidance, providers should seek to ensure appropriate
safety-netting so that if patients deteriorate or their risk of a cancer
diagnosis increases, they can be appropriately referred for further
investigation.
All providers receiving cancer referrals should continue to stay alert to
any further changes in this advice following updates from Government and
NHS England and NHS Improvement.

Dear Colleague,
We are writing to ask for your help with the management and shielding of patients
who are at the highest risk of severe morbidity and mortality from coronavirus
(COVID-19).
On Monday 16th March the UK government announced a package of measures,
advising those who are or may be at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19
to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures.
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-
and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-
protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults
This group has been identified to the public as those who are:
• aged 70 or older (regardless of medical conditions)
• under 70 with an underlying health condition listed below (i.e. anyone
instructed to get a flu jab as an adult each year on medical grounds):
• chronic (long-term) respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema or bronchitis
• chronic heart disease, such as heart failure
• chronic kidney disease
• chronic liver disease, such as hepatitis
• chronic neurological conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, motor neurone
disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), a learning disability or cerebral palsy
• diabetes
• problems with your spleen – for example, sickle cell disease or if you have
had your spleen removed
• a weakened immune system as the result of conditions such as HIV and
AIDS, or medicines such as steroid tablets or chemotherapy
• being seriously overweight (a BMI of 40 or above)
• those who are pregnant
This wider group, who broadly speaking comprise the criteria of adults eligible for an
annual flu vaccine, will not be proactively contacted but have instead been asked to
take steps to reduce their social interactions in order to reduce the transmission of
coronavirus.
There is a subset of this group who have clinical conditions which are likely to put
people at the highest risk of mortality and severe morbidity from COVID-19. We have
identified this group, based on expert consensus. More detailed information about
your essential role in this process is outlined in attached letter from Dr Nikita Kanani
and Ed Waller.
Given the difficulties of identifying those most vulnerable for some

patients, in some cases this is going to require some clinical judgements by you
about your patients. You may know of specific additional patients in your practice
who you think are particularly high risk. On the other hand there are a limited number
of people that we can shield effectively or for whom this highly socially isolating
measure would be proportionate on health grounds; many patients who fulfil the
criteria may after discussion with you prefer not to be placed under such strict
isolation for what will be a prolonged period.
Further broad information about the
methodology we followed to identify this group is contained in Annex 1.
We recognise the significant pressures that GP practices are under, which the
necessity to self-isolate staff where they have symptoms compatible with coronavirus
has inevitably made more acute. We also know the changing pace of guidance and
requests that we make of you in support of your patients, as a result of the need to
address this new global pandemic, are significant. We massively appreciate all the
efforts GPs and other primary care staff are making, and will make, to care for
patients and communities at this difficult time, and know the public does as well. A
letter from Nikki Kanani and Ed Waller has been issued on the 19 March outlining
the current situation and highlighting the work that can be stopped in general
practice. A further letter from Nikki and Ed to support this process is attached in
annex 2.
Please accept our sincere thanks for your expertise, help, patience and support at
this challenging time.

Annex 1 – Identification of Vulnerable Groups: Methods
This annex explains the basis of the latest advice that has been sent to all patients
who are considered to be at highest risk of mortality and severe morbidity from
coronavirus (COVID-19). Emerging clinical data about COVID-19 indicated that the
death rate would be high for groups of people with particular chronic diseases. The
modelling suggests that if we were able to effectively shield these people it would
have a significant positive effect on the fatality rate in that group and overall (but a
modest effect on the overall curve). This group has therefore been recommended to
undertake shielding measures for their own protection.
In order to be effective these people would have to undergo strict social isolation with
no contact from the outside world beyond that absolutely necessary, for a period of
at least 12 weeks. A move which will significantly impact quality of life, increase
social isolation, and would not be without its own attendant physical and mental
health risks. We therefore drew up a list of conditions which we felt would justify
affected individuals taking such extreme measures. This group are a subset of a
wider more generally vulnerable group (broadly any adult eligible for an annual flu
vaccine), who have already been advised to follow social distancing measures to
reduce their number of contacts for a period of at least 12 weeks.
We developed a four pronged approach towards ensuring coverage across affected
groups by 1) identifying a core group of patients to be contacted centrally by NHS
England; 2) providing guidance to medical subspecialties in
secondary care and
asking them to identify and contact additional patients in their caseload who fall
under Group 1 category 5; 3) working with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges
to cascade general guidance for hospital specialties to help them identify and contact
further high risk patients from their caseload; 4) working with RCGP to issue
guidance to GPs to help them identify and contact high risk patients from their own
caseload (for example those with severe multimorbidity).
Group 1
We took the following steps when drawing up the list of patients who can be
identified centrally by extracting relevant groups from national datasets:
a) NHS England Clinical Reference Groups (groups of experts who advise the
NHS on Direct Commissioning) were asked to consider which conditions
would put patients at intermediate, high or very high risk of severe morbidity
or mortality from COVID-19
b) Based on our current understanding and specialist and wider advice senior
clinicians (NHSE, NHS Digital, PHE, CMO, DCMOs) categorised these
conditions into the following high risk groups (see below)
1. Solid organ transplant recipients
2. People with specific cancers
• People with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radical
radiotherapy for lung cancer
• People with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia,
lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment
• People having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments
for cancer
• People having other targeted cancer treatments which can affect the
immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors.
• People who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last
6 months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs.
3. People with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic
fibrosis, severe asthma and severe COPD
4. People with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that
significantly increase the risk of infections (such as SCID,
homozygous sickle cell disease)
5. People on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly
increase risk of infection
6. People who are pregnant with significant heart disease, congenital or
acquired
Group 2
There are some patients on this list who will be contacted by other routes due to
limitations in national datasets. For example, Cancer Units will contact all patients in
category 2; secondary care will contact most of the patients in category 5 via a
cascade from the Royal College of Physicians and associated medical societies
Group 3
In addition, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges will ask its members to identify
any other subgroups of patients they feel are at high risk, and will cascade templates
to hospital specialists. We will ask clinicians who have identified these patients to let
them know directly using a standard letter containing the information they need to
commence shielding and access support. We will ask hospital specialists to inform
the GP of the decision to include patients in the vulnerable group.
Group 4
In addition, we will issue GPs with specific guidance around identification of high risk
patients with complex / severe multimorbidity and ask the GP to contact these
groups directly to recommend they are considered for inclusion in the shielding
group.
We accept that given this is a new and rapidly moving disease there are inevitable
limitations in our methodology but have designed the most robust approach that was
possible at pace with the aim of identifying the maximum number of vulnerable
individuals in sufficient time to effectively shield this group.",e89a83f7-8092-4c29-b914-190874a9078d.pdf

COVID-19 Prioritisation within Community Health Services
Following on from Sir Simon Stevens’ and Amanda Pritchard’s letter of 17 March 2020, this letter
and annex set out how providers of community services can release capacity to support the COVID-
19 preparedness and response. These arrangements will apply until 31 July 2020 in the first in-
stance.
The current priorities for providers of community services during this pandemic are:
1. Support home discharge today of patients from acute and community beds, as mandated in
the new Hospital Discharge Service Requirements, and ensure patients cared for at home
receive urgent care when they need it
2. By default, use digital technology to provide advice and support to patients wherever possi-
ble
3. Prioritise support for high-risk individuals who will be advised to self-isolate for 12 weeks.
Further advice on this will be published shortly.
4. Apply the principle of mutual aid with health and social care partners, as decided through
your local resilience forum.
Thank you for your support and the important work you are undertaking.

Coronavirus?
It is important that our hospitals are ready to look after
people who contract coronavirus (COVID-19) and need
hospital care. Due to these pressures, once you no longer
need care in hospital, as decided by the health team
looking after you, you will be discharged. You will not have
a choice over your discharge, but it is always our priority
to discharge people to a safe and appropriate place.
In most cases this will be
to your home. You might
need some extra support,
for example with your
care needs or shopping.
If you require more
complex out of hospital
care, this could be in
another bed in the
community, for example
a residential nursing
home.
Your needs and
discharge arrangements
will be discussed with
you.
COVID-19 is a new illness
that can affect the lungs and
airways. It is caused by a virus
called coronavirus.
You can find out more about
coronavirus and the best ways to
stop it spreading by visiting
www.nhs.uk/coronavirus
There is currently no specific
treatment and some people who
contract the illness will need to
be admitted to hospital.

Equipment (RPE)
Why are the FFP3 respirators
(masks) provided different to the
usual ones we use?
Due to the sudden increase in demand to use FFP3
masks due to COVID-19, supply chain is using supplies
put aside for pandemic flu. They offer the same level of
protection but are a different design and model.
Why do the FFP3 masks have a
different expiry date?
Some products may appear to have out-of-date ‘use
by/expiration’ dates or have relabelled ‘use by/expiration’
dates. Please be assured products we are issuing have
passed stringent tests that demonstrate they are safe.
The PPE is exposed to extreme conditions for prolonged
periods to see how the product deteriorates. Any that are
not up to standard are destroyed and are not distributed
to trusts.
Why do I need to be ‘Fit tested’
again?
The performance of tight-fitting facepieces depends on
achieving a good contact between the wearer’s skin
and the face seal of the facepiece. Each model of FFP3
mask is slightly different in its fit to each individual face.
The only way to ensure that it will protect you is to repeat
the Fit test again with each model of mask provided.
This
process to fit check is required every time used
If I was ‘Fit tested’ to the make and
model in 2009, do I need to do it
again?
Provided your face shape has not changed since
2009 (weight changes, dental/facial surgery, facial
moles/growths in seal area). It is possible that it may not
be necessary. Do a Fit-check retest if in doubt!
What can I do if we are unable to
meet demand for Fit Testing?
There is an expectation that teams will need to prioritise
Fit-testing for staff groups working in high risk areas. In
recognition of this challenge PHE have engaged the
services of RPA (an independent Respiratory Protective
Equipment (RPE) fit testing company), to offer free
immediate support to trusts (England only) who are being
asked to use FFP3 respirators that may not be their
Business as Usual (BAU) respirator of choice. Booking on
to these courses is via RPA’s helpline on 07947 968972
and 07947 968922. This service will provide a helpline re
training challenges and on-line training on how to run Fit
Test Training.
A local risk assessment will need to be completed.
Follow the most recent Infection Prevention Guidance
We work in an area that is seeing
many symptomatic patients and want
to wear an FFP3 mask but do not
have access to them?
FFP3 masks are only required when managing a
patient/client with possible/confirmed COVID-19 who
is undergoing an Aerosol generating Procedure
(AGP) and when there are COVID-19 patients in High
risk unit (ICU/ITU/HDU). The masks are only protective if
you have been trained and tested in the correct method of
application. If you are looking after this group of patients
and there is a possibility that they have COVID-19 please
escalate the need for urgent training through your
emergency planning and response leads.
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/872745/Infection_prevention_and_control_guidance_for_pandemic_coronavirus.pdf
When should I use FFP3 masks? FFP3 masks are only required when undertaking Aerosol
Generating Procedures (AGP).
This is because the AGP
process generates aerosols (≤5µm) which can result in
exposure to aerosol viral particles. They should also be
worn when you are caring for COVID-19 patients in a
High-risk unit (ICU/ITU/HDU) because lots of aerosols will
be generated.
Definition of AGPs can be found in section 6 of Infection
Prevention Guidance
How long can FFP3 masks be worn
for?
FFP3 masks are tested to ensure they remain effective.
Provided the seal remains intact, they can be worn
comfortably for at least an hour but are effective for
longer unless compromised, eg splashed with body fluids,
damp with respiration. Please refer to the manufacturers’
guidance for maximum duration. This means the masks, if
in full working order and fitted properly, can be worn
constantly for that period of time, while changing other
PPE between patients and cleaning hands. If the mask is
removed please dispose of as orange bag, (category B)
waste, clean hands and change other PPE before
reapplying new masks.
Do I need to wear a FFP3 when
caring for a ventilated patient?
Yes, because although it’s a closed circuit there is a risk
of accidental disconnection of equipment. The circuit is
also opened when patients are undergoing respiratory
physio, being weaned or transported.
If caring for patients in a cohort do I
need to change FFP3 masks
between each patient like gloves and
aprons?
If you are working in Intensive care/High dependency
where several symptomatic patients are cohorted, the
FFP3 masks can be used continually, provided the seal
remains intact for at least an hour, please refer to
manufacturers’ guidance for maximum duration. Please
ensure staff are adequately hydrated prior to applying the
mask.
We are running short of FFP3 masks
how are we to manage our patients
safely?
Masks must only be used as directed and for staff
providing direct care. Masks can be worn for prolonged
periods (as above) and unlike gloves and apron, do not
need to be changed between patients. If a member of
staff does not need to go into the risk area, they should
be kept out.
Why has the guidance changed to
say we can use a fluid repellent
surgical mask (FRSM) when caring
for patients?
COVID-19 is transmitted through respiratory droplets, the
evidence shows that in most cases when delivering direct
care, a FRSM mask will provide adequate protection.
Changing the current PPE guidance means that we will
be able to ensure that the right equipment is used by the
right person at the right time based on the transmission
risk. Table 1 in the Section 6 of the Infection Prevention
Guidance provides guidance of what PPE is required for
each situation.

2. Identifying a location
Current capabilities
Assess current facilities’ capabilities for creation of adequate isolation rooms or
areas, identifying potential areas that could be converted effectively with minimum
modifications.
This is best carried out through a desktop planning exercise using recent hospital
plans. Focus on existing wards, theatres or catheterisation labs, including prep and
scrub areas.
• Avoid any through routes for non-COVID-19 traffic.
• Consider logistical flows of clean and dirty waste.
• You must maintain fire evacuation routes.
Special environmental controls, such as negative pressure isolation rooms, are not
necessary to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. However, in the early stages
and in high-risk settings, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may be
isolated in negative-pressure rooms.
Self-contained areas
Where possible, a designated self-contained area or wing of the healthcare facility
should be used for the treatment and care of patients with COVID-19. This area
should:
• include a reception area that is separate from the rest of the facility and, if
feasible, have a separate entrance/exit from that for the rest of the building
• not be used as a thoroughfare by other patients, visitors or staff, including
patients being transferred, staff going for meal breaks, and staff and visitors
entering and exiting the building
• be separated from non-segregated areas by closed doors
• have signage displayed warning of the segregated area to control entry.

Design note: COVID-19 ward for intubated patients
Use single rooms
Wherever possible, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be
placed in single rooms.
Organisation
Consider creating cohort areas which differentiate the level of care required. It may
also be prudent to consider:
• the need for cohorting in single/mixed-sex wards/bays
• underlying patient condition (immunocompromised)
• age groups when cohorting children
• routine childhood vaccination status when cohorting children.
Thresholds and entrances
Once potential areas for treatment of COVID-19 patients have been identified,
consider the support required. Hospitals should provide changing rooms/areas
where staff can change into uniforms on arrival at work. These may already exist.
Those entering a COVID-19 area will require personal protective equipment (PPE).
Identify the location of the clean PPE store and space to change at the
gateway/threshold of COVID-19 areas. A changing space should have scrub
facilities and clean PPE storage.
All linen should be handled inside the patient room/cohort area. Clean linen should
be stored adjacent to the entrance for supply.
Store all used/infectious linen in a designated, safe, lockable area while awaiting
uplift. Also locate space for dirty PPE change and disposal.
Infection control
It is unlikely the individual clinical wash basins are likely to be available for each
bed. Make use of what is available.
All staff, patients and visitors should decontaminate their hands with alcohol-based
hand rub (ABHR) when entering and leaving areas where suspected and confirmed
Version 1.0: 22 March 2020

|
Design note: COVID-19 ward for intubated patients
COVID-19 patients are being cared for. Identify the location of the AHBR dispenser
at each treatment/bed location.
Tissues, waste bins (lined and foot operated) and hand hygiene facilities should be
available for patients, visitors and staff. Hands-free waste bins, with appropriate
colour-coded waste bags, should be provided by each wash-hand basin.
Fire risk assessment
The fire risk assessment for the area being converted should be reviewed in view of
a higher life safety sleeping risk cohort and the additional issue of more oxygen
being in use. This may increase staffing levels or require modified PHE.
Refer to HTM 05-03 Part K (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/suite-of-
guidance-on-fire-safety-throughout-healthcare-premises-parts-a-to-m) and the
relevant fire code sections as they apply:
• https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-healthcare-fire-
safety
• https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-in-support-of-
functional-provisions-for-healthcare-premises
• https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/suite-of-guidance-on-fire-
safety-throughout-healthcare-premises-parts-a-to-m
This review should be carried out by the trust fire safety advisor using their local
knowledge of the site and training levels.
Ventilation
The density of ventilators may enrich the air with oxygen, increasing the combustion
risk. Ensure there is good natural and mechanical ventilation.

3. Design considerations
Risk
In planning COVID-19 facilities, review the range of construction risks, including
asbestos, vibration, dust and fungal disturbance and take action to mitigate them. In
addition, consider:
• delineating an area for COVID-19 treatment so that the boundaries align
with existing fire compartments
• invasive construction work should only start once the asbestos risk has
been established
• where new or additional services are to be installed, suitable permanent or
temporary fire stopping should be provided for any wall or floor
penetrations, to maintain the fire integrity of the penetrated structure.
Activities
• Caring for a patient who is likely to require intubation and will need
continuous medical and nursing care using piped medical gases; vacuum
and life-support system using isolation procedures.
• Medical and nursing procedures requiring minimum three-sided access to
patient while one to four staff use specialised equipment.
• Monitoring vital physiological signs.
• Clinical handwashing.
• Monitoring/diagnostic or therapeutic equipment will be used.
• Resuscitation trolley and associated equipment may be used.
• Patient will arrive on trolley.
• Mobile hoist may be used.
• A working supply of clean and sterile items is stored for immediate use.

Planning relationships
It is envisaged that this bed space will be required to supplement existing facilities
in response to demand during the pandemic, and could be rapidly deployed by
refurbishing/redesignating existing facilities or by providing a ‘quick-build’ solution
using prefabricated units. Where a multiple bed space is used, a minimum space of
3.6 metres, bed centre – bed centre is recommended.
Space data: Area (m²)

4. Engineering
Systems affected
• Medical oxygen: liquid and gas cylinder supplies.
• Medical vacuum: with respect to recommendation not to provide piped
vacuum in infectious diseases units (IDU).
Responsible parties
The following responsible parties should liaise to manage and treat:
• clinical managers
• clinical department heads
• infection control
• pathology
• pharmacy
• estates and facilities
• external medical gas suppliers.
Other parties who may be required to assist and advise:
• NHS England and NHS Improvement Estates
• medical gas authorising engineer
• medical gas contractors
• medical physics/electronic and biomedical engineering (EBME)
• medical device suppliers (oxygen concentrators).
Medical oxygen
The Department of Health and Social Care has stipulated the need to establish if
existing medical oxygen systems can accommodate the supply of medical oxygen
at a flow rate of 10 L/min, per bed. The main factors to consider are as follows:
Version 1.0: 22 March 2020
12
|
Design note: COVID-19 ward for intubated patients
The number and location of beds specifically selected to facilitate the
anticipated COVID-19 infected patients. The purpose of asking this is to establish
if existing departments were designed with hi-flow oxygen demand or if the
department was designed for acute patient care. For example:
• within existing IDUs
• acute wards (single and multi-bedroom)
• critical care such as ITU/PICU/HDU.
The type of source of supply:
• Bulk liquid oxygen plant (VIE): note this could include:
– one compound comprising single vessels and gas manifolds
– one compound comprising duplex vessels
– two compounds each comprising duplex vessels feeding into separate
parts of the mains distribution (diverse routes).
• Liquid mini-tank and gas manifolds.
• Liquid cylinders and gas manifold: specific to BOC.
• High pressure medical gas cylinders connected to an auto-change
manifold, including manual emergency reserve manifold.
• Portable medical gas cylinders:
– J size cylinder and back feed kit for connection to AVSU NIST
connectors
– CD, HX, etc size cylinders for individual patient administration
– oxygen concentrators for individual patient administration.
Limiting factors
To establish if your source supply and distribution systems can cope with
increased, extensive demand, consider the following:
• Ask your liquid oxygen plant or manifold supplier/manufacture what the
following are:
– the flowrate capability of each evaporator. This will determine the
maximum flowrate the evaporators can maintain without detrimental
effect on distribution pressure
Version 1.0: 22 March 2020
13
|
Design note: COVID-19 ward for intubated patients
– the flowrate capability of each pressure regulator. This will determine
the maximum flowrate the regulators can supply without detrimental
effect on distribution pressure.
• Once it has been established in which departments the increased oxygen
demand will be imposed:
– check mains distribution pipe sizes. This will determine the maximum
flowrate at which the pipeline can maintain supply without detrimental
effect on site-wide distribution pressure.
• Check departmental distribution pipe sizes. This will determine the
maximum flowrate at which the pipeline can maintain supply without
detrimental effect on local distribution pressure.
Action to be taken
The initial steps are:
• In conjunction with clinical managers, establish the number of bed spaces
that can provide adequate isolation and treatment of COVID-19 infected
patients. Ensure that the beds are provided with at least one medical
oxygen supply terminal unit.
• Beds that must retain critical oxygen supplies, eg critical care, emergency
department (ED) fesuscitation, and other departments/rooms in this
category will retain the supply of oxygen.
• Based on the number of bed spaces identified for isolation and treatment of
COVID-19 infected patients, calculate the expected total flow during
simultaneous demand, eg 10 L/min (per patient) x 100 (number of beds) =
1,000 L/min (COVID-19 total flow).
Note: This should be offset against the original design and other departments that
will still require the HTM 02-01 recommended diversified flow for areas such as:
operating theatres, theatre recovery, critical care, ED resuscitation, etc. For
example:
• Total offset diversified flow (TODF) (excluding COVID-19 total flow) +
COVID-19 total flow (TF) = total COVID-19 enhanced flow. Example:
Original total diversified flow = 3,000 L/min; COVID-19 TF = 1,000 L/min;
Version 1.0: 22 March 2020
14
|
Design note: COVID-19 ward for intubated patients
TOFD = 2,750 L/min. Therefore, total COVID-19 enhanced flow 2,750 +
1,000 = 3,750 L/min.
As can be seen, the additional flow imposes a 25% increase on the original design
flow. In this instance, the additional demand should be well within the capability of
the existing liquid source supply.
• Review the medical oxygen source supply to establish that the storage
capacity of the liquid and/or the oxygen cylinder source supplies are
adequate and that the medical oxygen supplier (Air Products or BOC) can
replenish for extended periods of time.
• Consider reducing the consumption of ‘piped’ medical oxygen for less
critical departments, eg outpatient department (OPD), radiology, and use
portable cylinders or oxygen concentrators.
• Where ventilators are to be used, the following will be considered:
– quantity of ventilators
– type of ventilator including manufacturer and model
– maximum and normal flow rates and pressures
– location where ventilators will be used.
• The purpose of this is to ensure that, where ventilators are to be used, they
will not adversely impact on the normal operation of the plant.
Plant operation
Where oxygen consumption will increase, the following condition may be
evident:
• Liquid oxygen plant mains pipeline pressure reduces to the low-level
pressure setting of 3.85 bar. At this pressure the plant alarm will alert to
pipeline pressure fault at the plant alarm panel(s).
Steps to remove this alarm are:
• Temporarily increase the regulator setting at the vacuum insulated
evaporator (VIE) control panel; this should be no more than 4.8 bar (5.0 bar
is the high pressure setting).
• Allow both primary evaporators (where provided) to supply to site.
Version 1.0: 22 March 2020
15
|
Design note: COVID-19 ward for intubated patients
• Estates to regularly monitor the pressures, adjust the regulators as required
and ensure that the evaporators do not ice up excessively. Note: Consult
your liquid oxygen supplier for recommended de-icing procedures.
• Ensure that the VIE compound and any approaches to the compound are
not obstructed by vehicles, etc.
Where medical oxygen cylinder manifolds are used as the primary source
supply:
• Temporarily increase the regulator setting at the manifold control panel; this
should be no more than 4.8 bar (5.0 bar is the high pressure setting),
• Estates to regularly monitor the pressures and adjust the regulators as
required. Estates and pharmacy to regularly monitor cylinder stock and
ensure that there is adequate cylinder storage within the manifold room, or
allocate a space nearby which can be used as a temporary cylinder storage
facility. Note: Ensure that the cylinders are adequately secured and
protected (if possible) from adverse conditions. Consult your medical
oxygen cylinder supplier regarding (temporary) delivery drop-off point(s).
• Ensure that you have adequate cylinder handling trolleys and personnel
suitably trained to move and replenish the cylinders.
• Ensure that the manifold room and any approaches to the area are not
obstructed by vehicles, etc.
Where portable medical oxygen cylinders or oxygen concentrators are to be
provided:
• Estates and pharmacy to regularly monitor cylinder stock and ensure that
there is adequate cylinder storage within the central and local cylinder
stores, or allocate a space nearby which can be used as a temporary
cylinder storage facility. Note: Ensure that the cylinders are adequately
secured and protected (if possible) from adverse conditions. Consult your
medical oxygen cylinder supplier regarding (temporary) delivery drop-off
point(s).
• Ensure that you have adequate cylinder handling trolleys and personnel
suitably trained to move and replenish the cylinders.
Version 1.0: 22 March 2020
16
|
Design note: COVID-19 ward for intubated patients
• Clinical managers to ensure that clinical staff are suitably trained to handle
and operate portable medical oxygen cylinders. Ensure that all the cylinder
stores and any approaches to the designated areas are not obstructed.
Miscellaneous
Where medical oxygen consumption increases, steps must be taken to ensure
the oxygen level (oxygen enrichment) is maintained below 23.5%. Failure to do so
will increase the flammability of the room.
The following should be considered:
• Ensure that the rooms that could be subject to oxygen enrichment are
adequately ventilated by mechanical and/or natural means.
• Where ventilation is deemed inadequate, consider using an alternative
room.
• Regular environmental monitoring of potentially exposed rooms to ensure
oxygen enrichment is controlled.
Medical air
Medical air is mainly supplied via the medical gas pipeline system and
manufactured as required using compressors on the hospital site. In addition,
medical air cylinders are normally used as the independent back-up supply to the
pipeline system, or to supply air to patients where pipelines supplies are not
available.
One of the main uses of medical air in the hospital is driving ventilators and
incubators.
Medical vacuum
Although the medical vacuum system is not directly related to the use or
consumption of medical oxygen, one factor which must be considered is
HTM 02-01’s recommendation against the installation or use of piped medical
vacuum in an ‘infectious diseases unit’. The recommendation is to use portable
suction units which can be removed and sterilised.
Version 1.0: 22 March 2020
17
|
Design note: COVID-19 ward for intubated patients
Although this document’s purpose is to assist with implementing an ‘emergency’
action plan, and the rooms may only be allocated temporarily for COVID-19 infected
patients, there may still be a risk of cross-contamination via an existing piped
medical vacuum system.
Therefore, where a department/room is to be used for COVID-19 patients, the
following should be considered by the estates and infection control
manager/microbiologist:
• If the piped medical vacuum system is present, consider isolating the
medical vacuum terminal unit and sealing it to prevent ingress of harmful
bacteria.
• Where terminal units are individually fed from a dedicated medical vacuum
AVSU, consider isolating the medical vacuum AVSU and inserting a black
spade into the flange immediately from the pipe serving the terminal unit.
By inserting the blank spade, you have effectively removed the effects of
vacuum and normalised the pressure to room pressure. This should
prevent harmful bacteria from entering the pipeline by way of natural
pipeline and terminal unit leakage.
• Proprietary blanking plates that fit into the terminal unit or locally made
covers should be installed to indicate the units are out of service and that
portable units are being used. This said, it may well be an infection control
and prevention (ICP) decision that the main system is used due to overall
decontamination and room-loading issues.
Note: The hospital infection control procedures must be adhered to by all parties at
all times.

Publications approval reference: 001559
10 March 2020
This is the second of a series of regular updates to general practice regarding the
emerging COVID-19 situation. An electronic copy of this letter, and all other relevant
guidance from NHS England and NHS Improvement can be found here:
www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
Dear colleagues
We recognise that preparing for COVID-19 and managing concerns arising is taking
up significant time for you all.
COVID-19 Home Management Service (CHMS)
We have taken urgent measures to commission a COVID-19 Home Management
Service (CHMS) in all parts of England, to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a
week.
Patients with COVID-19 were previously isolated in hospitals, regardless of the
severity of their symptoms. To reduce the burden on primary and secondary care,
patients who are suitable for home management are now being self-isolated in the
community and will be supported through this service.
CHMS will provide urgent primary care services to patients diagnosed with
COVID-19 who are self-isolating in the community. This will include care for
symptoms related to COVID-19 as well as care for other conditions.
The CHMS provider will keep GP practices up to date with any changes in your
patient’s health status and will discharge the patient back into your care after the
patient has subsequently tested negative or after an elapsed time period.
The patient’s care will be provided by the CHMS service provider. In most cases this
will be an existing local out-of-hours service provider but may also be an alternative
provider from a different locality or a digital first provider depending on local
arrangements.
To support CHMS service providers’ ability to look up and contact GP practices with
updates to the health status of their patients receiving CHMS care, we have shared
with all CHMS providers a list of all GP practice email addresses in England. The
emails have been sourced from MHRA Central Alerting System and the use by
CHMS providers will be specific and limited to updating your practice about your
patients.
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
According to PHE, COVID-19 patient categories are as follows:
• Category 1 – Require immediate admission
• Category 2 – Home isolation with active health monitoring
• Category 3 – Home isolation with health advice.
The CHMS will be responsible for providing medical treatment, care and support to
Category 2 and 3 patients, including any home visiting. The service will continue until
the patient is discharged and referred back to their GP.
Patients in Category 2 are at increased risk of complications from COVID-19. These
patients will receive daily communication from a CHMS healthcare professional,
initially by telephone, switching to SMS or other digital communication when feasible
and if appropriate for the individual patient. Category 3 patients will be provided with
advice and invited to contact the CHMS if they develop breathing problems, or other
health concerns. All patients under care of a CHMS provider will be able to contact
the CHMS with any health concerns at any time, 24/7.
There is likely to be a gradual handover of patients to CHMS providers as they come
onstream to provide the service from the North East Ambulance Service. As soon as
the new service is up and running in your area, your CCG will be able to tell you who
will be providing care for patients in your locality.
The CHMS service will be kept under review as the situation develops, with further
updates provided through this communication channel.
Use of NHS111
The current case definition for COVID-19 is on our website:
www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
We have received some reports of cases that do not fulfil this condition being
referred to NHS 111 as possible cases.
People who do not meet the latest case definition for COVID-19 should not be
referred to NHS 111, but directed to general information and advice at
www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/
Patients who do not present as COVID-19, who would otherwise be treated in the
GP, pharmacy, or community settings, should continue to be offered these services
and not unnecessarily referred to NHS 111. Practices may consider how to offer
these services remotely via phone or video.
Online consultations in general practice
We will be supporting CCGs, LMCs and practices to ensure 100% coverage, and
increased use, of online consultations and remote triage in general practice to support
infection control and protect staff and patients. Around 50% of GP practices have an
online consultation system in place. Rapid steps will be taken to:
http://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/
• increase use of existing online consultation systems
• set up new systems where they are not already in place
• enable video consultation capability (d) provide support to implement remote
consultations.
Further advice on online consultations is available here: www.england.nhs.uk/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/online-consultations-summary-tocolkit-for-practices-dec-
2019.pdf
Reviewing current GP services in preparation for any need to release capacity
We are taking steps to review the broad spectrum of current GP services to assess
how additional capacity might be released if required. Similar work is also taking
place across the other primary care professions. Further information will follow in due
course should such steps need to be taken.
Monitoring and annual reviews of vulnerable patients
We recognise that you may be wondering whether to bring in some patients face to
face for annual reviews or regular monitoring. There may be circumstances in which
you judge that the balance of risk and benefit makes it essential that these should be
offered remotely using telephone or digital channels, without any face-to-face
component, rather than cancelling. This allows for important patient care to go ahead
and, at this stage, the NHS will deem these to have fulfilled the requirements of the
Quality Outcomes Framework if coded as usual.
Death certification process
Prior to more detailed guidance being released for the death certification process in
an emergency scenario, please follow these recommendations:
• COVID-19 is an acceptable direct or underlying cause of death for the
purposes
of completing the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death.
• COVID-19 is not a reason on its own to refer a death to a coroner under the
Coroners and Justice Act 2009.
• That COVID-19 is a notifiable disease under the Health Protection
(Notification) Regulations 2010 does not mean referral to a coroner is required
by virtue of its notifiable status.
• Where next of kin/informant are following self-isolation procedures, please
arrange for an alternative informant who has not been in contact with the
patient to collect the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death and deliver to the
registrar for registration purposes.

1. Background
• Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been designated a high consequence
infectious disease (HCID).
• Information on how you can protect yourself can be found here
• Guidance for healthcare providers who have staff with relevant travel or
contact history can be found here.
• COVID-19 for most individuals causes mild to moderate illness, but in
addition may result in pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection, so
patients could potentially present to primary care settings.
• See further information on COVID-19 for healthcare workers here.
The current national approach is to identify, isolate and contain. In England:
• individual patient advice is being provided by NHS 111
• public information and sampling are being managed by Public Health
England (PHE)
• members of the public who may have COVID-19 and are well enough, are
being asked to self-isolate until a diagnosis is confirmed
• for confirmed cases isolation and treatment are being managed by national
specialist treatment centres.
This guidance is applicable in England. Primary care providers operating under
contract to the NHS in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales should refer to
guidance and standard operating procedures (SOPs) produced by the governing
bodies and regulators in their devolved administration.
This guidance is correct at the time of publishing. However, as it is
subject to updates, please use the hyperlinks to confirm the

2. Generic principles for primary
care settings (community pharmacy,
optical, dental and general medical
care providers)
The collaborative endeavours of the primary care workforce in delivering on the
national strategy to identify, isolate and contain COVID-19 are an essential element
of the NHS measures and our national response to the risk presented by COVID-19.
This publication is intended to support primary care teams in the practical
implementation of the PHE evidence-based guidance COVID-19 interim guidance for
primary care. Consistency in adopting the recommended actions will ensure the
safety of our patients, our staff and the population, while maintaining access to
quality healthcare for members of the public in England.
Generic principles for primary care settings and
providers
(See Section 3 for dental practice SOPs - primary care settings.)
• Identify potential cases as soon as possible before clinical care is started:
• Prevent potential transmission of infection to other patients and staff.
• Avoid direct physical contact, including physical examination, and exposure
to respiratory and other secretions.
• Isolate the patient and inform NHS 111:
• If unsure whether an individual poses a risk, the default is to isolate at home,
or in an isolated area in the practice, and call NHS 111 which can seek
clarification with PHE if needed.
• It is preferable for the individual to call NHS 111 on their mobile phone as
this facilitates call back and follow-up contacts if required.
• Practices should designate and prepare a suitable space(s) for
patient/patient group isolation.

• Seek specialist advice: NHS 111 is running a COVID-19 enhanced service
that will be the entry point for all individuals concerned they may meet the case
definition for COVID-19.
• Advise the patient to call NHS 111 for assessment:
– A possible case of coronavirus needs to meet both the clinical symptoms
and have a travel history, including travel to, or transit through (for any
length of time), the identified risk countries or contact with a confirmed
case of coronavirus.
– PHE has confirmed that if a patient is presenting with symptoms after 14
days, they do not meet the case definition and can be handled as
normal.
• Following the NHS 111 assessment, if the patient is calling from an NHS
primary care service provider, NHS 111 will contact the service to advise
them of the next steps and confirm if the caller meets the criteria as a
possible case or not:
– case definition not met –patient to be managed as normal
- NHS 111 will refer the patient back for management in primary care
– case definition met - NHS 111 will liaise with the local healthcare
system, will advise on isolation and will arrange safe transfer of the patient
from the primary care location in accordance with local plans.
• Decontamination Once a possible case has been transferred from the primary
care premises, the room where the patient was placed should not be used, the
room door should remain shut, with windows opened and the air conditioning
switched off, until it has been cleaned with detergent and disinfectant. If a
suspected case spent time in a communal area, for example, a waiting area or
toilet facilities, then these areas should be cleaned with detergent and
disinfectant as soon as practicably possible, unless there has been a blood or
body fluid spill which should be dealt with immediately. Once cleaning and
disinfection have been completed, the area can be put back in use. Follow the
guidance for environmental cleaning following a suspected case; Section 4 of
PHE COVID-19 interim guidance for primary care
• Points to note
• There is no change in best practice protocols and compliance with extant
infection prevention and control requirements.

3. COVID-19: SOP for primary care
dental practice
This publication is designed to explain the actions a dental practice should take in
managing contact with, and presentations of, patients who suspect they may have
COVID-19. Revisions to the SOP will be published in line with any changes in the
risk, as notified by PHE.
Practices are to note that for security and information governance nhs.net2 will be
the primary means for the cascade of information, links to resources, guidance and
notification of amendments/revisions and incident notification.
Patient contact
Most patients presenting in primary dental care settings are unlikely to have
COVID-19. If they have coughs, colds or flu-like symptoms but no relevant
(COVID-19) travel or contact history, then management of their dental care should
proceed in line with best practice and routine management of the cross-infection
risks to staff/patients.
Practice staff are to be made aware of this SOP, the current guidance and case
definitions and to be able to carry out an initial risk assessment of patient’s
travel/contact history with regards COVID-19.
• A possible case of COVID-19 needs to meet both the clinical symptoms
AND have a travel history, including travel to, or transit through (for any
length of time), the identified risk countries OR contact with a confirmed
case of coronavirus.
• If a patient is presenting with symptoms after 14 days, they do not meet the
case definition and can be handled as normal.
2 For practices that have yet to set up an nhs.net account you should go to the NHS Registration
website where you will be guided through the short process.

Patient contact by telephone
For patients contacting the practice by telephone, an accurate travel history is key to
identifying risk of COVID-19 cases.
The gov.uk site should be checked at the beginning of the day to ascertain the most
up-to-date country travel information.
If the patient answers Yes to any of the following questions:
• Have you been to any of the following Category 1 areas in the last 14 days
(even if you do not have symptoms)?
• Have you travelled to any of the following Category 2 areas in the last 14 days
and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breath (even if it's mild)?
• Have you been in close contact with someone with confirmed coronavirus?
Ask a secondary question:
• Have you been advised to self-isolate?
For patients in self-isolation
• Patients who are self-isolating for COVID-19 should not be brought into the
practice premises. Patients should contact NHS 111 for further assessment
and referral, as necessary, to a designated receiving service if the
requirement for care is an emergency.
• Defer any appointments for elective care and reinforce self-isolation advice.
• Patients in self-isolation may ring the practice seeking advice on urgent
dental care, if advice cannot be provided over the telephone and treatment is
required please ask the patient to call NHS 111:
– NHS 111 will triage and assess options for referral to a designated
receiving unit for any COVID-19 urgent dental care cases, as necessary.
For patients not in self-isolation
Advise patient to contact NHS 111 and seek advice on their symptoms and recent
travel/contact history.

• Ask patient to provide NHS 111 with contact details for the practice.
• An NHS 111 clinician will contact the practice after their assessment to
confirm if case definition not met, patient to be accepted back to practice for
care as usual.
Patients presenting at the practice
On arrival
Make sure patient information posters for NHS settings are displayed so they can be
seen before patients enter the premises. Patient information should be displayed at
reception, by any patient touch screen booking-in, waiting areas and at patient
access points to clinical areas.
Patients with a relevant travel history and meeting the COVID-19 case definition
should be identified when they book in at reception.
Reception staff need to be aware of the travel advice on Gov.uk and should ask
patients on arrival at the practice:
• Have you been to any of the following Category 1 areas in the last 14 days
(even if you do not have symptoms)?
• Have you travelled to any of the following Category 2 areas in the last 14
days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breath (even if it's
mild)?
• Have you been in close contact with someone with confirmed coronavirus?
• Have you been asked to self-isolate?
In the event that someone presents to the practice with suspected COVID-19 and
answers Yes to any of the questions above:
• The default is to advise the patient to return home immediately and call NHS
111.
• A patient who does not feel well enough or is unwilling to return home
should be immediately isolated in a room or area away from other patients
and staff and NHS 111 called.
• Invite the patient (and any accompanying family/representative) into the
designated isolation space and advise others not to enter the area/room to

minimise the risk of spreading infection. Advise the patient to contact NHS
111 from the designated isolation area/room:
– The patient will need to state where they are calling from and provide
contact details for the practice.
– While the practice may phone NHS 111 on behalf of the patient, NHS 111
may need to ring the patient back, so the best option is to advise the
patient, if they have one, to use their own mobile phone.
• The NHS 111 clinician will contact the practice after their assessment to
advise on whether the patient meets the case definition and provide advice
on next steps, which may be:
– case definition not met and routine care in practice may be resumed
– case definition met ‒ maintain isolation in current location pending
transfer to defined destination.
While waiting for advice from NHS 111, establish a routine for regular
communication with the patient/patient group. This may necessitate contact via
remote means or simply a knock and conversation through the closed door.
If healthcare professionals need to enter the room to provide emergency care or
support the 999 assessment, healthcare professionals should wear personal
protective equipment (PPE) in line with standard infection control precautions,
(disposable gloves, disposable apron and fluid resistant surgical mask (FRSM)) and
keep exposure to a minimum. All PPE should be disposed of as clinical waste. See
PHE COVID-19 interim guidance for primary care
If the patient becomes critically ill and requires an urgent ambulance transfer to a
hospital the practice should contact 999 and inform the ambulance call handler of
COVID-19 concerns. The patient should be isolated as soon as possible.

Note A disposable fluid-resistant face mask (FRSM) is
worn over the nose and mouth to protect the mucous
membranes of the wearer’s nose and mouth from
splashes and infectious droplets and also to protect
patients.
When recommended for infection control
purposes a 'surgical face mask' typically denotes a fluid-
resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask.

During consultation/treatment
If COVID-19 is considered possible when an appointment is already in progress,
assess a suitable and safe point to bring any treatment to a close, withdraw from the
room, close the door and wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.
Advise the patient to contact NHS 111 from the isolated consulting room.
While the practice may phone NHS 111 on behalf of the patient, NHS 111 may need
to ring the patient back, so the best option is to advise the patient, if they have one to
use their own mobile phone.
NHS 111 clinicians will assess the case and advise on next steps, including:
• Case definition not met and routine care in practice may be resumed
• Case definition met - Maintain isolation in current location pending transfer to
defined destination.
• If the patient is critically ill or requires emergency medical care, an
ambulance should be requested, and the 999-call handler informed of
COVID-19 risk.
• If a healthcare professional is required to enter the room to offer assistance
or support the 999 assessment, they should wear disposable gloves,
disposable aprons and fluid-resistant surgical face masks. See PHE COVID-
19 interim guidance for primary care

During a domiciliary visit
If suspected COVID-19 is identified before a domiciliary, patients should be advised
to contact NHS 111 for further assessment.
If suspected COVID-19 is identified during a domiciliary visit, staff should ensure
they have the patient’s (or carer’s) telephone number. Staff should then withdraw
from the room, close the door and wash hands thoroughly with soap and water.
Further communication should be via telephone. The patient (or carer) should then
call NHS 111 for further assessment.
If suspected COVID-19 is identified during a care home visit, in addition to the
protocols described, please also inform the local Health Protection Team to discuss
possible case contacts, decontamination processes and any further action required.

4. Post-transfer actions
Once a possible case has been transferred from the practice premises, unless
directed otherwise:
• The room or isolation area where the patient was placed should not be used,
the room door should remain shut, area cordoned off, with windows opened
and the air conditioning switched off, until it has been cleaned with detergent
and disinfectant.
• If a suspected case spent time in a communal area, for example, a waiting
area or toilet facilities, then these areas should be cleaned with detergent
and disinfectant as soon as practicably possible, unless there has been a
blood or body fluid spill which should be dealt with immediately.
• Details of how to decontaminate are detailed in PHE COVID-19 interim
guidance for primary care.
• Once cleaning and disinfection have been completed, the area can be put
back in use.
• The usual PPE equipment and protocols apply when cleaning and
disinfecting; HAZMAT equipment is not required. Disposable gloves and
disposable aprons should be available in the practice as part of the routine
cleaning, disinfection and decontamination PPE. Staff should follow the
usual cleaning routine and COSH Guidance .
• All waste from suspected contaminated areas should be removed from the
room and quarantined until patient test results are known (this may take 48
hours); if the patient is confirmed to have COVID-19 further advice should be
sought from the local health protection team. Details of your local health
protection team can be found at www.gov.uk/health-protection-team
• Remove and discard PPE as clinical waste.
• It is the responsibility of the primary care provider to supply cleaning
materials and PPE for staff and to ensure their staff are appropriately
trained, have access to equipment and have arrangements in place for
disposal of clinical waste.
• Practice staff that have been in contact with suspected cases are not
required to self-isolate unless directed otherwise by the health protection
team.

5. Preparation guidance
To underpin practice resilience and continuity of service whilst protecting your
patients, practice staff and the public; the following practical steps are
recommended:
Appoint a COVID-19 lead for the in-practice co-ordination of activities, training,
preparation and implementation of this SOP and any subsequent revisions to
guidance.
It is recommended that the practice establishes a daily routine updating practice staff
with respect to travel advice on gov.uk:
• Category 1 areas
• Category 2 areas
Communication and information
Practices are to ensure that they have designated a practice nhs.net account for the
timely receipt of COVID-19 information.
Practices should confirm the account details
with their Regional commissioning team.
• For practices that have yet to set up an nhs.net account you should go to the
NHS Registration Website where you will be guided through the short
process.
COVD-19 information will be sent directly to your premises specific NHS Mail
account by the NHS England and NHS Improvement Regional Team
• Please ensure this account is closely monitored for new information.
Practices should ensure auto forward for e-mails to an alternative nhs.net
account and designated deputy in the event of user absence.
The Central Alerting System (CAS) will continue to be used to communicate urgent
updates. Practices are reminded to ensure they have followed registration guidance
provided by MHRA to use a generic email, as such accounts can be used by more
than one person to maintain continuity of service at times when an individual is

• Identify at least one suitable space/room in the practice for patient/patient
group isolation.
–
If no suitable isolation room, identify an isolated area within the practice
that can be cordoned off for the use of the patient/patient group, which
maintains a 2-metre space from other patients and staff.
– De-clutter and removal of non-essential furnishings and items: this will
assist if decontamination is required post-patient transfer.
– If possible, retain a telephone in the room/space for patient contact with
NHS 111 and for maintaining contact with patient during period of
isolation.
– Place a card/sign in the isolation room/area with practice contact details,
e-mail, telephone numbers, practice location and post code, include the
name of the lead clinician in attendance (this information is to be available
to the patient when they contact NHS 111).
• All staff are briefed on the potential use of the room/area and actions
required in the event that it is necessary to vacate room/area at short notice.
• Identify toilet facilities that will be designated for the sole use of patients
while in isolation.
• Prepare appropriate space/room signage to be used if the space/room is
occupied and the same for the toilet facilities.
• Prepare a patient ‘support pack’ (to be held in reserve) that may include,
items such as bottled water, disposable cups/cutlery, disposable tissues,
clinical waste bag, fluid-resistant surgical mask.
• Review the isolation space/area and consider the options for carrying out
regular checks on the general welfare of the isolated patient/patient group.
This may be simply a knock and conversation through the closed door or
could be verbal and/or visual contact via remote means, eg telephone,
Skype/FaceTime, practice intercom, baby monitor.

Practice preparation for incident management
Practices may wish to draw on their existing protocols for dealing with medical
emergencies in practice. The incident management principles are the same:
• Develop and rehearse the practice’s COVID-19 triage protocols and isolation
procedures
– agree practice approach for each stage of the potential scenarios
– confirm role and responsibilities for each member of staff
– appoint an incident manager
– confirm lead for discussions with patients/NHS111
– prepare an aide memoire for staff (using guidance in Section 3)
– rehearse practice response
• Review the practice protocols for decontamination from patients who have
potentially infectious conditions. These protocols, PPE, training and
materials are extant contractual and regulatory requirements.3,4
– Review and refresh knowledge and application of HTM 01-05
decontamination protocols, equipment and PPE.
• Anticipate impacts on practice schedule
– Practices are advised to consider the likelihood (which is currently low)
and the risk of disruption to the appointments scheduled for the day.
• Review the practice’s business continuity plan.
• Domiciliary ‒ ensure that ‘home visit’ bags have necessary additional PPE
and clinical waste bags in case a patient with suspected coronavirus is
identified on a home visit.

21 March 2020
Dear Colleague,
CARING FOR PEOPLE AT HIGHEST RISK DURING COVID-19 INCIDENT
We are writing to update you on the latest advice that will be sent to all patients who
are considered to be at highest risk of severe illness that would require
hospitalisation from coronavirus (COVID-19).
A letter will be sent to these patients
asking them to stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact for at
least twelve weeks.
This builds on existing national guidance, including:
• https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/
• https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/
• https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus
This letter will be sent to patients who fall into one of the following groups (Further
detail on the Groups can be found at Annex 1 to the CMO letter this accompanies).
List of diseases and conditions considered to be very high risk (Group 1):
1. Solid organ transplant recipients
2. People with specific cancers
• People with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radical
radiotherapy for lung cancer
• People with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia,
lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment
• People having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for
cancer
• People having other targeted cancer treatments which can affect the immune
system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors.
• People who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last 6
months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs.
3. People with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic fibrosis, severe
asthma and severe COPD
4. People with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that significantly
increase the risk of infections (such as SCID, homozygous sickle cell disease)
5. People on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly increase risk of
infection
6. People who are pregnant with significant heart disease, congenital or acquired
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/
https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/
https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus
2
A copy of the letter sent to patients can be found in Annex 3. The patients of your
practice that have been contacted can be identified through an “at high risk” indicator
code that has been applied to each patient record by your clinical system supplier.
Your supplier will inform you of the code they have used, which should be treated as
temporary until a definitive list of COVID-19 ‘at risk’ SNOMED codes is released.
Your GP System supplier will also provide a report that will list those patients that
have been centrally identified as being at high risk.
You should have this by 23
March. We ask that you review this report for accuracy and, where any of these
patients have dementia, a learning disability or autism, that you provide appropriate
additional support to them to ensure they continue receiving access to care.
We have taken a two-pronged approach to identification of people on
immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly increase the risk of infection
(category 5). All patients on the following medications have been centrally identified
and will be contacted via the letter:
• Azathioprine
• Mycophenolate (both types)
• Cyclosporin
• Sirolimus
• Tacrolimus
Central datasets are not sophisticated enough to identify all categories of patients
who should be included in the vulnerable groups list. We are grateful for the help of
colleagues in the Medical Royal Colleges and societies who are cascading guidance
to secondary care to help them identify other high risk patients from their caseload.
We appreciate this is a complex task requiring difficult judgements, and we ask for
your help, as the GP central to the care of these patients, in achieving this. We are
writing to UK secondary care colleagues in two groups, (2 and 3):
Group 2
The Royal College of Physicians and associated medical societies will contact six
specialties1 with very specific guidance about identification of patients on
immunosuppression therapies who are among the very highest risk. We are unable
to adequately identify this group from central datasets which, for example, do not
reliably code patients taking biologics. We will ask specialists to identify such
patients from their caseload and contact the patients with a copy of the standard
letter and write to you with their names.
1 Dermatology, Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Neurology, Respiratory, Renal and
Rheumatology
3
Group 3
The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges will cascade more general guidance about
identifying other high risk groups across specialties. We will ask the wider group of
specialists to identify only those that they would consider to be at the very highest
risk, bearing in mind the severity and unpleasant nature of the intervention that will
be proposed for this group. We will also ask specialists to contact identified patients
with a copy of the standard letter and write to you with their names.
You may know of other patients (Group 4) who you would consider to be at very high
risk from infection. The RCGP will shortly publish guidance to support GPs
identifying additional high risk patients. The guidance will also support GPs to have
shared decision-making conversations with all high risk patients as needed, and help
GPs to understand what health needs these groups may have.
We ask that, if you choose to identify additional individuals you consider to be at
highest risk of severe outcomes, that you proactively contact this group of patients to
discuss your recommendation with them. There may be patients not in these
categories who contact you to say that they wish to be included in the group to be
shielded by the restrictive, stringent measures, and asking for a fit note to cover the
period of isolation. We ask you to use your professional judgement and consider the
RCGP guidance when advising this group.
The recommendation for shielding the very high-risk group is just that, and we ask
that your discussion with patients reflect this. Some patients may decide, on
weighing up the risks, that they would prefer not to follow the restrictive, stringent
measures. We ask that you help your patients to work through this if they wish to.
We also suggest that anybody with a terminal diagnosis who is thought to be in their
last 6 months of life should be excluded from this group (unless they wish to be
included), to allow them to maintain contact with their loved ones during the last
phase of their illness.
Please note this process is covered by your CNSGP arrangements in the usual way.
In addition, we ask that you take the action listed below with respect to patients in
your practice who are identified for the vulnerable group from any of the above
routes.
These discussions should align with the guidance set out in the letter we sent you on
19 March and upcoming RCGP guidance on supporting high risk patients.
1. Ongoing care arrangements
Please immediately review any ongoing care arrangements that you have with these
highest risk patients.
Wherever possible, patient contact, triage and treatment should be delivered via
phone, email or online. However, if you decide that the patient needs to be seen in
person, please arrange for your practice to contact them to organise a visit to the
surgery, a hub or their home as appropriate.
4
NHS Trusts have also been asked to review ongoing care arrangements and will
contact patients directly to make adjustments to hospital care and treatment as
needed.
2. Support with medicine supplies:
Patients have been informed that repeat prescription durations will not change during
this incident, and that patients will need to ensure that their medication can be
collected or delivered to them directly.
Repeatable prescriptions can be valid for a
year, but each repeat should be for no longer than the patient has now. For example,
if the patient has prescriptions for a 28 day supply now then the repeat dispensing
should be set up as 12 x 28 days’ supply.
Patients who currently have their medication delivered, by a chosen person or by a
pharmacy, should continue to do so.
Patients who need regular medicine, but have not yet set up online ordering and
delivery will need to be supported to do so.
We ask that you arrange that suitable
patients be put on electronic repeat dispensing as soon as possible in line with our
letter of 5 March.
Patients have been asked to arrange their own delivery or collection of their
prescriptions through a nominated person, online delivery or delivery from a
community pharmacy.
If they struggle to do this, we ask that your practice (via a
social prescriber) helps set up an appropriate arrangement.
3. Support with daily living
We have encouraged patients to discuss their daily needs with their carers, friends,
families and local voluntary groups.
This includes support for physical needs such
as food and shopping deliveries, as well as their mental health needs.
If patients contact you asking for help, we suggest that your social prescribing link
worker (or equivalent), where available, helps them to arrange additional support
and/or link them to local voluntary groups. Where not currently available, local
government and other voluntary sector organisations will also be able to arrange
support.
NHS England and NHS Improvement are also setting up a new volunteering portal
that they can use to access support for daily tasks.
This will be available from
Tuesday 24 March.
Given capacity, only the highest risk patients should be directed
to this service.
Patients who do not have family or friends that can help, can also be directed to
www.gov.uk/coronavirus-extremely-vulnerable to register for additional support with
daily living tasks such as shopping and social care.
Patients have been told that the letter they have received can be used as evidence
for their employer, to show that they cannot work outside the home.

Urgent medical attention
All patients who display symptoms of COVID-19, have been asked to contact the
NHS 111 online coronavirus service, or call NHS 111 if they do not have access to
the internet.
However, if patients have an urgent medical question relating to their pre-existing
condition, we have asked that they contact you, or their specialist consultant,
directly.
4. Looking after your own health
It is important that you look after your and your practice staff’s own health and
wellbeing at this time.
If, at any point, you think you or a member of your team have developed symptoms
of COVID-19, such as a new, continuous cough and/or high temperature (above
37.8), seek clinical advice using the NHS 111 online coronavirus service
(https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/) or, if you do not have access to the internet, call NHS
111.
You can also access support for managing your own mental health from the free,
confidential NHS Practitioner Health Service (https://www.practitionerhealth.nhs.uk/).
Please accept our sincere thanks for your help, patience and support at this
challenging time.
Yours sincerely

（COVID-19）感染家庭的指南
2020 年 3 月 16 日更新
症状
冠状病毒（COVID-19）的最常见症状是最近发作：
 新的持续咳嗽和/或
 发烧
对于大多数人来说，冠状病毒（COVID-19）将是一种轻度疾病。
主要讯息
 如果您独自居住并且有冠状病毒疾病（COVID-19）的症状，无论症状有多
轻微，请从症状出现后保持在家呆7 天。（有关更多信息，请参见下面的
结束隔离章节）
 如果您与他人一起居住，并且您或其中有人患有冠状病毒症状，则所有家
庭成员均必须呆在家里且不得离家 14 天。这一 14 天的期限从家里第一
个人生病的那一天开始
 居住在一个家庭中的人可能会相互感染或已经被感染。在家呆 14 天将大
大减少家庭可能传染给社区其他人的总感染量
 对于开始出现症状的家庭中的任何人，他们都需要从出现症状开始在家里
呆 7 天，而无论他们当时处于最初 14 天隔离期的哪一天。（有关更多信
息，请参见下面的结束隔离章节）
 如果可以的话，请将任何弱势群体人员（例如老人和具有基础健康状况的
人）转出您的家，在家庭隔离期间与朋友或家人呆在一起
 如果您不能将弱势群体人员转出家，请尽可能远离他们
 如果您有冠状病毒症状：
 不要前往全科医生诊所、药房或医院
 您无需联系 111 告诉他们您呆在家里
 如果您呆在家里，则无需进行冠状病毒检测
 提前计划并寻求其他人的帮助，以确保您可以成功呆在家里，并考虑可以
为家庭中的弱势群体人员做些什么

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#ending-isolation
 请您的雇主、朋友和家人帮助您获得呆在家中需要的东西
 勤洗手，每次使用肥皂和水清洗 20 秒钟，或使用洗手液
 如果您觉得自己在家里无法应对症状，或者病情恶化，或者 7 天后症状没
有好转，请使用 NHS 111 在线冠状病毒服务。如果您无法上网，请致电
NHS 111。对于医疗急救，请致电 999
本指南适用于谁
该建议适用于：
 有可能因冠状病毒引起的症状并且不需要医院治疗的人，他们必须呆在家
里直到恢复健康
 居住在家庭中显示可能因冠状病毒引起的症状的人
现在可以帮助您准备的事项
为与您同住的人或家人制定计划
您现在可以做的最好的事情是计划如何适应您的日常活动以及家庭中其他人的日常活
动，以便能够遵守该建议。您可以进行准备的一些方法包括：
 与您的邻居和家人交谈，并交换家庭联系电话号码
 考虑并为您的家庭中被认为是弱势群体的人员制定计划
 制定一份包含邻居、学校、单位、药店、NHS 111 电话号码的联系人名单
 尽可能设置在线购物账户
如果我们认为自己患有冠状病毒症状，是否将对我的家人进行检测？
如果您呆在家里，则无需进行冠状病毒检测。
为什么呆在家里很重要
患有可能因冠状病毒引起的症状的人及其家庭成员呆在家里非常重要。呆在家
里将有助于控制该病毒向朋友、更广泛的社区尤其是最弱势群体的传播。
有症状并独自居住的人应在症状发作后保持呆在家里 7 天（请参阅下面的结
束自我隔离）。这将减少您感染其他人的风险。
如果您与他人一起居住，并且您或其中有人患有因冠状病毒引起的症状，则所
有家庭成员均必须呆在家里且不得离家 14 天（参阅下面的结束自我隔离）。
如果可能的话，除了锻炼以外，您甚至不应该外出购买食物或其他必需品，但
如果是那样，请与他人保持安全距离。这一 14 天的期限从家里第一个人生病
的那一天开始

如果不可能的话，那么当您离开家中获得补给品时，您应该尽量限制您的社交
联系。
居住在一个家庭中的人可能会相互感染或已经被感染。在家呆 14 天将大大减
少家庭可能传染给社区其他人的总感染量。
呆在家里可能会很困难且令人沮丧，但是您可以做一些事情来帮助使它变得轻
松些。这包括：
 提前计划，考虑一下您需要什么才能在家里呆上整整 7 天或 14 天
 与您的雇主、朋友和家人交谈，寻求他们的帮助，以获取您能够呆在家里
所需的东西
 考虑并计划在此期间您将如何获得食物和其它用品（例如药品）
 请朋友或家人放下您需要的物品或在线订购补给品，但请确保这些物品被
放在您的家外，以供您收集
 确保您通过电话或社交媒体与朋友和家人保持联系
 考虑一下您呆在家里期间可以做的事情。成功在家里呆过一段时间的人曾
经用做饭、读书、在线学习和看电影等活动打发时间
 许多人发现为整整 14 天进行计划（例如在临时日历上）会有所帮助。您
还可能会发现提前计划好您的工作会有帮助，例如，如果家中某人感到更
糟，例如呼吸困难
 当您感觉好些时，请记住体育锻炼对您的健康有益。寻找可以帮助您在家
中进行低强度锻炼的在线班级或课程
当您呆在家里时，请确保做以下事情
留在家里
您和所有家庭成员应呆在家里。不要去上班、上学或公共场所，不要使用公共
交通工具或出租车。
如果可能的话，除了锻炼以外，您甚至不应该外出购买食物或其他必需品，但
如果是那样，请与他人保持安全距离。这一 14 天的期限从家里第一个人生病
的那一天开始
如果您需要帮助购买日用品、其它物品或购买药品或遛狗，则需要请朋友或亲
戚帮忙。或者，您可以通过电话或在线订购药品。您也可以在线进行购物。如
果您在线订购，请确保告知送货司机将物品留在门外，以供收集。送货司机不
应进入您的家中。
如果您是一名员工且因冠状病毒无法上班，请参阅本工作和养老金部的指南，
以了解有关您可以使用的支持的信息。
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-employees
如果您与孩子们一起居住
尽您所能继续遵守此建议，但是，我们知道并非所有这些措施都是可行的。
到目前为止，我们看到的是冠状病毒患儿受到的影响似乎较轻。不过，请务必
尽您所能遵守本指南。
如果您有弱势群体人员与您同住
尽可能减少任何弱势家庭成员在共用空间（如厨房、浴室和起居区）中度过的
时间，并确保共用空间通风良好。
力求与弱势群体人员保持 2 米（3 步）的距离，并鼓励他们分床睡。如果可
以，他们应该使用与其他家庭成员分开的浴室。确保他们使用与家庭中其他成
员分开的毛巾，各自用于在洗澡或淋浴后擦干身体和用于手部卫生的目的。
如果您确实与弱势群体人员共用卫生间和浴室，则重要的一点是在每次使用时
都要进行清洁（例如擦拭您接触过的表面）。另一项提示是考虑起草一个洗澡
轮次表，让弱势群体人员首先使用该设施。
如果您与弱势群体人员共用厨房，请避免在他们在场时使用。
如果可以的话，他们应该把饭菜带回他们的房间去吃。如果有的话，请用洗碗
机清洗和干燥家人用过的陶器和餐具。如果无法做到这一点，请用通常的洗涤
液和温水洗涤并彻底干燥。如果弱势群体人员正在使用自己的餐具，请记住使
用单独的抹布把他们的餐具擦干。
我们知道，有些人很难在家里与其他人分开。您应尽您所能遵守此指南，并且
家庭中的每一位成员都应勤洗手，避免触摸脸部并清洁经常触摸的表面。
如果您是在感染时母乳喂养
目前尚无证据表明该病毒可通过母乳传播。感染可以通过与传播给与您密切接
触的任何人相同的方式传播给婴儿。目前的证据表明，冠状病毒患儿的症状比
成年人轻得多。母乳喂养的好处超过通过母乳或密切接触传播病毒的任何潜在
风险；但是，这是一种个人决定，可以通过电话与您的助产士、健康访问员客
或全科医生讨论。
如果您或家人正在喂配方奶或速溶牛奶，则应在每次使用前仔细对设备进行消
毒。请勿与他人共用奶瓶或吸奶器。
您可以在皇家妇产科医师学院的网站上查阅更多信息。
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/
废物的清理和处置
清理时，应使用普通的家用产品，例如洗涤剂和漂白剂，因为它们对于清除表
面的病毒非常有效。清洁经常触摸的表面，例如门把手、扶手、遥控器和台
面。如果您的家里有年长或弱势群体人员，这一点尤其重要。
可以将个人垃圾（例如用过的纸巾）和一次性清洁布安全地存放在一次性垃圾
袋中。这些袋子应放在另一个袋子中，系紧并与其它垃圾分开存放。这应在放
置到通常的家庭外面垃圾箱中之前放置至少 72 小时。
其它家庭垃圾可以照常处置。
洗衣
为了最大程度地减少通过空气传播病毒的可能性，请勿摇动脏衣服。
请按照制造商的说明正确地洗涤衣物。所有脏衣服都可以以相同的洗衣量进行
洗涤。
如果您没有洗衣机，请在 7 天（对于个人隔离）或 14 天（对于家庭）隔离
期结束后再等待 72 个小时，然后才能将衣物送至公共自助洗衣店。
您可以做些什么来帮助自己更快地恢复健康
喝水以保持身体水分；您白天应该多喝水，这样尿液（尿）的颜色会变淡。您
可以使用非处方药（例如扑热息痛）来缓解某些症状。请根据包装或标签上的
说明使用，并且不要超过建议剂量。
如果您或您的家人需要就医
如果您的疾病或任何家庭成员的疾病在恶化，请立即就医。如果不是急诊，请
通过 111.nhs.uk 联系 NHS 111 在线。如果无法上网，则应致电 NHS 111。
如果是急诊并且需要叫救护车，请拨打 999，并告知接线员或话务员您或您的
亲戚有冠状病毒症状。
在您和家人呆在家里时，通常应该取消所有常规的医疗和牙科预约。如果您担
心或被要求在家庭隔离期间亲自出面，请首先与您的医疗联系人（例如您的全
科医生、当地医院或门诊服务）使用他们提供的电话号码进行讨论。如果您的

勤洗手
https://111.nhs.uk/
每天通过使用肥皂和水清洗 20 秒钟或使用洗手液勤洗手。这将有助于保护您
和与您一起居住的人。该步骤是降低将感染传染给他人风险的最有效方法之
一。
咳嗽和打喷嚏时请遮挡
咳嗽或打喷嚏时，用一次性纸巾遮住口鼻。如果您没有随手可用的纸巾，请将
喷嚏打到肘部弯曲处，而不要打入您的手中。
如果您有照护者，则在您打喷嚏或咳嗽后，他们应使用一次性纸巾擦掉任何粘
液或痰液。然后，他们应该用肥皂和水洗手。
将纸巾放入一次性垃圾袋中，然后立即用肥皂和水清洗手或使用洗手液。
口罩
我们不建议将口罩用作防止感染扩散的有效手段。口罩在诸如医院等临床环境
中起着重要作用，但是很少有证据表明在这些环境之外使用它们会带来益处。
不要接待访客
请勿邀请或允许社交访客（例如其他朋友和家人）进入您的家中。如果您想与
家庭成员以外的人交谈，请使用电话或社交媒体。
如果您或家庭成员在家中接受基本护理，则照护者应继续到访。照护者将被提
供口罩和手套，以减少您传染感染的风险。
如果家里有宠物
目前，没有证据表明伴侣动物/宠物（如狗和猫）可以被冠状病毒感染。
居家照顾您的健康
我们知道，对于某些人来说，长时间呆在家里会很困难、沮丧和孤独，您或其
他家庭成员可能会感到情绪低落。如果您没有够大的空间或无法去花园，这可
能会特别具有挑战性。
重要的是要记住照顾好自己的心情和身体，并在需要时获得支持。通过电话或
社交媒体与家人和朋友保持联系。另外也有可以提供帮助的支持资源和信息，
例如每个人的心理健康都重要网站。
考虑一下您呆在家里期间可以做的事情。不介意在家里呆过一周的人曾经用做
饭、读书、在线学习和看电影等活动打发时间。如果感觉良好，您可以在家中
或花园里进行低强度锻炼。
https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/
许多人发现提醒自己为什么他们正在做的事情如此重要很有帮助。希望您的家
人不会遭受类似流感的症状。但是有些人会受到冠状病毒的严重影响，特别是
老年人和有某些医疗状况的人。通过呆在家里，您可以保护他人的生命，并确
保 NHS 不被累垮。
结束自我隔离和家庭隔离
如果您有症状，则可以在 7 天后结束自我隔离。
这一 7 天的期限从您最初生病的那一天开始
如果与他人住在一起，则所有健康的家庭成员都可以在 14 天后结束家庭隔
离。这一 14 天的期限从第一个人生病的那一天开始。冠状病毒的潜伏期为十
四天； 14 天后保持健康的人不太可能具有传染性。
7 天后，如果第一个生病的人感觉好些并且不再发烧，则可以恢复正常的生
活。如果在 14 天的家庭隔离期间任何其他家庭成员感到不适，则应遵守相同
的建议 - 即在症状出现 7 天后，如果感觉好转且不再发烧，他们也可以返回
他们正常的日常活动。
如果家庭成员在 14 天家庭隔离期的后期（例如在第 13 天或第 14 天）出现
冠状病毒症状，则无需延长家庭隔离期，但是有新症状的人必须呆在家里 7
天。
14 天的家庭隔离期将大大减少其余家庭成员可能继续传播的感染总量，并且
无需为整个家庭重新开始 14 天的隔离期。这将提供高水平的社区保护。进一
步隔离该家庭的成员将几乎没有提供额外的社区保护。
在 14 天的期限结束时，任何没有感到身体不适的家庭成员都可以解除家庭隔
离。
如果家庭中的任何患者没有任何改善的迹象并且尚未就医，则应联系 NHS 111
在线。如果您的家里无法上网，则应致电 NHS 111。
尽管已消除冠状病毒感染，但某些人的咳嗽可能会持续数周。仅持续咳嗽并不
意味着某人必须继续自我隔离 7 天以上。

NHS England and NHS Improvement
Publications approval reference: 001559
19 March 2020
This is the third of a series of regular updates to general practice regarding the
emerging COVID-19 situation. An electronic copy of this letter, and all other relevant
guidance from NHS England and NHS Improvement can be found here:
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
Dear GPs and their commissioners,
NEXT STEPS ON GENERAL PRACTICE RESPONSE TO COVID 19
We recognise the intense pressure that general practice is under right now as the
pandemic increases rapidly.
On 17 March you received Next Steps on the NHS response to COVID 19:
www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/publication/next-steps-on-nhs-response-to-covid-
19-letter-from-simon-stevens-and-amanda-pritchard/
This letter now describes the service delivery consequences for general practice and
further steps we are taking nationally to manage the workload consequences and
ensure that income can be protected if other routine work has to be substituted.
Supporting staff to stay safe and well at work is a critical immediate priority ,
including through expansion of testing, and supply of PPE. An issue of protective kit
commenced on 9 March 2020. If any general practice has concerns around th e kit,
please contact our National Supply Disruption line on 0800 915 9964 or email
supplydisruptionservice@nhsbsa.nhs.uk who will be available to help, Monday to
Friday 08:00-18:00.
1. Advice and guidance on coronavirus
Up-to-date advice from Public Health England, including the latest case definition,
can be found here and our latest guidance can be found here.
Anyone who is unwell should go to NHS111 online first for advice, rather than
approaching their GP practice. If a case comes to the surgery or extended hours
hub:
• If the patient is WELL then:
- they should go home immediately and self-isolate
- use nhs.uk/coronavirus for advice and guidance.
• If the patient is UNWELL then:
o use PPE as per current PHE guidance for possible cases
o isolate the patient
o if acutely unwell treat as appropriate
o if not then ask them to use NHS 111 online or ring NHS 111 from home
or the isolation room
o decontaminate as per the standard operating procedure (SOP).

https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
2. Service implications and priorities
Responding to COVID-19 is already necessitating major immediate changes to how
general practice works.
Right now, all practices and their commissioners are asked to focus on six urgent
priorities:
1. Move to a total triage system (whether by phone or online). This does not
mean not advising/treating patients for other health issues, where there is
clinical need, or unilateral closing of practices doors, rather ensuring that
patients are appropriately triaged to the right health professional setting. The
upsurge in telephone calls to general practice means that providing a reliable
and timely response for patients has already become a vital operational
priority.
2. Agree locally with your CCG which practice premises and teams should
be used to manage essential face-to-face services.
3. Undertake all care that can be done remotely via appropriate channels,
guided by your clinical judgement. We ask you to read the guidance note at
annex A.
4. Prepare for the significant increase in home visiting as a result of social
distancing, home isolation and the need to discharge all patients who do not
need to be in hospital
5. Prioritise support for particular groups of patients at high risk. Next
week the NHS will be writing directly to all patients in this category, and you
will receive further advice shortly
6. Help staff to stay safe and at work, building cross-practice resilience
across primary care networks, and confirming business continuity plans.
To reduce the risk of respiratory disease, protect those most vulnerable and reduce
pressure on health services, please can you also ensure that you have ordered
sufficient stock of the recommended adult flu vaccines for 2020/21* to meet your
local needs before the 31st March 2020. In summary these are:
• For over-65s aTIV
• For under-65s at risk, including pregnancy women either QIVc or QIVe.
* www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NHS-England-JCVI-advce-and-
NHS-reimbursement-flu-vaccine-2020-21.pdf
3. Arrangements to free up capacity and protect income
We will seek to do all we can to support practices to manage inevitable increases in
workload at this extremely difficult time.
Patients will be clearly advised to visit
http://nhs.uk/coronavirus in the first instance and not to visit their practice, if they
have relevant symptoms.
The key principle is that we free up practice capacity to prioritise workload to both
prepare for and manage the COVID-19 outbreak. All routine CQC inspections have
http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NHS-England-JCVI-advce-and-NHS-reimbursement-flu-vaccine-2020-21.pdf
http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NHS-England-JCVI-advce-and-NHS-reimbursement-flu-vaccine-2020-21.pdf
been cancelled and advice is being issued on suspension of appraisal and
revalidation activities.
We ask all practices to consider stopping any private work they are doing to help free
up capacity.
We will make sure that funding does not influence clinical decision making by
ensuring that all GP practices in 2020/21 continue to be paid at rates that assume
that assume they would have continued to perform at the same levels from the
beginning of the outbreak as they had done previously, including for the purposes of
QOF, DES and LES payments.
This section:
• outlines the actions we are taking nationally now to support practices to free
up capacity – see table 1
• identifies activities that practices can suspend in the circumstances set out
where this is necessary to free up capacity to support the COVID-19 response
– see table 2. This may be added to or amended in due course as required
• recommends that commissioners suspend their locally commissioned
services, schemes and pilots unless these will directly support the response to
the Covid-19 outbreak – see table 3.
From the date of this letter until a new announcement is made, a practice is not
required to provide the activities set out in table (ii) where this is necessary as a
result of work generated by the COVID-19 response and where that would be
clinically appropriate as part of clinical prioritisation.
Commissioners are expected not to take remedial action under the contract in such
circumstances and swift changes to Regulations are expected to give statutory force
to this position. We will update practices once these Regulations come into force.
4. Further communications
We will continue to send regular updates, hold regular webinars and share
information as the situation unfolds. On Thursday 11th March we held two webinars.
The first discussed the move from the contain to delay phases, and support in place
for colleagues and patients. The second discussed how to use remote triaging and
online consultations in managing COVID-19. Although more than 1,000 people
attended each webinar, we recognise that not everyone who wanted to attend would
have been able to. They will be uploaded to our website on this page:
www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
http://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
The next webinar will be held today (Thursday 19 March), at 5pm. To join either:

Table 1: Actions we are taking nationally to free up capacity in general practice
Activity Update
1 QOF for 2019/20
QOF activity for 2019/20 is
largely complete and QOF
calculations will be made
as usual.
However, given the priority
that may need to be given
to COVID-19 work, we will
undertake a piece of
analysis to confirm the
impact and will make a
one-off adjustment for
practices who earned less
in 2019/20 than 2018/19
as a result of COVID-19
activities.
2 QOF for 2020/21 We will protect QOF
income as necessary to
respond to COVID-19.
3 Dispensary Services
Quality Scheme (DSQS)
payments
For dispensing practices
only, the DSQS will be
suspended with immediate
effect, with income
protected. This includes
ceasing DRUMs with
immediate effect.
Medication review should
continue if essential.
4 Investment and Impact
Fund (IIF)
We will defer the
introduction of an incentive
scheme for at least the first
half of 2020/21. Investment
for the first two quarters of
2020/21 will not be lost to
PCNs.
5 Network Contract DES
service requirements
The funding attached to
the PCN DES in 20/21 will
continue to be available to
practices signing up. The
introduction of the
Structured Medication
Review and Medicines
Optimisation Service
Specification will be
postponed, in the first
instance until October
2020.
Networks should make
every possible effort, to
begin work on the early
Cancer Diagnosis
specification as planned,
unless work to support the
COVID-19 response
intervenes.
People who are concerned
about any symptoms
related to suspected
cancer should still contact
their GP and GPs should
make sure they continue to
refer those for suspected
cancer for diagnostic tests
as normal.
Given the importance of
delivering a coordinated
service to care homes, the
Enhanced Health in Care
Homes service
requirements will continue
in line with the dates set
out in the 2020/21 GP
contract deal, and we will
ensure alignment with
COVID-19 pathways.
6 Network Contract DES:
workforce returns
The additional workforce
under the ARRS will be
critical to the COVID-19
response. However, we
recognise that PCNs may
need more time to
consider their workforce
needs.
We will therefore delay the
deadlines for the workforce
planning templates from 30
June to 31 August 2020,
and the associated
requirements on CCGs to
redistribute unused

https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/update-to-the-gp-contract-agreement-v2-updated.pdf
additional roles funding to
other PCNs until the end of
September 2020.
7 Appraisals and revalidation We strongly recommend
that appraisals are
suspended, unless there
are exceptional
circumstances agreed by
both the appraisee and
appraiser.
This should
immediately increase
capacity in our workforce
by allowing appraisers to
return to clinical practice.
Until reinstated,
responsible officers should
classify appraisals which
are affected as ‘approved
missed’ appraisals.
For
clarity, affected appraisals
will be regarded as
cancelled, not postponed.
Separate advice on
revalidation is being
issued.
In the meantime, for those
doctors where appraisal
has been cancelled and a
recommendation is due,
responsible officers are
reminded that they may
make a positive
recommendation if the
required supporting
information has otherwise
been presented earlier in
the doctor’s revalidation
cycle.
At the same time, if
needed, doctors can be
reassured that deferral is a
neutral act and has no
impact on their ability to
practice as normal.
8 Scale down of CQC
inspections
CQC has announced that
from 16th March routine
inspections will be
suspended.
Table 2: Further activities practices may wish to consider suspending if
necessary to free up capacity for COVID-19 response
Activity Recommendation
9 New patient reviews
(including alcohol
dependency)
Practices may wish to
suspend the offer of a
consultation within six
months to new patients
joining the practice list
(including alcohol
dependency screening).
Using their clinical
judgement, contractors
may cancel consultations
which have been offered
but not yet taken up.
Where, in their clinical
judgement, the contractor
considers a patient to be
high risk and should
receive a consultation, it
should be undertaken
remotely or in exceptional
cases by home visit.
10 Over-75 health checks Where a patient who is
over 75 and who has not
had a consultation in the
previous 12 months, they
may request one for a
health check as per the
GMS contract. Contractors
may, using their clinical
judgement, not provide
that consultation if in their
judgement that is not the
right priority. They must, if
they consider it clinically
necessary for the patient to
have a consultation for any
reason, including in
relation to COVID-19,
continue to deliver that via
the appropriate channel.
11 Annual patient reviews,
including under QOF
These can be deferred if
necessary (possibly to
recommence from
October) unless they can
be viably conducted
remotely and/or in
exceptional cases in
person or by home visit as
per local clinical discretion.
12 Routine medication
reviews
These can be deferred if
necessary (possibly to
recommence from
October) unless they can
be viably conducted
remotely and/or in
exceptional cases in
person or by home visit as
per local clinical discretion.
Key medication reviews
should continue where a
patient is being regularly
monitored.
13 Clinical reviews of frailty These can be deferred
(possibly to recommence
from October) including
medication review, patient
discussion, potential
medical interventions and
recording of those
interventions for patients
over 65 living with severe
frailty. Where, in the
contractor’s clin ical
judgement, such a review
is necessary they should
be conducted remotely
and/or in exceptional
cases in person or by
home visit as per local
clinical discretion.
14 Friends and Family Test
(FFT)
Practices will not be
required to report to
commissioners about FFT
results.
15 Engagement with and
review of feedback from
Practices can suspend
engaging with and / or
reviewing feedback from
Patient Participation
Groups (PPG)
their PPG, and may pause
implementing any
improvements previously
agreed between the
practice and the PPG
unless, in the contractor’s
opinion, those are clinically
necessary. Consideration
should also be given to
stopping any similar local
activity that might involve
gatherings of potentially
vulnerable patients.
16
Dispensing list cleansing
For dispensing practices,
dispensing patient list
cleansing exercises can be
deferred (possibly to
recommence from
October) until these
measures have been
formally rescinded.
17 PCN clinical director PCN Clinical Directors may
delegate many of their
functions to a non-clinician
where appropriate. The
Core PCN Funding
(£1.50/head) and Clinical
Director funding may both
be used to secure
additional non-clinical
support to the Clinical
Director and to support the
COVID-19 response.
Table 3: Services and activities we are recommending local commissioners
consider suspending
Activity Recommendation
18 LESs/LISs and local and
national pilots
Unless commissioned
services are considered to
support the national
COVID-19 response,
LES/LISs, local pilots,
regional or nationally
commissioned pilots
should cease, based on
local discretion. Funding,
particularly to support
staffing, should be
maintained and re-directed
to the primary medical care
COVID-19 response.
Given the importance of
care homes services to the
COVID-19 response, and
the continued
implementation of the
Enhanced Health in Care
Homes service through the
Network Contract DES,
commissioners should not
decommission local care
homes services until the
requirements in the DES
come into effect, and
should ensure a carefully
managed transition from
local to national
requirements.
19 Local audit and local
assurance activities
Unless considered to
support the national
COVID-19 response the
default should be to cease
or reduce frequency.
20 Other local data collections
Unless considered to
support the national
COVID-19 response the
default should be to cease
or decrease frequency.
Where a practice provides services under local arrangements set out in table iii
above, the practice must confirm the position with the relevant local commissioner
before suspending any activity.
.
Annex A
Digital primary care and COVID-19
The following sets out practical steps to support GP practices with remote triage and
remote management of patients to:
• Enable and use a triage first model at the point of access by patients to
general practice.
• Enable the public to receive advice and care without attending practices in
person, unless in-person care is clinically required.
• Use telephone, video and online consultation technology to support triage and
remote management of patients.
Specifically, commissioners, PCNs and practices should be taking the following
actions:
• All practices should move to a triage first model as rapidly as possible to
protect patients and staff from possible infection.
• To support a triage first model, practices and commissioners should either
promote online consultation services where they are in place or rapidly
procure online consultation services. Rapid procurement for those practices
that do not currently have an online consultation solution will be supported
through a national bundled procurement. This will be available within the next
14 days and will be accessed by commissioners on behalf of practices.
Commissioners should approach our regional teams for more information on
this process.
• Triage may be delivered by telephone but practices should also promote
online consultation and introduce an online consultation service where they
don’t already have it. Telephone access should be maintained to ensure
services are available to those patients where there are barriers to digital
access.
• Practices should manage patients remotely unless in-person care is clinically
required, in order to minimise infection risk.
• Current pre-booked appointments should be carried out remotely unless in -
person care is clinically required.
• Video consultations should be used for remote management where
possible. Options are being developed nationally to enable roll out of video
consultation capability to all practices as soon as possible.
• To support a triage first model, online appointments that are pre-bookable by
patients should be converted to remote triage appointments (as per previous
guidance) OR turned off where online pre-bookable appointments are not
part of the triage process (for example if all triage is handled through an online
consultation system).
• The contractual commitment requiring 25% of appointments to be available
online does not apply to practices that have implemented a triage first model.
• Practices must not turn off other patient-facing digital services, ie repeat
prescription ordering and patient access to medical records. These services
should still be available to patients via the NHS App and other tools. If this
functionality has been switched off, it should be switched back on.
• Practices should retain appointments for 111 to directly book on behalf of
patients who have been through 111 triage, but should offer these as
telephone/video appointments unless in-person care is clinically necessary.
• Practices should enable record sharing across PCNs (as a minimum), where
this is not already in place.
• Patients should be strongly encouraged to use online services for repeat
prescription ordering.
• Practices must use the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) and should aim
to move patients to electronic repeat dispensing unless there is a clinical
reason not to do so. There should be no move to increase the duration of
prescriptions.
Some guidance or resources have been linked to above. Additional guidance and
resources on all these points will be rapidly developed for commissioners and
practices and will be made available on the our primary care coronavirus web pages
and on the Digital Primary Care Future NHS Site.
Commissioners should be identifying and reprioritising implementation resources in
their area to support practices and PCNs in delivering the above. Where there are
gaps and issues these should be discussed with NHS England and NHS
Improvement Regional Teams.
We recognise the importance of explaining these changes to patients and have
developed the following message for patients to support this, to be used as needed.
To reduce your chances of catching COVID-19 and reduce pressure on your
local GP practice during this busy time, appointments will be carried out over
the phone or through (ADD OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE) unless there is a
clinical need for you to come into the practice.
This will help minimise risk
while continuing to ensure people get the care and advice they need.
NHSx Digital Primary Care – text messaging and remote working advice for
Practices
SMS messaging
At this time, practices will need to be able to send messages to patients in much
greater volume than normal.
Most areas already have unlimited SMS plans. For
those that don’t and need additional credits for SMS messaging, they should urgently
secure the additional capacity through their local commissioning groups.
If your
CCG needs additional funding to cover this, please ask that they contact
pcdt@nhsx.nhs.uk.

https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
https://www.england.nhs.uk/digitaltechnology/
mailto:pcdt@nhsx.nhs.uk
Remote working - laptops
GP practice staff will increasingly need to work from home or in settings outside the
practice. Some areas have already deployed laptops or other forms of remote
working for practice staff.
Where this has not happened and where additional
equipment is urgently needed, local commissioners will provision the equipment and
support services.
If local commissioners are unable to respond either through lack of
equipment or funding or both, we will support them nationally.
Please note that any
equipment used for access to clinical systems must conform with Securing
Excellence in Primary Care: The Primary Care (GP ) Digital Services Operating
Model 2020-21 standards.. A minimum specification and guidance for any laptop
devices procured for emergency purposes can be found at the end of this section.
Smartcards
Smartcards will be needed for certain functions in clinical systems such as electronic
prescription service and electronic referral service.
Smartcards are provided through
local commissioners who should be able to respond to your needs.
If that isn’t
happening, please contact pcdt@nhsx.nhs.uk..
Remote working – Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
NHSX has provided advice on staff using their own devices for access to NHS
systems during this period.
If your Data Protection Officer or Caldicott Guardian is unsure of appropriate action
to take, you can direct Information Governance questions to the NHSX IG Policy
team. If local commissioners are unable to respond either through lack of equipment
or funding or both, we will support them nationally, please ask that they contact
pcdt@nhsx.nhs.uk..
Telephony
If practices don’t have enough telephone capacity to deal with inbound calls from
patients and outbound calls from practices, please let us know as we are looking to
understand the extent of additional funding that might be required.
Headsets
Headsets are likely to be required to support telephone and video consultation.
Please advise if you need additional equipment and we will advise arrangements for
funding.
If you need more advice, please contact:
pcdt@nhsx.nhs.uk.
Please note we will be working with regional offices and CCGs to ensure they are
able to meet these requirements.
Remote working
The most appropriate method of connection is via a HSCN VPN token which will
provide connectivity to the clinical application, we are stipulating the provision of
smart card readers to enable spine connected services to function. Further

connection to practice specific information such as shared drives etc. should only be
provided through devices supplied and maintained by your GP IT delivery partner.
This approach eliminates a number of security and data handling risks.
We are
continually reviewing alternative methods to provide remote working capability and

Data Security and Protection Toolkit Submission 2019/20
It is critically important that we remain resilient to cyber attacks during this period of
COVID-19 response. The Data Security & Protection Toolkit (DSPT) helps
organisations check they are in a good position to do that. Most organisations will
already have completed, or be near completion of, their DSPT return for 2019/20.
However, in light of events, NHSX recognises that it will be difficult for many
organisations to fully complete the toolkit without impacting on their COVID-19
response.
NHSX has therefore taken the decision to push back the final deadline for
DSPT submissions to 30 June 2020.
Organisations can choose to complete DSPT
before that date. If they do so, and if they fully meet the standard, those
organisations will be awarded 'Standards Met' status, as in previous years.
Where organisations have separate agreements with commissioners or in formation
sharing partners, the existing deadline remains unchanged unless agreed between
relevant parties.
Whilst the DSPT submission deadline is being relaxed to account for COVID-19, the
cyber security risk remains high.
All organisations must continue to maintain their
patching regimes. Trusts, CSUs and CCGs must continue to comply with the strict
48hr and 14 day requirements in relation to acknowledgment of, and mitigation for,
any High Severity Alerts issued by NHS Digital (allowing for frontline service
continuity).
This message will be made available on the news page of the news page of the Data
Security and Protection Toolkit.
Further advice for organisations completing their Data Security and Protection
Toolkit assessment is available from www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Home/Contact
Temporary lifting of restrictions for GP retainers who wish to opt in for
additional sessions
We recognise that some retained GPs may wish to support efforts to ease the
challenges primary care may face in relation to COVID-19. NHS England and NHS
Improvement is temporarily lifting the restrictions on the maximum number of day
time in hours sessions GPs currently supported by the National GP Retention
Scheme may conduct, provided the following two conditions are met:
1. Retained GPs’ increased participation is voluntary.
2. Retained GPs have access to their existing level of support including in
supervision during this period and that their needs are reviewed regularly.
Retained GPs, who wish to increase their sessional commitment above their agreed
number under the GP Retention Scheme, should notify their CCG via the local HEE
scheme lead of their intention.
Retained GPs and their employing practice will continue to receive the financial
support in line with their existing agreement. Any additional sessions retained
GPs choose to undertake during this temporary lift will not attract additional
scheme payments.
This position is effective immediately and for one calendar month in the first instance
(until 10 April 2020). The position will be reassessed regularly and is subject to
change.
Offer of PPV vaccine in response to COVID-19
We ask that where feasible and where vaccine stock is available, that you continue
seeking to identify and offer Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (PPV23) to
those eligible.
Given recent vaccine constraints, we recognise that PPV23 can be

To: All NHS Medical Directors
All NHS Nursing Directors
Dear colleagues,
CARING FOR PEOPLE AT HIGHEST RISK DURING COVID-19 INCIDENT
We are writing to ask for your help with the management and shielding of patients
who are at the highest risk of severe morbidity and mortality from coronavirus
(COVID-19).
On Monday 16th March the UK government announced a package of measures,
advising those who are or may be at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19
to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures.
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-
and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-
protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults
This wider group, who broadly speaking comprise the criteria of adults eligible for an
annual flu vaccine, will not all be proactively contacted but have been asked to take
steps to reduce their social interactions in order to reduce the transmission of
coronavirus.
There is a subset of this group who have clinical conditions which are likely to put
people at the highest risk of mortality and severe morbidity from COVID-19. We have
identified this group, based on expert consensus.
The method for this is described in
annex 1.
The group includes:
1. Solid organ transplant recipients
2. People with specific cancers
• People with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radical
radiotherapy for lung cancer
• People with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia,
lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment
• People having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for
cancer
• People having other targeted cancer treatments which can affect the
immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors.
• People who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last 6
months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs.
3. People with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic fibrosis, severe
asthma and severe COPD
21 March 2020
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults
2
4. People with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that significantly
increase the risk of infections (such as SCID, homozygous sickle cell)
5. People on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly increase
risk of infection
6. People who are pregnant with significant congenital heart disease
People identified as being in these groups will be sent a letter with advice on how to
protect themselves and access the care and treatment they need during the
COVID19 incident. This involves strict social isolation with no contact from the
outside world beyond that absolutely necessary, for a period of at least 12 weeks; a
move which will significantly impact quality of life, increase social isolation, and
would not be without its own attendant physical and mental health risks.
We identified a core group of patients who are being contacted centrally.
In addition
to this, a number of medical subspecialties in secondary care will receive guidance
asking them to identify and contact additional patients in their caseload who fall
under Group 1 category 5 (see annex 1).
We ask that you take specific care in
reviewing the needs of any cancer patients who meet the above criteria.
This is
because some of these patients will not yet show up in central data records, and
therefore will not have been sent the letter.
We ask that you identify those
patients and immediately send them the attached letter, as soon as you can
this week.
The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges will also be cascading general guidance for
hospital specialties to help them identify and contact further high risk patients from
their caseload. Finally RCGP will be issuing guidance to GPs to help them identify
and contact high risk patients from their own caseload (for example those with
severe multimorbidity).
We ask that you work with your clinical teams to review all ongoing care for all
patients who you believe fall into one of these groups, taking account of the actions
we have set out below. To help with this, trusts shortly will be contacted with a list of
patients who have been centrally identified as being in one of the group 1 categories
and who have an active episode of care with your organisation.
When discussing treatment and care with any patients considered to be high risk,
please ensure they are aware that they should be shielding in line with PHE
guidance available at https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus.
Please also note that
although protective shielding is strongly encouraged for these patients it is also
voluntary, and that patients on end of life care pathways should be excluded.
Where you identify other patients who you consider to be at the very highest risk,
please write to them and, in each case, inform their GP that you have done, so their
records can be updated.
For all patients in the groups above, please work with your clinical teams to:
1. Ongoing care arrangements
https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus
3
Immediately review any ongoing care arrangements that you have with patients that
fall into these groups.
Wherever possible, patient contact, triage and treatment should be provided by
phone, email or online to support these patients to stay at home.
If adjustments can
be made to support this, we ask that you contact patients directly to confirm any new
arrangements.
Some highest risk patients will need to continue attending the hospital or clinic to
receive ongoing care.
Patients have been advised that, unless they hear from you,
they should assume their care will continue as planned.
We are currently developing guidance for Patient Transport Services to ensure that,
where this group of higher risk patients do not have direct access to private
transport, they can still attend hospital and clinic appointments without the need for
public transport.
2. Support with medicine supplies:
Patients have been informed that repeat prescription durations will not change during
this incident, and that patients will need to ensure that their medication can be
collected or delivered to them directly.
Patients who currently have their medication delivered, by a nominated person or by
a pharmacy, should continue to do so.
Patients who need regular medicine but have not yet set up online ordering and
delivery will need to be supported to do so.
We ask that you arrange that suitable
patients be put on electronic repeat dispensing as soon as possible.
Patients have been asked to arrange their own delivery or collection of their
prescriptions through a nominated person, online delivery or delivery from a
community pharmacy.
If they struggle to do this, we have recommended they
contact their GP practice for support.
3. Support with daily living
We have encouraged patients to discuss their daily needs while they have to stay at
home with their carers, friends, families and local community groups.
This includes
support for physical needs such as food and shopping deliveries, as well as their
mental health needs. If they do not have anyone who can help they, they can visit
www.gov.uk/coronavirus-extremely-vulnerable.
4. Urgent medical attention
All patients who display symptoms of COVID-19, have been asked to contact the
NHS 111 online coronavirus service (https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/), or call NHS 111 if
they do not have access to the internet.
However, if patients have an urgent medical question relating to their pre-existing
condition, we have asked that they contact their GP, or their specialist consultant,
directly.
http://www.gov.uk/coronavirus-extremely-vulnerable
https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/

5. Looking after your own health
It is important that you look after your and your staff’s own health and wellbeing at
this time.
If, at any point, you think you or a member of your team have developed symptoms
of COVID-19, such as a new, continuous cough and/or high temperature (above
37.8), seek clinical advice using the NHS 111 online coronavirus service
(https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/) or, if you do not have access to the internet, call NHS
111.

Annex 1 – Identification of Vulnerable Groups: Methods from CMO
This annex explains the basis of the latest advice that has been sent to all patients
who are considered to be at highest risk of mortality and severe morbidity from
coronavirus (COVID-19). Emerging clinical data about COVID-19 indicated that the
death rate would be high for groups of people with particular chronic diseases. The
modelling suggests that if we were able to effectively shield these people it would
have a significant positive effect on the fatality rate in that group and overall (but a
modest effect on the overall curve). This group has therefore been recommended to
undertake shielding measures for their own protection.
In order to be effective these people would have to undergo strict social isolation with
no contact from the outside world beyond that absolutely necessary, for a period of
at least 12 weeks. A move which will significantly impact quality of life, increase
social isolation, and would not be without its own attendant physical and mental
health risks. We therefore drew up a list of conditions which we felt would justify
affected individuals taking such extreme measures. This group are a subset of a
wider more generally vulnerable group (broadly any adult eligible for an annual flu
vaccine), who have already been advised to follow social distancing measures to
reduce their number of contacts for a period of at least 12 weeks.
We developed a four pronged approach towards ensuring coverage across affected
groups by 1) identifying a core group of patients to be contacted centrally by NHS
England; 2) providing guidance to medical subspecialties in
secondary care and
asking them to identify and contact additional patients in their caseload who fall
under Group 1 category 5; 3) working with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges
to cascade general guidance for hospital specialties to help them identify and contact
further high risk patients from their caseload; 4) working with RCGP to issue
guidance to GPs to help them identify and contact high risk patients from their own
caseload (for example those with severe multimorbidity).
Group 1
We took the following steps when drawing up the list of patients who can be
identified centrally by extracting relevant groups from national datasets:
a) NHS England Clinical Reference Groups (groups of experts who advise the
NHS on Direct Commissioning) were asked to consider which conditions
would put patients at intermediate, high or very high risk of severe morbidity
or mortality from COVID-19
b) Based on our current understanding and specialist and wider advice senior
clinicians (NHSE, NHS Digital, PHE, CMO, DCMOs) categorised these
conditions into the following high risk groups (see below)
1. Solid organ transplant recipients
2. People with specific cancers
• People with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radical
radiotherapy for lung cancer
6
• People with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia,
lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment
• People having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments
for cancer
• People having other targeted cancer treatments which can affect the
immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors.
• People who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last
6 months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs.
3. People with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic
fibrosis, severe asthma and severe COPD
4. People with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that
significantly increase the risk of infections (such as SCID,
homozygous sickle cell disease)
5. People on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly
increase risk of infection
6. People who are pregnant with significant heart disease, congenital or
acquired
Group 2
There are some patients on this list who will be contacted by other routes due to
limitations in national datasets. For example, Cancer Units will contact all patients in
category 2; secondary care will contact most of the patients in category 5 via a
cascade from the Royal College of Physicians and associated medical societies
Group 3
In addition, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges will ask its members to identify
any other subgroups of patients they feel are at high risk, and will cascade templates
to hospital specialists. We will ask clinicians who have identified these patients to let
them know directly using a standard letter containing the information they need to
commence shielding and access support. We will ask hospital specialists to inform
the GP of the decision to include patients in the vulnerable group.
Group 4
In addition, we will issue GPs with specific guidance around identification of high risk
patients with complex / severe multimorbidity and ask the GP to contact these
groups directly to recommend they are considered for inclusion in the shielding
group.
We accept that given this is a new and rapidly moving disease there are inevitable
limitations in our methodology but have designed the most robust approach that was
possible at pace with the aim of identifying the maximum number of vulnerable
individuals in sufficient time to effectively shield this group.",6ce08fd2-b259-4d8c-b57c-80149351db0f.pdf

COVID-19: NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme
19 March 2020
Dear all
Following the announcement of social distancing recommendations to help prevent
the spread of COVID-19, we are writing to set out temporary changes to the delivery
of the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme (NHS DPP).
Recommendations to limit unnecessary social contact mean that group-based face-
to-face delivery of the NHS DPP is no longer in line with government advice. As
such, we will stop delivering group-based face-to-face services on Friday 20
March 2020.
We have worked with NHS DPP providers to make temporary arrangements for the
continued delivery of the programme using fully remote arrangements. While each
provider’s remote offer will have subtle differences, all will have no in-person face-to-
face contact – for example, using telephone-based coaching. Alongside this we will
continue to offer digital services, again without in-person face-to-face contact. This
will ensure that all NHS DPP delivery is in line with government advice.
There may be temporary disruption in the flow of sessions to active participants as
providers move from a face-to-face to remote delivery model. We will work with
providers during this time to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible and to
minimise disruption to people participating in the programme.
• For participants who have already begun group-based face-to-face services, any
further in-person sessions will be cancelled from Friday 20 March 2020, and they
will move to a remote delivery model, following the same curriculum.
• Participants who have already begun the digital service will continue as planned.
• Participants who have not started a programme yet, or who are referred over the
coming months, will be offered a remote or digital programme. This will include a
phone option for those who are not digitally enabled.
• For participants who decline remote delivery and express a preference for face-
to-face groups, there will be the option of waiting until normal face-to-face
delivery is resumed, and they will not be discharged in the interim.
Next steps
• Providers will communicate details of their revised delivery arrangements with
you over the coming days, and we will amend contracts with providers to support
these alternative arrangements.
• Providers will tell participants about the cancellation of in-person sessions and
arrangements for establishing new remote sessions. Providers are asked to
share communications with site leads.
• We will monitor service delivery under these new arrangements and provide data
to regions and local teams to enable review of delivery.
We will continue to review our position in response to emerging government advice
and tell you about changes.
Queries should be directed to England.ndpp@nhs.net.
Many thanks for your continued support of the programme.

Annex 2
Supporting our most vulnerable people
Preserving and protecting the health, safety and wellbeing of staff and keeping them
well is critical for the NHS as we respond to the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19). It
is essential that NHS organisations take every effort to support the physical and
mental wellbeing of our people to enable them to stay healthy and protect
themselves, colleagues, patients and families as we continue to deliver services
through this challenging period.
All NHS staff should be provided with supportive self-care advice in this period,
encouraged to rest, take any regular and prescribed medication and to look after
themselves and their teams.
Staff with comorbidity and those in higher risk groups
The Government is actively reviewing the advice to protect those people who are at
significantly increased risk from COVID-19 due to underlying health conditions. The
staff groupings can be seen at point 1 below. The national guidance should be
referenced and applied to staff who are in these groups.
Comorbidity is a medical term that is applied when individuals have multiple health
conditions that co-exist.
People with comorbidity are more likely to develop complications with their health.
Viruses can make chronic health problems worse and high risk groups may
experience a worsening of their conditions.
1) Staff in the very high risk groups
The NHS in England will now be directly contacting individuals who are deemed to
be high risk to recommend that they take more stringent measures to protect
themselves due to specific clinical conditions. The emphasis will be on both
protecting individuals and redeploying any staff who need to be into services, such
as 111, ambulance dispatch, virtual patient consultations. Individuals will be
contacted by the NHS Business Services Authority, GP practice or specialist, week
commencing 23 March and they will provide detailed advice on what steps
individuals should take next and why.
People who will be contacted are those who
may be at particular risk due to complex health problems such as:
1. Solid organ transplant recipients
2. People with specific cancers:
• People with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radical
radiotherapy for lung cancer
2
• People with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia,
lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment
• People having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for
cancer
• People having other targeted cancer treatments which can affect the immune
system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors.
• People who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last 6
months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs.
3. People with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic fibrosis, severe
asthma and severe COPD
4. People with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that significantly
increase the risk of infections (such as SCID, homozygous sickle cell)
5. People on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly increase risk of
infection
6. People who are pregnant with significant congenital heart disease
For the small number of NHS staff in this category, organisations can help staff by:
• Advising them not to contact their GP or healthcare team and to wait until they
are contacted directly. In this period, if staff identify to this category, they should
be supported to work flexibly, remotely or be redeployed from any high risk area.
• If staff have not been contacted by end of the week commencing 23 March by the
NHS, their GP or specialist and think they may be at particular risk due to these
specific health conditions, they should then get in touch with their GP practice for
further advice.
• Where staff receive a call from the NHS Business Services Authority, they should
then contact their line manager to discuss reasonable adjustments.
• Where staff are contacted and advice is provided to them, organisations should
support them as much as possible to adjust to this and allow them time to make
any necessary personal arrangements
2) Staff in ‘at risk’ groups
In addition, advice from Government confirmed that the groups of people who should
take particular care to minimise their social contact were:
• People over the age of 70
• Other adults who would normally be advised to have a flu vaccine (such as
those with chronic disease)
• Pregnant women. We know The Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists will provide and regularly review/ revise the latest guidance
and information. We therefore advise all staff who are pregnant to discuss
their individual circumstances with their local Occupational Health department.
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/news/national-guidance-on-managing-coronavirus-infection-in-pregnancy-published/
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/news/national-guidance-on-managing-coronavirus-infection-in-pregnancy-published/
3
For staff members in this category, the NHS will support staff to stay well and at
work. NHS organisations should make adjustments to enable this wherever possible.
Adjustments may include working remotely or moving to a lower risk area. Line
managers should get support from the locally nominated EPRR lead or, for example,
Medical/Nursing director or Chief Operating Officer to make this happen. NHS
organisations are encouraged to make it clear who the point of contact is in this
regard.
Action to be taken for staff will depend upon their condition and how stable it is.
Where a condition is unstable and there may be an increased risk to staff, the locally
nominated lead should ensure that conversations are undertaken with those staff as
to what steps need to be taken to keep an individual safe, and specialist advice
taken as required. In addition, they will continue to need the support of their line
manager and local occupational health service.
Where staff have to be redeployed or work from home, consideration should be
given to what duties they can continue to carry out in a role, and what support they
will need to do this.
Assistance should be provided to those staff who might be working or deployed in
higher risk areas by:
• Ensuring they are aware of the PHE guidance and how they can protect
themselves.
• Talk to them about their role and any elements which may put them at greater
risk.
• Discuss and develop a plan to implement any reasonable adjustments where
required, e.g. redeployment into less high-risk areas, reduced travel, working
from home.
• Seeking further advice from Occupational Health in the first instance, where
required further consultation with their specialist doctor regarding their
underlying condition in order to optimise their condition where possible.
• Signpost to further areas of support e.g. EAP programmes, counselling,
Our people are the most important consideration as they respond to the Coronavirus
pandemic. In these unprecedented times, our people more than ever will be making
every effort to care for patients and the population, and we must equal that with the
care for them.",b43ea795-319d-4d27-b19f-3e51e5b999bc.pdf

Dear HR colleague
Firstly, thank you for your continued commitment and work to support our people
through this unprecedented time.
In the last few days I have shared with you a number of communications to ensure
that you are fully sighted and kept informed of any new developments in our
response to COVID-19 and I am sincerely grateful for your ongoing support in this
unprecedented situation.
The health and wellbeing of our local communities and all colleagues working across
health and care is at the very centre of our collective efforts and attention and I know
we will continue to stand alongside our frontline colleagues and do everything in our
power to support them.
I appreciate that many of you are already resolving issues together locally and with
your ICS/STP leads and Regional Directors of Workforce & OD. I have heard of
some fantastic examples of local businesses reaching out directly to the NHS to offer
support and facilities, as well as joined up solutions with local authorities to support
childcare issues.
As we continue to work at pace with NHS Employers and our other partners, I
wanted to share with you some immediate updates:
Access to schools and childcare for children of ‘Key Workers’
The following definition has been provided by the Government for health and social
care:
This includes but is not limited to doctors, nurses, midwives, paramedics, social
workers, care workers, and other frontline health and social care staff including
volunteers; the support and specialist staff required to maintain the UK’s health and
social care sector; those working as part of the health and social care supply chain,
including producers and distributers of medicines and medical and personal
protective equipment.
This definition therefore includes all NHS staff and our colleagues in the partner
organisations who support the delivery of healthcare services. Both parents do not
have to be key workers to qualify for this support. We must remember that the
decision to close schools and nurseries has been made to limit the spread of
COVID-19, which means that if it is at all possible for children to be at home, then
they should be. The key worker exemption is designed to enable our NHS people to
be able to work and know that their children are being cared for.
We encourage members of staff with dependent children to contact their school or
childcare provider to establish what arrangements they and the local authority are
planning to have in place from Monday.

Key Worker – identification template letter
To help with NHS staff identification for the purposes of childcare and access to
supermarkets etc, we are expecting local valid photo security passes to be used. In
addition, we’ve attached at Annex 1 a template letter which may also support your
staff to confirm their status as a Key Worker. Many of you will already have
instigated this but the template is intended to be helpful if not done already.
Pay, terms and conditions for people returning to the NHS
In collaboration with the Department of Health and Social Care, Public Health
England, Health Education England and NHS Employers, and with input from the
NHS Staff Council Executive, latest pay, terms and conditions advice is being
collated into one central resource for workforce leaders in the NHS. The guidance I
hope will be issued early next week, once approved by Ministers.
ESR and recording absence
This is an urgent ask for your help and support so we can track and model
workforce data and make corresponding clinical and operational capacity
decisions about people needing urgent care.
It is vital that we are able to monitor all COVID-19 related absence and appreciate
the EPRR SitRep is an additional ask on top of normal absence-reporting
procedures, but currently, too little absence data is recorded if we are to stand this
element of the SitRep down. To enable all COVID-19 absence via ESR the following
is underway:
• Non-rostered staff: ESR has issued guidance (User Notices 2864 and 2868) on
this topic. Any type of absence can be recorded as ‘related’ to COVID-19,
whether that be special leave, self-isolation (recorded as Medical suspension with
pay) or actual sickness. You may have more detailed local arrangements but we

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers
ask that any absence recorded for non-rostered staff has the ‘related reason’ set
as COVID-19 for consistency.
• Rostered staff: we are working with a major e-rostering provider to have a
national COVID-19 code which will flow back into the appropriate field in ESR.
Please look for further communication from your e-rostering supplier about this.
Vulnerable staff groups
Attached at Annex 2 is a detailed note updating you on the definition of vulnerable
staff groups and the action that will be taken the week commencing 23 March. In
addition, there are specific actions every employer is being asked to take to support
their staff in high and at risk groups.
The NHS Employers website continues to be updated and I encourage you to keep
reviewing it: https://www.nhsemployers.org/covid19
Looking after staff right across the NHS remains a top priority, and that includes you.
Please keep sharing your insights and experiences with each other and with me.
There is an incredible wealth of experience and expertise in our professional
community and together we can make a difference for all our NHS staff at this critical
time.
Best wishes

NHS England and NHS Improvement
Briefing: Primary care providers and the coronavirus (COVID-19)
The NHS and Public Health England (PHE) are well prepared for outbreaks of new
infectious diseases. The NHS has put in place measures to ensure the safety of all patients
and NHS staff while also ensuring services are available to the public as normal.
The approach being taken by the NHS is to identify potential cases of COVID-19, isolate
them and then contain the virus. This model is devised to protect primary care, the
ambulance service and our emergency departments so they can operate as usual and
assist the sickest patients.
What is the advice to patients and the public?
The advice to the public is to call NHS 111 now if they have been:
• to Wuhan or Hubei Province in China in the last 14 days (even if they do not have
symptoms)
• to other parts of China, including Macau and Hong Kong, in the last 14 days and
have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breath (even if it's mild)
• to Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Republic of Korea or Malaysia in the last 14
days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breath (even if it's mild)
• in close contact with someone with confirmed coronavirus.
Anyone who meets the above criteria is advised not to go to a GP surgery, community
pharmacy or hospital. Instead they should call NHS 111, stay indoors and avoid close
contact with other people.
Information for the public is available at nhs.uk
Is NHS 111 directing possible cases to GP practices and community pharmacies?
No. If someone calls NHS 111 they are assessed against a clinical pathway. If they are
identified as a possible COVID-19 case, NHS 111 will not refer them to a GP or community
pharmacy.
However, if someone calls NHS 111 and is assessed against the clinical pathway and they
are not a possible COVID-19 case, for example they have not recently travelled to any of
the affected areas or been in close contact with a confirmed case, NHS 111 would handle
their call as normal. This may mean referring them to a GP, pharmacist or dental practice,
based on patient need.

Coronavirus Primary Care Briefing – 18 February 2020
What do primary care providers do if a patient turns up with suspected COVID-19?
PHE has produced detailed guidance for primary care providers which is available here.
The key principles are to:
• identify potential cases as soon as possible
• prevent potential transmission of infection to other patients and staff
• avoid direct physical contact, including physical examination, and exposures to
respiratory secretions
• isolate the patient, obtain specialist advice and determine if the patient is at risk of
COVID-19 infection.
This guidance also includes information on patient transfers and cleaning your premises
following a possible case.
What if I’m a community pharmacist without a consultation room?
If your pharmacy does not have a consultation room, it is effectively a public place. The
same advice that would be given to any suspected case should be followed: go home
immediately, avoid contact with others, cover your mouth and nose on the way home and
call NHS 111.
If I come into contact with a suspected case, should I continue to see other patients?
The guidance for healthcare workers covers those who have travelled or have come into
contact with a known case. However, if primary care providers come into contact (using the
definition of close contact here) with a suspected case they should continue to practise as
normal. Should the case then be confirmed, PHE will undertake contact tracing which may
include the practitioner.
Is there any information my practice can share with patients?
Additional resources have been made available for primary care providers. Please ensure
that you share and display these as appropriate:
• posters for primary care settings are available on the PHE campaign resource
website.
• additional resources for telephone systems, SMS messaging systems, websites and
online booking systems are available in Annex 1.
What happens if someone self-isolating because of COVID-19 risk calls for a review
for another problem – who should handle this?
Patients should call NHS 111 in the first instance and they will be directed to the
appropriate resource. If a GP visit is needed, a telephone consultation should be held. If a
home visit is needed, speak with your local Health Protection Team (HPT) for advice on
personal protective equipment (PPE). If a visit is advised, whoever does the visit needs to
keep a minimum of two metres distance from the patient and avoid physical examination.

Coronavirus Primary Care Briefing – 18 February 2020
What Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is needed when dealing with patients?
If following the above guidance, PPE should not be needed when dealing with patients as
patients should be identified on entry and isolated as soon as possible.
Dental teams should continue to comply with existing PPE guidance HTM01 and continue
to use the same PPE they routinely do.
Are there supply issues with PPE?
No, there is a large stock of face masks in the UK. PHE manages stocks of PPE, including
face masks as part of its Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) stockpiles. In addition to
UK-held stocks, NHS Supply Chain has placed additional orders for PPE and is also
working with wholesalers to support frontline services.
In addition to this, NHS Supply Chain manages a ‘business as usual’ stock of face masks
and routinely supplies NHS secondary care services with PPE, including face masks. NHS
Supply Chain also retains its EU exit stockpile, which includes stocks of PPE.
Who carries out decontamination?
Every General Medical Practitioner (GMP) and General Dental Practitioner (GDP) has to be
registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and should be meeting the
requirements for the Health and Social Care Act to maintain a clean and safe environment.
It is the responsibility of the registered organisation to ensure their staff are appropriately
trained and have access to equipment. Details of how to clean are in the primary care
guidance.
Other primary care settings should follow the guidance. For additional information you can
contact your local Health Protection Team.
What PPE is needed when cleaning?
Use the PPE equipment that would normally be used when cleaning and disinfecting, in the
same way as if someone had vomited in the surgery. Cleaners should use disposable
plastic aprons and gloves and follow the usual cleaning COSH guidance. You do not need
Hazmat equipment to clean. The gloves and disposable aprons should already be available
and in supply at primary care providers.
What happens if a provider needs to close?
If providers are following the advice set out in the guidance, they should be identifying
patients as soon as possible and isolating them. It is only necessary to clean and
decontaminate the areas where a suspected case has been isolated. It is not always
necessary to deep clean the whole premises where only one consultation room needs to be
cleaned.
If the primary care setting is advised to close by the HPT, normal procedures are to be
followed. So, for GPs this would involve alerting the CCG in order for local contingencies to
be activated. GDPs are to inform their dental commissioning leads that the practice is
closing on advice of the HPT.

Coronavirus Primary Care Briefing – 18 February 2020
If pharmacies have to shut, they must inform the NHS 111 Directory of Services (DoS)
helpline (0300 0200 363). If they are likely to be closed for longer than 24 hours then they
must be clear that they are requesting a longer term withdrawal from providing the NHS 111
DoS. The local NHS England and NHS Improvement team must also be informed by the
pharmacy contractor. This is particularly critical for pharmacies providing the Community
Pharmacist Consultation Service (CPCS).
We would expect closure to be temporary for cleaning, and contingency plans by the CCG
(or appropriate commissioner) will be activated. Further information is available in the full
guidance for primary care settings.
How are people tested for COVID-19?
Most cases will require a single nose and throat swab for the diagnosis of COVID-19 which
will be sent to PHE Colindale or identified regional laboratories for testing.
Samples required are:
• either a combined nose and throat swab in one collection tube containing universal
transport medium
• or a single swab used for throat then nose
• or individual nose and throat swabs in separate collection tubes.
What further information is available for primary care?
Information published by Public Health England is available here.
NHS England and NHS Improvement have established a primary care working group to
address issues that may arise should the virus spread – such as capacity, supply chain, any
contracting issues, additional support, etc. Appropriate information will be circulated if and
when the situation develops.
Does any of this impact upon indemnity?
At present, this work is considered to be business as usual. However, the primary care
working group is examining the impact upon indemnity should the virus spread.

Coronavirus Primary Care Briefing – 18 February 2020
Do not go to a GP surgery, community pharmacy or hospital. Call 111, stay
indoors and avoid close contact with other people.
Further information is available on nhs.uk.
Like the common cold, coronavirus infection usually occurs through close contact
with a person with novel coronavirus via cough and sneezes or hand contact. A
person can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces if they do not wash
their hands.
The risk of being in close contact with a person with coronavirus or contaminated
surfaces is very low at the current time, as members of the public who have visited
Wuhan or Hubei province, China are currently in isolation.
Testing of suspected coronavirus cases is carried out in line with strict regulations.
This means that suspected cases are kept in isolation, away from public areas of the
hospital and returned home also in isolation. Any equipment that come into contact
with suspected cases are thoroughly cleaned as appropriate. Specific guidance has
also been shared with NHS staff to help safeguard them and others. Patients can be
reassured that their safety is a top priority, and are encouraged to attend all
appointments as usual.
Everyone is being reminded to follow Public Health England advice to:
• Always carry tissues with you and use them to catch your cough or sneeze.
Then bin the tissue, and wash your hands, or use a sanitiser gel.
• Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after using public
transport. Use a sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available.
• Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
• Avoid close contact with people who are unwell.
You can find the latest information and advice from Public Health England at Further

Dear colleague
GUIDANCE ON SUPPLY AND USE OF PPE
We are setting out, in a single document, everything that you need to know on the
supply and use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
1. Supplies you will be receiving
We have now moved to providing substantial extra deliveries and support will be
available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Services across the NHS are urgently
being sent stocks of PPE to help them manage cases and potential cases of COVID-
19 and keep staff safe. See section 6 for details of equipment being sent.
• On Thursday 2.6 million face masks and 10,000 hand sanitisers went to trusts
in London.
• On Friday 150 hospital trusts will have extra PPE kit delivered. Over the
weekend every other hospital trust will receive a further special delivery of
PPE.
• Every GP practice, dental practice and community pharmacy has now had a
PPE delivery.
• All care homes, hospices, and home care providers will have a PPE delivery,
and these began earlier this week.
To meet your needs, we are putting on substantial extra deliveries. We will aim to
deliver these in usual working hours but, given the volume of deliveries, please
ensure your organisation is prepared to receive some deliveries at evenings and
weekends.
You can access NHS Supply Chain’s Delivery Schedule here:
https://www.supplychain.nhs.uk/covid19/delivery-schedules/
2. Reporting supply disruption
The supply distribution helpline can answer PPE calls and emails 24/7 via the supply
disruption helpline on 0800 915 9964 or email
supplydisruptionservice@nhsbsa.nhs.uk to help with queries. Emails will be
answered within one hour.
Trusts should raise non-PPE orders with NHS Supply Chain in the usual way.
3. Securing additional supplies from manufacturers
COVID-19 is generating unprecedented global demand on the supply chain,
combined with a manufacturing slowdown in affected countries, especially China
which manufactures a large amount of PPE.
Government, NHS Supply Chain, and the NHS are doing everything to work with
industry to secure additional supplies and manufacture further PPE.
4. Shelf life of PPE items
The NHS’s stockpiled PPE is checked as part of the stock management process
operated through the NHS Supply Chain. This means rotating stock to make sure
that items which have been there the longest are issued first.
Some products may appear to have out-of-date ‘use by/expiration’ dates or have
relabelled ‘use by/expiration’ dates. Please be assured products being issued have
passed stringent tests that demonstrate they are safe. The PPE is exposed to
extreme conditions for prolonged periods, to see how the product deteriorates. All
that are not up to standard are destroyed and not distributed to trusts.
We have been working with independent test facilities and the Health and Safety
Executive (HSE) who, after being provided with scientific evidence, were content
with our assessment that these are safe to use by NHS staff.
https://www.supplychain.nhs.uk/covid19/delivery-schedules/
mailto:supplydisruptionservice@nhsbsa.nhs.uk
5. Correct use of PPE
NHS England and NHS Improvement collates all advice to clinical staff, including
safe systems of working including the of use PPE, online here:
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/
The full COVID-19 guidance collection is available at
https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-covid-19-list-of-guidance
6. Putting on PPE and fit test training
Public Health England (PHE) recommended PPE ensemble for healthcare workers
within a metre of a patient with possible or confirmed COVID-19 is:
• Fluid repellent facemask
• Apron
• Gloves
• Eye protection if there is a risk of splashing
The recommended PPE ensemble to be used for aerosol generating procedures on
patients with possible or confirmed COVID-19 is:
• FFP3 respirator
• Long sleeved disposable gown
• Gloves
• Eye protection (disposable goggles or full-face visor)
Some healthcare workers will not have worn items like FFP3 respirators before. To
protect their safety, we are asking trusts to ensure that all relevant staff have
received the necessary fit test training.
PHE has engaged with RPA (an independent Respiratory Protective Equipment
(RPE) fit testing company) who are running fit-test training sessions via webinars to
help staff who will be training to use Qualitative or Quantitive fit test methods for
FFP3 respirators for the first time or those seeking refresher training to ensure they
are able to train FFP3 users safely. Booking on to these courses is via RPA’s
helpline on 07947 968972 and 07947 968922. This training is free.
The linked Public Health England poster is intended as a guide for staff about how to
put on PPE, including FFP3 respirators.

https://youtu.be/kKz_vNGsNhc
7. Disposing of PPE correctly
All PPE that is used when encountering confirmed cases of COVID-19 is single-use
only and should be changed immediately after each patient and/or following
completion of a procedure or task.
PPE should be disposed of after use into the correct waste stream i.e.
healthcare/clinical waste (this will require disposal via orange or yellow bag waste).
There might be further local guidance depending on the impact of the disease.
Please ensure the Public Health England poster on the removal of PPE for full
guidance on doing this safely is shared with staff.

gospodarstw domowych z
podejrzeniem zakażenia
koronawirusem (COVID-19)
Aktualizacja 16 marca 2020 r.
Objawy
Najczęstszymi objawami świadczącymi o zakażeniu koronawirusem (COVID-
19) są:
• utrzymujący się kaszel i/lub
• wysoka temperatura
U większości osób zakażenie koronawirusem (COVID-19) przebiega łagodnie.
Najważniejsze wytyczne
• osoby mieszkające samotnie, u których wystąpią nawet łagodne objawy
zakażenia koronawirusem (COVID-19), powinny pozostać w domu przez
7 dni od ich wystąpienia. (Więcej informacji na ten temat przedstawiono w
części dotyczącej zakończenia izolacji
• jeśli objawy koronawirusa wystąpią u któregokolwiek domownika w
domach zamieszkanych przez kilka osób, wszyscy członkowie
gospodarstwa domowego muszą pozostać w domu i nie opuszczać go
przez 14 dni. Okres 14 dni rozpoczyna się od dnia zachorowania
pierwszej osoby.
• prawdopodobnie osoby mieszkające w tym samym gospodarstwie
domowym będą zarażać się nawzajem lub już zostały zarażone.
Pozostanie w domu przez 14 dni w znacznym stopniu zredukuje ogólną
liczbę osób, które mogłyby zostać zakażone w społeczności lokalnej.
• każdy członek gospodarstwa domowego, który zacznie wykazywać
objawy musi pozostać w domu przez 7 dni od ich wystąpienia, niezależnie
od tego, który to będzie dzień z 14 ustalonych dni kwarantanny. (Więcej
informacji na ten temat przedstawiono w części dotyczącej zakończenia

• o ile to możliwe, należy przenieść osoby wymagające szczególnej opieki
(takie jak osoby w podeszłym wieku oraz te z istniejącymi problemami
zdrowotnymi) do znajomych lub rodziny na czas kwarantanny domowej.
• jeśli osoby wymagające szczególnej opieki muszą pozostać w domu,
należy przebywać jak najdalej od nich.
• w razie wystąpienia objawów koronawirusa:
• nie należy udawać się do przychodni zdrowia, apteki ani szpitala

Dla kogo przeznaczone są niniejsze wytyczne
Niniejsze wytyczne przeznaczone są dla:
• osób z objawami wywołanymi przez koronawirusa i niewymagajacymi
leczenia szpitalnego, które muszą pozostać w domu, dopóki nie poczują
się lepiej
• mieszkających w gospodarstwie domowym z osobami wykazującymi
objawy koronawirusa
Co może obecnie pomóc w przygotowaniach
Przygotowanie planu dla swojego gospodarstwa domowego lub rodziny
Najlepszym rozwiązaniem jest obecnie takie przygotowanie planu adaptacji swoich
codziennych czynności oraz czynności pozostałych członków gospodarstwa
domowego, aby można było zastosować się do wytycznych. Niektóre ze sposobów
umożliwiających przygotowania obejmują:
• rozmowy z sąsiadami i rodziną, aby wymienić się numerami telefonów
• rozważenie i ustalenie planu dla domowników uznanych za osoby
wymagające szczególnej pomocy
https://111.nhs.uk/
• opracowanie listy kontaktów z numerami telefonów sąsiadów, szkół,
pracodawcy, farmaceuty, NHS 111.
• w miarę możliwości założenie kont w sklepach świadczących usługę
zakupów przez Internet
Czy domownicy zostaną poddani testom po wystąpieniu u nich objawów
przypominających koronawirusa?
Badanie na obecność koronawirusa nie jest konieczne w razie pozostawania w
domu.
Dlaczego pozostawanie w domu jest tak ważne
Pozostawanie w domu przez osoby z objawami, które mogą być wywołane
wirusem jest bardzo ważne. Pozostawanie w domu pomoże w kontroli
rozprzestrzeniania się wirusa na znajomych, szerszą społeczność, a
szczególnie na osoby najbardziej narażone na zagrożenia.
Osoby mieszkające samotnie powinny pozostać w domu przez 7 dni po
wystąpieniu objawów (patrz część dotyczącą zakończenia samoizolacji
poniżej). Obniży to ryzyko zakażenia innych osób.
Jeżeli objawy koronawirusa wystąpią u któregokolwiek z domowników w
domach zamieszkanych przez kilka osób, wszyscy członkowie gospodarstwa
domowego muszą pozostać w domu i nie opuszczać go przez 14 dni (patrz
część dotyczącą zakończenia samoizolacjiponiżej). O ile to możliwe, nie
należy wychodzić z domu w celu innym niż aktywność fizyczna, nawet po
zakup żywności oraz innych niezbędnych rzeczy. W takim przypadku należy
zachować bezpieczną odległość od innych osób. 14-dniowy okres
rozpoczyna się od dnia zachorowania pierwszej osoby w gospodarstwie
domowym.
Jeśli to niemożliwe, należy dołożyć wszelkich starań, aby ograniczyć kontakty
towarzyskie po wyjściu z domu po zaopatrzenie.
Prawdopodobnie osoby mieszkające w tym samym gospodarstwie domowym
będą zarażać się nawzajem lub już zostały zarażone. Pozostanie w domu
przez 14 dni w znacznym stopniu zredukuje ogólną liczbę osób, które
mogłyby zostać zakażone w spłeczności lokalnej.
Pozostawanie w domu może być trudne i irytujące, ale można podjąć
działania, które to ułatwią. Należy do nich:
• planowanie z wyprzedzeniem i przemyślenie, co umożliwi pozostanie w
domu przez 7 lub 14 dni
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#ending-isolation
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#ending-isolation
• należy zwrócić się o pomoc do swojego pracodawcy, znajomych i rodziny,
aby uzyskać dostęp do produktów niezbędnych do pozostania w domu
• należy przemyśleć i zaplanować dostęp do żywności oraz innych
produktów, takich jak leki, które mogą być potrzebne podczas
pozostawania w domu
• należy zwrócić się z prośbą do znajomych i rodziny o dostarczenie
wszystkiego, co niezbędne lub złożenie zamówienia w Internecie,
upewniając się, że zostanie pozostawione przed domem
• należy pozostawać w kontakcie ze znajomymi i rodziną, wykorzystując
telefon lub media społecznościowe
• należy zastanowić się, co można robić podczas pozostawania w domu
Osoby, które przetrwały w domu okres kwarantanny starały się zajmować
gotowaniem, czytaniem, nauką w Internecie oraz oglądaniem filmów.
• dla wielu osób pomocne okazuje się dokładne zaplanowanie 14 dni, np.
za pomocą samodzielnie wykonanego kalendarza. Pomocne może
okazać się również wcześniejsze planowanie czynności, które należy
podjąć, jeśli któryś z domowników poczuje się znacznie gorzej,
doświadczając trudności z oddychaniem
• powracając do zdrowia, należy pamiętać o ćwiczeniach fizycznych, które
mogą poprawić samopoczucie W internecie można wyszukać lekcje i
kursy, które pomogą w wykonywaniu lekkich ćwiczeń w domu
Podczas pozostawania w domu należy wykonywać wskazane niżej czynności
Pozostać w domu
Wraz z pozostałymi członkami gospodarstwa domowego należy pozostać w
domu. Nie należy chodzić do pracy, szkoły oraz miejsc publicznych,
nie należy korzystać z transportu publicznego ani taksówek.
O ile to możliwe, nie należy wychodzić z domu w celu innym niż aktywność
fizyczna, nawet po zakup żywności oraz innych niezbędnych rzeczy. W takim
przypadku należy zachować bezpieczną odległość od innych osób. 14-
dniowy okres rozpoczyna się od dnia zachorowania pierwszej osoby.
Jeśli potrzebna jest pomoc przy zakupie artykułów spożywczych, innych
artykułów, odbioru leków lub wyprowadzania psa na spacer, należy zwrócić
się o pomoc do znajomych lub krewnych. Alternatywnie, leki można zamówić
przez telefon lub przez Internet. Zakupy również można zamówić przez
Internet. Należy poinformować dostawców, aby pozostawili zakupy na
zewnątrz do obioru, jeśli zostały zamówione przez Internet. Dostawca nie
powinien wchodzić do domu.
Osoby zatrudnione, które nie mogą chodzić do pracy z powodu
koronawirusa, powinny zapoznać się z wytycznymi Ministerstwa Pracy i
Emerytur (z ang. Department for Work and Pensions), aby dowiedzieć się,
jakie wsparcie mogą uzyskać.
Osoby mieszkające z dziećmi
Należy w miarę swoich możliwości zastosować się do niniejszych
wytycznych, chociaż nie wszystkie działania będą możliwe do wykonania.
Z tego, co wiadomo do chwili obecnej wynika, że dzieci wydają się łagodniej
przechodzić zakażenie koronawirusem. Tym niemniej ważne jest jak
najdokładniejsze zastosowanie się do niniejszych wytycznych.
Mieszkając z osobami wymagającymi szczególnej opieki
Należy jak najbardziej ograniczyć czas przebywania członków rodziny
wymagających szczególnej opieki we wspólnych miejscach, takich jak
kuchnie, łazienki i pokoje dzienne, które powinny być właściwe wietrzone.
Nie należy zbliżać się do osób wymagających szczególnej opieki na
odległość bliższą niż 2 metry (3 kroki) i zachęcać je do spania w osobnych
łóżkach, o ile to możliwe. W miarę możliwości powinny one korzystać z innej
łazienki niż reszta domowników. Należy dopilnować, aby korzystały z
oddzielnych ręczników, zarówno do wycierania się po wzięciu kąpieli lub
prysznica, jak i do zachowania właściwej higieny rąk.
W razie korzystania z tej samej łazienki i toalety co osoba wymagająca
szczególnej opieki ważne jest, aby posprzątać je po użyciu (na przykład
wycierając powierzchnie, z którymi miało się kontakt). Kolejną wskazówką
jest ustalenie grafika korzystania z kąpieli. Osoba wymagająca szczególnej
opieki powinna brać kąpiel w pierwszej kolejności.
W razie korzystania z tej samej kuchni co osoba wymagająca szczególnej
opieki należy unikać korzystania z niej w tym samym czasie.
O ile to możliwe, posiłki powinne być przenoszone i spożywane w pokojach.
Należy korzystać ze zmywarki do mycia i suszenia sztućców i naczyń, o ile
jest dostępna. W razie braku suszarki należy je myć, wykorzystując zwykły
płyn do mycia naczyń oraz ciepłą wodę, po czym osuszyć je dokładnie. Jeśli
osoba wymagająca szczególnej opieki korzysta z własnych przyborów
kuchennych, należy używać osobnych ścierek do ich wycierania.
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-employees
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-employees
To zrozumiałe, że niektórym osobom będzie trudno odizolować się od
pozostałych domowników. Należy dokonać wszelkich starań, aby
postępować zgodnie z niniejszymi wytycznymi. Każdy członek gospodarstwa
domowego powinien regularnie myć ręce, unikać dotykania twarzy oraz
czyścić często dotykane powierzchnie.
Karmienie piersią w razie zakażenia
Nie istnieją obecnie dowody sugerujące, że wirus może być przenoszony z
mlekiem matki. Infekcja może zostać przeniesiona na dziecko w taki sam
sposób, jak na każdą inną osobę pozostającą w bliskim kontakcie z osobą
zakażoną. Według obecnych dowodów dzieci z koronawirusem mają
znacznie łagodniejsze objawy niż osoby dorosłe. Korzyści wynikające z
karmienia piersią przewyższają ryzyko przeniesienia wirusa z mlekiem matki
oraz pozostawania w bliskim kontakcie. Jest to jednak indywidualna decyzja,
którą można omówić telefonicznie z położną, pielęgniarką środowiskową lub
lekarzem pierwszego kontaktu.
W razie karmienia mieszanką dla niemowląt lub odciąganym mlekiem matki
należy dokładnie sterylizować sprzęt przed jego użyciem. Nie należy
wymieniać się z nikim butelkami ani odciągaczem pokarmu.
Więcej informacji można znaleźć na na stronie internetowej Royal College of
Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.
Sprzątanie oraz utylizacja śmieci
Do sprzątania należy stosować artykuły gospodarstwa domowego
powszechnego użytku, takie jak detergenty i wybielacze, ponieważ będą
bardzo skuteczne przy usuwaniu wirusów z powierzchni. Należy czyścić
często dotykane powierzchnie, takie jak klamki w drzwiach, poręcze, piloty
oraz blaty stołów. Jest to szczególnie ważne, gdy w domu znajdują się osoby
starsze lub osoby wymagające szczególnej opieki.
Odpady osobiste (takie jak zużyte chusteczki) oraz jednorazowe ściereczki
do czyszczenia powinny być przechowywane bezpiecznie w jednorazowych
workach na śmieci. Worki te powinny być umieszczane w innych workach,
zawiązywane bezpiecznie i przechowywane oddzienie od innych śmieci.
Powinny zostać odstawione na bok na co najmniej 72 godziny przed
umieszczeniem w zwykłym zewnętrznym pojemniku na śmieci.
Inne odpady domowe mągą być utylizowane jak zwykle.
Pranie
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/
Aby zminimalizować możliwość rozprzestrzeniania się wirusa w powietrzu,
nie należy strzepywać brudnych rzeczy do prania.
Należy prać stosownie do okoliczności, zgodnie z zaleceniem producenta.
Wszystkie brudne rzeczy można prać razem.
Jeśli nie ma pralki, należy odczekać dalsze 72 godziny po upływie 7-
dniowego (w przypadku samoizolacji) lub 14-dniowego okresu kwarantanny
(dla gospodarstw domowych) przed zaniesiem prania do pralni
samoobsługowej.
Co można zrobić, aby pomóc sobie w powrocie do zdrowia
Należy pić wodę, aby właściwie się nawadniać. Należy wypijać tyle płynów w
ciągu dnia, aby oddawany mocz był jasnego koloru. Można zażywać leki
sprzedawane bez recepty, takie jak paracetamol, aby złagodzić niektóre
objawy. Leki należy zażywać zgodnie z zaleceniami na opakowaniu lub
etykiecie i nie przekraczać zalecanej dawki.
Zasięganie porady lekarskiej dla samego siebie lub członka rodziny
W razie pogorszenia się stanu zdrowia któregokolwiek z domowników należy
bezzwłocznie zasięgnąć pomocy lekarskiej. Jeśli nie jest to nagły wypadek,
należy skontaktować się z elektronicznie z NHS 111 na stronie internetowej
111.nhs.uk. W razie braku dostępu do Internetu należy skontaktować się
telefonicznie z NHS 111. W nagłych wypadkach należy wezwać karetkę
pogotowia, dzwoniąc pod numer 999 i poinformować operatora o objawach
koronawirusa u siebie lub osoby spokrewnionej.
Wszystkie rutynowe wizyty u lekarza i stomatologa powinny zostać
odwołane, a członkowie rodziny powinni pozostać w domu. W razie
wątpliwości lub konieczności osobistego stawienia się na wizycie w okresie
kwarantanny domowej należy najpierw skontaktować się z wyznaczonym
indywidualnie punktem kontaktu w służbie zdrowia (na przykład lekarzem
pierwszego kontaktu, miejscowym szpitalem lub ambulatorium) pod podanym
numerem telefonu. Jeśli obawy dotyczą doświadczanych objawów
koronawirusa, należy skontaktować się z NHS 111 online. W razie braku
dostępu do Internetu należy skontaktować się telefonicznie z NHS 111.
Należy często myć ręce
Należy utrzymywać ręce w czystości, myjąc je codziennie wodą z mydłem
przez 20 sekund lub używająć środka do dezynfekcji. Pomaga to chronić
https://111.nhs.uk/
samego siebie oraz mieszkające wspólnie osoby. Jest to jedno z
najskuteczniejszych działań obniżających ryzyko przeniesienia infekcji na
inne osoby.
Należy zasłaniać usta i nos podczas kaszlu i kichania
Podczas kaszlu i kichania należy zasłaniać usta i nos jednorazowymi
chusteczkami. Jeśli nie ma ich pod ręką, należy kichać w zgięcie łokcia, nie w
rękę.
Opiekunowie powinni używać chusteczek jednorazowych do wycierania śluzu
lub flegmy po kichaniu lub kaszlu swoich podopiecznych. Następnie powinni
umyć ręce wodą z mydłem.
Chusteczki należy wyrzucać do jednorazowych worków na śmieci i
natychmiast myć ręce wodą z mydłem lub używać środka do dezynfekcji rąk.
Maski ochronne
Nie zalecamy stosowania masek ochronnych jako skutecznego środka
zapobiegającego rozprzestrzenianiu się infekcji. Maski odgrywają ważną rolę
w środowisku klinicznym, takim jak szpitale. Istnieje jednak niewiele
dowodów na korzyści płynące z ich stosowania poza tym środowiskiem.
Nie należy przyjmować gości
Nie należy zapraszać ani wpuszczać do domu gości, np. znajomych lub
innych członków rodziny. Aby porozmawiać z kimś, kto nie jest członkiem
gospodarstwa domowego, należy korzystać z telefonu lub mediów
społecznościowych.
Jeżeli któremukolwiek z członków rodziny zapewniana jest opieka domowa
przez dochodzących opiekunów, nie powinni oni zaprzestawać swoich wizyt.
Opiekunom zostaną zapewnione maski ochronne i rękawiczki, aby obniżyć
ryzyko zakażenia.
Posiadanie zwierząt domowych
W chwili obecniej nie ma dowodów na to, że zwierzęta towarzyszące/domowe, takie
jak psy i koty, mogą zarazić się koronawirusem.
Dbanie o własne samopoczucie podczas pozostawania w domu
Wiadomo, że pozostawanie w domu przez długi okres czasu może być
trudne i irytujące dla niektórych osób. Mogą one czuć się samotne lub
przygnębione, tak jak inni członkowie gospodarstwa domowego. Może
stanowić to szczególne wyzwanie dla osób, które nie mają zbyt dużo miejsca
ani dostępu do ogrodu.
O swój stan psychiczny należy zadbać w takim samym stopniu, jak o ciało, a
w razie potrzeby poprosić o pomoc. Należy utrzymywać kontakt z rodziną i
znajomymi za pomocą telefonu lub mediów społecznościowych. Isnieją
również źródła wsparcia oraz pomocnych informacji, takie jak strona
internetowa Every Mind Matters.
Należy zastanowić się, co można robić podczas pozostawania w domu.
Osoby, które nie mają nic przeciwko pozostawaniu w domu przez tydzień,
starają się być zajęte gotowaniem, czytaniem, nauką w Internecie oraz
oglądaniem filmów. Można wykonywać lekkie ćwiczenia fizyczne w domu lub
w ogrodzie, jeśli pozwala na to stan zdrowia.
Dla wielu osób pomocne okazuje się przypominanie sobie dlaczego to, co
robią, jest takie ważne. Miejmy nadzieję, że u nikogo w waszych rodzinach
nie wystąpią objawy inne niż grypopodobne. Niektóre osoby bywają jednak
poważnie dotknięte koronawirusem, szczególnie osoby starsze, zwłaszcza te
z istniejącymi wcześniej schorzeniami. Pozostając w domu chroni się życie
innych osób i zapobiega przeciążeniu publicznej służby zdrowia.
Zakończenie samoizolacji oraz izolacji wszystkich domowników
Osoby, u których wystąpiły objawy, mogą zakończyć samoizolację po 7
dniach.
Okres 7-dniowej samoizolacji rozpoczyna się pierwszego dnia choroby.
W razie mieszkania z innymi osobami, wszyscy członkowie gospodarstwa
domowego, którzy nie zachorowali, mogą zakończyć kwarantannę domową
po 14 dniach. 14-dniowy okres rozpoczyna się od dnia, kiedy zachorowała
pierwsza osoba. Okres inkubacji wirusa trwa czternaście dni. Osoby, które
będą wciąż zdrowe po 14 dniach najprawdopodobniej nie zostały zakażone.
Jeśli po 7 dniach osoba, która zachorowała pierwsza poczuje się lepiej i nie
będzie mieć wysokiej temperatury, będzie mogła powrócić do codziennych
czynności. Jeśli w ciągu 14-dniowej kwarantanny domowej zachorują inni
członkowie rodziny, powinni postępować według tych samych wytycznych -
tzn. jeśli poczują się lepiej i nie będą mieć wysokiej temperatury po 7 dniach
od wystąpienia objawów, będą mogli powrócić do codziennych czynności.
https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/
https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/
Jeśli u członka gospodarstwa domowego objawy wystąpią pod koniec 14-
dniowego okresu kwarantanny domowej (np. 13 lub 14 dnia) okres izolacji
nie musi być przedłużany, ale osoba z objawami musi pozostać w domu
przez 7 dni.
14-dniowy okres kwarantanny domowej znacznie zredukuje ogólną liczbę
zakażeń, które mogłyby być przenoszone przez domowników. Nie ma
potrzeby wznawiania 14-dniowego okresu kwarantanny dla wszystkich
członków gospodarstwa domowego. Kwarantanna zapewni wysoki poziom
ochrony społeczności lokalnej. Dalsze izolowanie członków danego
gospodarstwa domowego stanowiłoby jedynie nieznaczną dodatkową
ochronę.
Po zakończeniu 14-dniowego okresu kwarantanny każdy domownik, który nie
zachorował może wychodzić z domu.
Jeśli stan zdrowia chorego domownika nie ulega poprawie, a nie zasięgał on
jeszcze porady lekarskiej, należy skontaktować się z NHS 111 online. Jeśli w
domu nie ma dostępu do Internetu, należy zadzwonić pod numer NHS 111.
U niektórych osób kaszel może utrzymywać się przez kilka tygodni, nawet po
wyleczeniu się z wirusa. Kaszel utrzymujący się bez innych objawów nie
oznacza, że należy pozostawać w izolacji przez okres dłuższy niż 7 dni.

COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirements
We face an unprecedented challenge in the weeks and months ahead to provide health and social
care services that meet the needs of people affected by coronavirus (COVID-19).
One of the most important tasks will be to ensure we have the capacity to support people who
have acute healthcare needs in our hospitals. To do this we need to organise the safe and rapid
discharge of those people who no longer need to be in a hospital bed. The new default will be dis-
charge home today.
Strategic Coordination Groups across the NHS, community and social care settings need to ensure
we create and maintain acute bed capacity through faster rates of appropriate discharge from NHS
beds for the foreseeable future.
Today we publish Hospital Discharge Service Requirements, which set out actions that must be
taken immediately to enhance discharge arrangements and the provision of community support.
Each system will tackle this challenge from a different starting position and should take account of
their local workforce and care home/domiciliary care supply dynamics, together with awareness of
the capacity of family carers and volunteers in the community to continue to support local action.
Supporting and sustaining social care will never be more vital to these efforts.
A range of virtual resources and live interactive sessions have been developed to support every
sector to work through how to achieve this new way of operating and are detailed in the document.

Removal of (doffing) personal protective
equipment (PPE) for aerosol generating
procedures (AGPs)
The order of removal of PPE is as follows:
Gloves – the outsides of the gloves are contaminated1
Gown – the front of the gown and sleeves will be contaminated2
Eye protection (preferably a
full-face visor) - the outside will
be contaminated
3
Wash hands
with soap
and water
Respirator – In the absence of an
anteroom/lobby remove FFP3 respirators in
a safe area (e.g., outside the isolation room).
Clean hands with alcohol hand rub.
Do not touch the front of the respirator
as it will be contaminated
4 5
PPE should be removed in an order that
minimises the potential for cross
contamination. Unless there is a dedicated
isolation room with ante room, PPE is to
be removed in as systematic way before
leaving the patient’s room i.e. gloves, then
gown and then eye protection.
The FFP3 respirator must always be
removed outside the patient’s room.
Where possible (dedicated
isolation room with ante room) the
process should be supervised by a
buddy at a distance of 2 metres to
reduce the risk of the healthcare
worker removing PPE and
inadvertently contaminating
themselves while doffing.
The FFP3 respirator should be
removed in the anteroom/lobby. In
the absence of an anteroom/lobby,
remove FFP3 respirator in a safe area
(e.g., outside the isolation room).
All PPE must be disposed of as
healthcare (including clinical) waste.
Firstly: Then:
• grasp the outside
of the glove with
the opposite
gloved hand;
peel off
• hold the removed
glove in gloved
hand
• slide the fingers of
the un-gloved hand
under the remaining
glove at the wrist
• peel the remaining
glove off over the first
glove and discard
Clean hands with
alcohol gel
Unfasten
neck then
waist ties
Pull gown away from the
neck and shoulders,
touching the inside of the
gown only using a peeling
motion as the outside of
the gown will be
contaminated
Turn the gown
inside out, fold or
roll into a bundle
and discard into a
lined waste bin
To remove, use both hands to handle
the retraining straps by pulling away
from behind and discard.

Background
• Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been designated a high consequence
infectious disease (HCID).
• Information on how you can protect yourself can be found here.
• Guidance for healthcare providers who have staff with relevant travel or
contact history can be found here.
• COVID-19 for most individuals causes mild to moderate illness, but in addition
may result in pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection, so patients
could potentially present to primary care settings.
• See further information on COVID-19 for healthcare workers here.
The current national approach is to identify, isolate and contain. In England:
• individual patient advice is being provided by NHS 111
• public information and sampling are being managed by Public Health
England (PHE)
• members of the public who may have COVID-19 and are well enough are
being asked to self-isolate until diagnosis is confirmed
• for confirmed cases, isolation and treatment are being managed by national
specialist treatment centres.
This guidance is applicable in England. Primary care providers operating under
contract to the NHS in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales should refer to
guidance and standard operating procedures (SOPs) produced by the governing
bodies and regulators in their devolved administration.
This guidance is correct at the time of publishing. However, as it is

Generic principles for primary
care settings (community pharmacy,
optical, dental and general medical
care providers)
The collaborative endeavours of the primary care workforce in delivering the national
strategy to identify, isolate and contain COVID-19 are an essential element of the
NHS measures and our national response to the risk presented by COVID-19.
This publication is intended to support primary care teams in the practical
implementation of the PHE evidence-based guidance COVID-19: interim guidance
for primary care. Consistency in adopting the recommended actions will ensure the
safety of our patients, our staff and the population, while maintaining access to
quality healthcare for members of the public in England.
Generic principles for primary care settings and
providers
(See Section 3 for optical practice SOP.)
• Identify potential cases as soon as possible before clinical care is started:
• Prevent potential transmission of infection to other patients and staff.
• Avoid direct physical contact, including physical examination, and exposure
to respiratory and other secretions.
• Isolate the patient and inform NHS 111:
• If unsure whether an individual poses a risk, the default is to isolate at home
or in an isolated area in the practice and call NHS 111, which can seek
clarification with PHE if needed.
• It is preferable for the individual to call NHS 111 on their mobile phone as
this facilitates call back and follow-up contacts if required.
• Practices should designate and prepare a suitable space(s) for
patient/patient group isolation.

• Seek specialist advice: NHS 111 is running a COVID-19 enhanced service that
will be the entry point for all individuals concerned they may meet the case
definition for COVID-19.
• Patients should call NHS 111:
– A possible case of coronavirus needs to meet both the clinical symptoms
and have a travel history, including travel to, or transit through (for any
length of time), the identified risk countries or contact with a confirmed
case of coronavirus.
– PHE has confirmed that if a patient is presenting with symptoms after 14
days, they do not meet the case definition and can be handled as normal.
• Following the NHS 111 assessment, if the patient is calling from an NHS
primary care service provider, NHS 111 will contact the service to advise
them of the next steps and confirm if the caller meets the criteria as a
possible case or not:
– case definition not met – patient to be managed as normal
- NHS 111 will refer patient back for management in primary care
– case definition met – NHS 111 will liaise with the local healthcare
system, advise on isolation and diagnostic testing and arrange safe
transfer of patient from the primary care location in accordance with local
plans.
• Decontamination Once a possible case has been transferred from the primary
care premises, the room where the patient was placed should not be used; the
room door should remain shut, with windows opened and the air conditioning
switched off, until it has been cleaned with detergent and disinfectant. Once this
process has been completed, the room can be put back in use immediately.
Follow the guidance for environmental cleaning after a suspected case; Section 4
of the COVID-19: interim guidance for primary care.
• Points to note:
• There is no change in best practice protocols and compliance with extant
infection protection and control requirement.
• Reception staff do not require personal protective equipment (PPE).
• Practice staff in contact with suspected case are not required to self-isolate
unless directed by a health protection team.1

COVID-19: SOP for primary care
optical practice
This publication is designed to explain the actions an optical practice should take in
managing patients who suspect they may have COVID-19. Revisions to the SOP will
be published in line with any changes in the risk, as notified by PHE.
Practices are to note that for security and information governance nhs.net2 will be
the preferred means for the cascade of information, links to resources, guidance and
notification of amendments/revisions and incident notification.
Patient contact
Most patients presenting in optical practices are unlikely to have COVID-19. If they
have coughs, colds or flu-like symptoms but no relevant (COVID-19) travel or contact
history, then management of their eye care should proceed in line with best practice
and routine management of the cross-infection risks to staff/patients.
Practice staff are to be made aware of this SOP, the current guidance and case
definitions, and need to be able to carry out an initial risk assessment of patient’s
travel/contact history with regards COVID-19.
• A possible case of COVID-19 needs to meet both the clinical symptoms
AND have a travel history, including travel to, or transit through (for any
length of time), the identified risk countries OR contact with a confirmed
case of Coronavirus.
• If a patient is presenting with symptoms after 14 days, they do not meet the
case definition and can be handled as normal.

Patient contact by telephone
For concerned patients contacting the practice by telephone, an accurate travel
history is key to identifying risk of COVID-19 cases.
The gov.uk site should be checked at the beginning of the day to ascertain the most
up to date country travel information.
If the patient answers Yes to any of the following questions:
• Have you been to any of the following Category 1 areas in the last 14 days
(even if you do not have symptoms)?
• Have you travelled to any of the following Category 2 areas in the last 14 days
and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breath (even if it's mild)?
• Have you been in close contact with someone with confirmed coronavirus?
Ask a secondary question:
Have you been advised to self-isolate?
For patients in self-isolation
Patients who are self-isolating for COVID-19 should not be brought into the
practice premises. Patients should contact NHS 111 for further assessment
and referral as necessary to a designated receiving service if the
requirement for care is an emergency.
Defer any appointments for elective care and reinforce self-isolation advice.
Patients in self-isolation seeking advice on urgent care, if care/advice cannot
be provided over the telephone, please ask the patient to call NHS 111.
NHS 111 will triage and assess options for urgent or emergency care and
referral to a designated receiving unit for any COVID-19 cases.
For patients not in self-isolation
Advise patient to contact NHS 111 and seek advice on their symptoms and recent
travel/contact history.
• Ask patient to provide NHS 111 with contact details for the practice.

• An NHS 111 clinician will contact the practice after their assessment to
confirm if case definition not met, patient to be accepted back to practice for
care as usual.
Patients presenting at the practice
On arrival
Make sure patient information posters for NHS settings are displayed so they can be
seen before patients enter the premises. Patient information should be displayed at
reception, by any patient touch screen booking-in, waiting areas and at patient
access points to clinical areas.
Concerned patients with a relevant travel history and meeting the COVID-19 case
definition should be identified when they book in at reception.
Optical practice staff need to be aware of the travel advice on gov.uk and as
necessary should ask patients:
• Have you been to any of the following Category 1 areas in the last 14 days
(even if you do not have symptoms)?
• Have you travelled to any of the following Category 2 areas in the last 14
days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breath (even if it's
mild)?
• Have you been in close contact with someone with confirmed coronavirus?
• Have you been asked to self-isolate?
In the unlikely event that someone presents with suspected COVID-19 and answers
Yes to any of the questions above:
• The default is to advise the patient to return home immediately and call NHS
111.
• An unwell patient with a relevant travel history should be immediately
placed in a room away from other patients and staff and NHS 111 called.
• Invite the patient (and any accompanying family/representative) into the
designated isolation space and advise others not to enter the area/room to
minimise the risk of spreading infection.
• Advise the patient to contact NHS 111 from the designated isolation
area/room:

– The patient will need to state where they are calling from and provide
contact details for the practice.
– While the practice may phone NHS 111 on behalf of the patient, NHS 111
may need to ring the patient back, so the best option is to advise the
patient to use their own mobile phone if they have one.
• The NHS 111 clinician will contact the practice after their assessment to
advise on whether the patient meets the case definition and provide advice
on next steps, which may be:
– case definition not met and routine care in practice may be resumed
– case definition met: maintain isolation in current location pending transfer
to defined destination.
While waiting for advice from NHS 111, establish a routine for regular
communication with the patient/patient group. This may necessitate contact via
remote means or simply a knock and conversation through the closed door.
If entry to the room or contact with the patient is unavoidable in an emergency, wear
personal protective equipment (PPE) in line with standard infection control
precautions, such as disposable gloves, disposable apron and fluid-resistant surgical
mask (FRSM – see below) and keep exposure to a minimum. PPE supplies may be
obtained from the NHS Supply Chain. All PPE in full should be disposed of as clinical
waste. See PHE COVID-19: interim guidance for primary care
If the patient becomes critically ill and requires an urgent ambulance transfer to a
hospital, the practice is to contact 999 and inform the ambulance call handler of the
concerns. The patient and any accompanying family should be asked to remain in
the isolation room and the door closed. Advise others not to enter the room.
Note: A disposable fluid-resistant face mask (FRSM) is
worn over the nose and mouth to protect the mucous
membranes of the wearer’s nose and mouth from
splashes and infectious droplets and also to protect
patients.
When recommended for infection control
purposes a 'surgical face mask' typically denotes a fluid-
resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask.

During consultation
If COVID-19 is considered possible when an appointment is already in progress,
assess a suitable and safe point to bring the consultation to a close, withdraw from
the room, close the door and wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.
Advise the patient to contact NHS 111 from the isolated consulting room.
While the practice may phone NHS 111 on behalf of the patient, NHS 111 may need
to ring the patient back, so the best option is to advise the patient to use their own
mobile phone if they have one.
NHS 111 clinicians will assess the case and advise on next steps, including:
• case definition not met and routine care in practice may be resumed
• case definition met: maintain isolation in current location pending transfer to
defined destination
• if the patient is critically ill or requires emergency medical care, an
ambulance should be requested and the 999 call handler informed of
COVID-19 risk
• if a healthcare professional is required to enter the room to offer assistance
or support the 999 assessment, they should wear disposable gloves,
disposable plastic aprons and fluid-resistant surgical face masks. See PHE
COVID-19 interim guidance for primary care
During a domiciliary visit
If suspected COVID-19 is identified before a domiciliary visit, patients should be
advised to contact NHS 111 for further assessment.
If suspected COVID-19 is identified during a domiciliary visit, staff should ensure
they have the patient’s (or carer’s) telephone number. Staff should then withdraw
from the room, close the door and wash hands thoroughly with soap and water.
Further communication should be via telephone. The patient (or carer) should then
call NHS 111 for further assessment.

If suspected COVID-19 is identified during a care home visit, in addition to
contacting NHS 111, please inform the local health protection team to discuss
possible case contacts, decontamination processes and any further action required.
If the patient needs emergency medical care, a healthcare professional should use
personal protective equipment (apron, gloves and fluid-repellant surgical face mask)
and provide treatment. An ambulance should be requested, and the 999 call-handler
informed of COVID-19 risk.

Post-transfer actions
Once a possible case has been transferred from the practice premises, unless
directed otherwise:
• The room or isolation area where the patient was placed should not be used,
the room door should remain shut, area cordoned off, with windows opened
and the air conditioning switched off, until it has been cleaned with detergent
and disinfectant.
• If a suspected case spent time in a communal area – for example, a waiting
area or toilet facilities – then these areas should be cleaned with detergent
and disinfectant as soon as practicably possible unless there has been a
blood or body fluid spill, which should be dealt with immediately.
• Details of how to decontaminate are contained in PHE COVID-19 interim
guidance for primary care.
• Once cleaning and disinfection have been completed, the area can be put
back in use.
• The usual PPE equipment and protocols apply when cleaning and
disinfecting; HAZMAT equipment is not required. Disposable gloves and
disposable aprons should be available in the practice as part of the routine
cleaning, disinfection and decontamination PPE. Staff should follow the
usual cleaning routine and COSH Guidance.
• All waste from suspected contaminated areas should be removed from the
room and quarantined until patient test results are known (this may take 48
hours); if the patient is confirmed to have COVID-19 further advice should be
sought from the local health protection team. Details of your local health
protection team can be found at www.gov.uk/health-protection-team
• Remove and discard PPE as clinical waste.
• It is the responsibility of the primary care provider to supply cleaning
materials and PPE for staff and to ensure their staff are appropriately
trained, have access to equipment and have arrangements in place for
disposal of clinical waste.
• Practice staff who have been in contact with suspected cases are not
required to self-isolate unless directed otherwise by the health protection
team.

Preparation guidance
To underpin practice resilience and continuity of service while protecting your
patients, practice staff and the public, the following practical steps are
recommended.
Appoint a COVID-19 lead for the in-practice co-ordination of activities, training,
preparation and implementation of this SOP and any subsequent revisions to
guidance.
It is recommended that the practice establishes a daily routine updating practice staff
with respect to travel advice on gov.uk:
• Category 1 areas
• Category 2 areas
Communication and information
The Central Alerting System (CAS) will continue to be used to communicate urgent
updates. Practices are reminded to ensure they have followed registration guidance
provided by MHRA to use a generic email, as such accounts can be used by more
than one person to maintain continuity of service at times when an individual is
absent. For practices that have yet to register, please email MHRA CAS at
safetyalerts@mhra.gov.uk.
COVID-19 information will also be sent directly to your premises specific NHS Mail
account by the NHS England and NHS Improvement Regional Team.
• Practices that have yet to set up an nhs.net account should go to the NHS
registration website where you will be guided through the short process.
• Please ensure this account is closely monitored for new information.
Practices should ensure auto forward for emails to an alternative nhs.net
account and designated deputy in the event of user absence.

Preparation of practice accommodation
• Identify at least one suitable space/room in the practice for patient/patient
group isolation.
–
If there is no suitable isolation room, identify an isolated area within the
practice that can be cordoned off for the use of the patient/patient group,
which maintains a 2-metre space from other patients and staff.
– Declutter and remove non-essential furnishings and items: this will assist
if decontamination is required post-patient transfer.
– If possible, retain a telephone in the room/space for patient contact with
NHS 111.
– Place a card/sign in the isolation room/area with practice contact details,
e-mail, telephone numbers, practice location and post code and include
the name of the lead clinician in attendance (this information is to be
available to the patient when they contact NHS 111).
• All staff are briefed on the potential use of the room/area and actions
required in the event that it is necessary to vacate room/area at short notice.
• Identify toilet facilities that will be designated for the sole use of patients
while in isolation.
• Prepare appropriate space/room signage to be used if the space/room is
occupied, and for the toilet facilities.
• Prepare a patient ‘support pack’ (to be held in reserve) that may include
items such as bottled water, disposable cups/cutlery, disposable tissues,
clinical waste bag, fluid-resistant surgical mask.
• Review the isolation space/area and consider the options for carrying out
regular checks on the general welfare of the isolated patient/patient group.
This may be simply a knock and conversation through the closed door or
could be verbal and/or visual contact via remote means eg telephone,
Skype/FaceTime, practice intercom, baby monitor.
Practice preparation for incident management
Practices may wish to draw on their existing protocols for dealing with medical
emergencies in practice. The incident management principles are the same:
• Develop and rehearse the PHE COVID-19 triage protocols and isolation
procedures:
– agree practice approach for each stage of the potential scenarios
Version 1.1 OPTICAL PUBLICATION
5 March 2020
Version 1.1 OPTICAL PUBLICATION
5 March 2020
page 14
– confirm role and responsibilities for each member of staff
– appoint an incident manager
– confirm lead for discussions with patients/NHS 111
– prepare an aide-memoire for staff (using guidance in Section 3)
– rehearse practice response.
• Review the practice protocols for decontamination from patients who have
potentially infectious conditions. These protocols, PPE, training and
materials are extant contractual and regulatory requirements.3,4
• Anticipate impacts on practice schedule/daily routine:
– Practices are advised to consider the likelihood (which is currently low)
and the risk of disruption to the appointments scheduled for the day.
– Review the practice’s business continuity plan.
• Domiciliary - ensure that ‘home visit’ bags have necessary additional PPE
and clinical waste bags in case a patient with suspected coronavirus is
identified on a home visit.

NHS England and NHS Improvement
5 March 2020
This is the first of a series of regular updates to general practice regarding the
emerging COVID-19 situation
Dear colleagues
I recognise that COVID-19 is placing a new and increasing challenge on already
busy practices, and this will be an area of concern for you, your teams and your
patients.
I would like to reassure you that we are continually refining our plans for this
outbreak, working with our key partners, and drawing on lessons learned from
previous incidents and listening to feedback received on emerging COVID-19 issues.
In this letter, I would like to update you on what is happening, and share some key
resources and how we plan to communicate with you.
As part of our preparedness plans, we will have advice and plans in place to
prioritise work to help manage increased pressure on the workforce, models to
care for vulnerable and self-isolating members of the public and staff, and
approaches to temporarily increase workforce capacity. Further details of these
arrangements will be announced as required.
What is happening?
It is important that you are kept safe and informed during this period. You can find
the latest guidance for keeping yourself safe and well here:
www.gov.uk/government/collections/wuhan-novel-coronavirus
We have recently published standard operating procedures for primary care:
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/. Please can you read through
these and take the actions requested. Public Health England has also issued interim
advice for primary care which you can also find on our website:
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
An initial stock of protective kit (PPE) for each practice, including 400 general use
aprons, 300 pairs of examination gloves and 300 fluid repellent face masks will be
issued early next week to all practices. Larger surgeries will receive repeat deliveries
to ensure they have sufficient amounts.
Major regulators have issued guidance to support health professionals in these
challenging circumstances, encouraging partnership working, flexibility and operating
in line with the best available guidance. You can read the statement here:
https://www.nmc.org.uk/news/news-and-updates/how-we-will-continue-to-regulate-
in-light-of-novel-coronavirus/ The Care Quality Commission is also working closely

https://www.nmc.org.uk/news/news-and-updates/how-we-will-continue-to-regulate-in-light-of-novel-coronavirus/
with NHS England and NHS Improvement and writing to providers today outlining
their plans.
We would like to encourage all practices to check their business continuity plans
(BCPs) and identify specific roles and actions that could support practices with
managing local demand. Ensuring your BCPs are common with your neighbours
(primary care network, neighbourhood or CCG) will allow additional support if
needed.
Changes to online booking: To mitigate any risk that potentially infected patients
book appointments online and attend the practice when they should be receiving
advice to self-isolate or go through testing, all practices are now being advised to
change face-to-face appointments booked online to triage appointments via
telephone or video. You can read more on our website:
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
Prescriptions: Practices should not change their repeat prescription durations or
support patients trying to stockpile: these actions may put a strain on the supply
chain and exacerbate any potential shortages. Practices should consider putting all
suitable patients on electronic repeat dispensing as soon as possible. The whole
repeatable prescription can be valid for a year but each repeat should be for no
longer than the patient has now. For example, if the patient has prescriptions for a
month’s supply now then the repeat dispensing should be set up as 13 x 28 days’
supply.
Useful resources
You can download the latest materials to display to the public on our website:

If you need any COVID-19 specific public health advice which is not already
covered in published guidance, please contact your Local Health Protection Unit or
your local commissioner.
How we plan to communicate with you
1. Urgent messages: Central Alerting System:
• For urgent patient safety communications, we will contact you through the Central
Alerting System (CAS).
• Please ensure you have registered to receive CAS alerts directly from the MHRA:
https://www.cas.mhra.gov.uk/Register.aspx
Practice action: Please use a generic practice email account, not a personal one.
For continuity of access, ideally use an nhs.net email account – it’s more secure.
Please register a mobile phone number for emergency communications.
2. At less urgent times: Commissioner’s cascade:
• For less urgent COVID-19 communications we will email you through your local
commissioner.
Practice action: Please share a dedicated nhs.net COVID-19 generic practice email
with your commissioner to receive communications and also share this email with
your local medical committee. In the event of user absence, practices should ensure
auto forward for emails to an alternative nhs.net account and designated deputy.

1. Introduction
This document outlines the infection prevention and control advice for healthcare workers
involved in receiving, assessing and caring for patients who are a possible or confirmed case of
COVID-19.
It is based on the best evidence available from previous pandemic and inter-
pandemic periods and focuses on the infection prevention and control aspects of this disease
only, recognising that a preparedness plan will consider other counter measures.
The infection prevention and control advice in this document is considered good practice in
response to this COVID-19 pandemic.
N.B. The emerging evidence base on COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. Further updates may
be made to this guidance as new detail or evidence emerges.
1.1 Scope and purpose
This document provides guidance and information on infection prevention and control
procedures to inform and advise local healthcare planning for COVID-19. This guidance has
been written for the NHS, but the infection prevention and control principles apply to other
settings where healthcare is delivered. It is issued jointly by the Department of Health and
Social Care (DHSC), Public Health Wales (PHW), Public Health Agency (PHA) Northern
Ireland, Health Protection Scotland (HPS) and Public Health England as official guidance.
Whilst this guidance seeks to ensure a consistent and resilient UK wide approach, some
differences in operational details and organisational responsibilities may apply in Northern
Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland.

2. Transmission characteristics of COVID-
19 and principles of infection prevention
and control
2.1 Routes of transmission
Infection control advice is based on the reasonable assumption that the transmission
characteristics of COVID-19 are similar to those of the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak. The initial
phylogenetic and immunologic similarities between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV can be
extrapolated to gain insight into some of the epidemiological characteristics. The transmission
of COVID-19 is thought to occur mainly through respiratory droplets generated by coughing and
sneezing, and through contact with contaminated surfaces.1
The predominant modes of
transmission are assumed to be droplet and contact.
For SARS-CoV, there is limited evidence
from observational studies showing a protective effect of up to 80% of masks and N95
respirators (the US equivalent of UK FFP2 respirators) used by healthcare workers however the
evidence base is sparse and indications (and compliance) for mask/respirator use in these
studies varied.2 It should be noted that N95 respirators are not recommended for use in UK
healthcare settings. In the UK, FFP3 respirators should be worn for airborne precautions and
must be compliant with BS EN149:200.1 For SARS-CoV, evidence suggests that use of both
respirators and surgical face masks offer a similar level of protection, both associated with up to
an 80% reduction in risk of infection.2 During AGPs there is an increased risk of aerosol spread
of infectious agents irrespective of the mode of transmission (contact, droplet, or airborne)
(Section 6.5 AGPs), and airborne precautions must be implemented when performing AGPs,
including those carried out on a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.
In light of the above, the Department of Health and Social Care’s New and Emerging
Respiratory Virus Threat Assessment Group (NERVTAG) have recommended that airborne
precautions should be implemented at all times in clinical areas considered AGP ‘hot spots’ e.g.
Intensive Care Units (ICU), Intensive Therapy Units (ITU) or High Dependency Units (HDU) that
are managing COVID-19 patients (unless patients are isolated in a negative pressure isolation
room/or single room, where only staff entering the room need wear a respirator).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 8 of 49
In other areas a fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask (FRSM) is recommended; all general
ward staff, community, ambulance and social care staff should wear an FRSM for close patient
contact (within 1 metre), unless performing an AGP, when a filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3)
respirator, eye protection, a disposable long sleeved gown and gloves should be worn.
Initial research has identified the presence of live COVID-19 virus in the stools and conjunctival
secretions of confirmed cases.1
All secretions (except sweat) and excretions, including
diarrhoeal stools from patients with known or suspected COVID-19, should be regarded as
potentially infectious.
2.2 Incubation and infectious period
Assessment of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 cases suggests
that, similar to SARS-CoV, patients will not be infectious until the onset of symptoms.
In most
cases, individuals are usually considered infectious while they have symptoms; how infectious
individuals are, depends on the severity of their symptoms and stage of their illness. The median
time from symptom onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately 2 weeks and is 3-6
weeks for severe or critical cases.3
There have been case reports that suggest infectivity
during the asymptomatic period, with one patient found to be shedding virus before the onset of
symptoms.4
Further study is required to determine the actual occurrence and impact of
asymptomatic transmission.
Precautions in section 5: Standard Infection Control Precautions (SICPs) and section 6:
Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs) should remain in place until symptoms resolve.
From international data, the balance of evidence is that infectivity has significantly reduced 7
days after the onset of symptoms.
2.3 Survival in the environment
In light of limited data for SARS-CoV-2, evidence was assessed from studies conducted with
previous human coronaviruses including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Human coronaviruses
can survive on inanimate objects and can remain viable for up to 5 days at temperatures of 22-
25°C and relative humidity of 40-50% (which is typical of air-conditioned indoor environments).1
Survival on environmental surfaces is also dependent on the surface type.1
An experimental
study using a SARS-CoV-2 strain reported viability on plastic for up to 72 hours, for 48 hours on
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 9 of 49
stainless steel and up to 8 hours on copper.1 Viability was quantified by end-point titration on
Vero E6 cells. Extensive environmental contamination may occur following an aerosol
generating procedure (AGP). The rate of clearance of aerosols in an enclosed space is
dependent on the extent of any mechanical/natural ventilation – the greater the number of air
changes per hour (ventilation rate), the sooner any aerosol will be cleared.5 The time required
for clearance of aerosols, and thus the time after which the room can be entered without a
filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirator, can be determined by the number of air changes
per hour (ACH) as outlined in WHO guidance; in general wards and single rooms there should
be a minimum of 6 air changes per hour, in negative-pressure isolation rooms there should be
a minimum of 12 air changes per hour.6 Where feasible, environmental
decontamination
should be performed when it is considered appropriate to enter the room/area without an FFP3
respirator. A single air change is estimated to remove 63% of airborne contaminants, after 5 air
changes less than 1% of airborne contamination is thought to remain.7 A minimum of 20
minutes i.e. 2 air changes, in hospital settings where the majority of these procedures occur is
considered pragmatic.
The precautions described in section 5.2: Hand hygiene and section 6.6: Management of
patient care environment and equipment should be followed.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 10 of 49
3. Organisational preparedness for
preventing and controlling COVID-19
Limiting transmission of COVID-19 in the healthcare setting requires a range of infection
prevention and control measures which can be considered as a hierarchy of controls.
Administrative controls are implemented at an organisational level (e.g. the design and use of
appropriate processes, systems and engineering controls, and provision and use of suitable
work equipment and materials) to help prevent the introduction of infection and to control and
limit the transmission of infection in healthcare. The control of exposure at source, including
adequate ventilation systems and effective environmental decontamination will physically
reduce exposure to infection. Employers are under a legal obligation – under control of
substances hazardous to health (COSHH) – to adequately control the risk of exposure to
hazardous substances where exposure cannot be prevented. The provision and use of personal
protective equipment (PPE), including respiratory protective equipment (RPE), will protect staff,
patients and visitors. Employees have an obligation to make full and proper use of any control
measures, including PPE, provided by their employer. The principles below are listed as a
hierarchy of infection prevention and control measures at a local hospital/ward level. (Note that
this list is not exhaustive but includes key principles and illustrates a useful approach to
preventing and controlling COVID-19).
Hierarchy of Control measures:
● Early recognition/reporting of cases;
● Early assessment/triaging of cases;
● Implementing control measures, including:
– maintaining separation in space and/or time between suspected and confirmed
COVID-19 patients,
– educating staff, patients and visitors about Standard infection control precautions
(SICPs) and Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs),
– prompt implementation of TBPs to limit transmission,
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 11 of 49
– restricting access of ill visitors to the facility,
– instructing staff members with symptoms to stay at home and not come to work until
symptoms resolve,
– planning and implementation of strategies for surge capacity.
In preparedness for implementing these control measures all healthcare organisations should
undertake planning, and test the preparedness response for the various phases of a pandemic.
This includes:
● An assessment of their facilities’ current capabilities. Healthcare services will not be able
to operate under ‘business as usual’ during a COVID-19 pandemic. An assessment of
the practical ability to deliver care and implement control measures under the pressure
of an exceptional number of patient admissions and reduced staff numbers due to illness
must be assessed; ensuring their facilities’ most current blueprints are readily available
and accessible if needed to make necessary changes;
● An assessment of the current workforce;
● Working in a multidisciplinary team with healthcare and social care leaders/managers,
engineering, and clinical staff to plan for segregation of patients and/or services and
creation of adequate isolation rooms; identifying potential areas that could be converted
effectively with minimum modifications; and
● Defining engineering, administrative, and personnel requirements that can be efficiently
implemented during a pandemic COVID-19 event.8

4. Infection prevention and control
precautions
Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission based precautions (TBPs)
must be used when managing patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
4.1 Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) definition
Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) are the basic infection prevention and control
measures necessary to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious agents from both
recognised and unrecognised sources. Sources include blood and other body fluids, secretions
and excretions (excluding sweat), non-intact skin or mucous membranes, and any equipment or
items in the care environment. SICPs should be used by all staff, in all care settings, at all
times, for all patients.
4.2 Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs) definition
Transmission based precautions (TBPs) are applied when SICPs alone are insufficient to
prevent cross transmission of an infectious agent. TBPs are additional infection control
precautions required when caring for a patient with a known or suspected infectious agent.
TBPs are categorised by the route of transmission of the infectious agent:
4.3 Routes of transmission:
● Contact precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission via direct
contact or indirectly from the immediate care environment (including care equipment).
This is the most common route of infection transmission.
● Droplet precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission over short
distances via droplets (>5μm) from the respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a
mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory
system to above the alveolar level. The maximum distance for cross transmission from
droplets has not been definitively determined, although a distance of approximately
1 metre (3 feet) around the infected individual has frequently been reported in the
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 13 of 49
medical literature as the area of risk.7, 9
● Airborne precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission without
necessarily having close contact via aerosols (≤5μm) from the respiratory tract of one
individual directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Aerosols
penetrate the respiratory system to the alveolar level.
Interrupting transmission of COVID-19 requires both droplet and contact precautions; if an
aerosol generating procedure (AGP) is being undertaken then airborne precautions are
required in addition to contact precautions.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.

5. Standard infection control precautions
(SICPs)
5.1 Patient placement/assessment for infection risk
Patients must be promptly assessed for infection risk on arrival at the care area and, if possible,
prior to accepting a patient from another care area. Patients should be continuously reviewed
throughout their inpatient stay. In all healthcare settings, patients with symptoms of COVID-19
should be segregated from non-symptomatic patients as promptly as possible.
5.2 Hand hygiene
Hand hygiene is essential to reduce the transmission of infection in health and other care settings
and is a critical element of standard infection control precautions (SICPs). All staff, patients and
visitors should decontaminate their hands with alcohol based hand rub (ABHR) when entering
and leaving areas where care for –suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients is being
delivered.
Hand hygiene must be performed immediately before every episode of direct patient care and
after any activity or contact that potentially results in hands becoming contaminated, including
the removal of personal protective equipment (PPE), equipment decontamination and waste
handling: https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Your_5_Moments_For_Hand_Hygiene_Poster.pdf
Before performing hand hygiene:
● expose forearms (bare below the elbows);
● remove all hand and wrist jewellery (a single, plain metal finger ring is permitted but
should be removed (or moved up) during hand hygiene);
● ensure finger nails are clean, short and that artificial nails or nail products are not worn;
● cover all cuts or abrasions with a waterproof dressing.
https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Your_5_Moments_For_Hand_Hygiene_Poster.pdf
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 15 of 49
Technique for hand washing and rubbing
● Hand hygiene includes the use of ABHR for routine hand hygiene and hand washing with
soap and water, including thorough drying, if hands are visibly soiled or dirty.
● The technique for hand washing must be carried out thoroughly and for a time period
sufficient to inactivate the virus i.e. 40 to 60 seconds. See Appendix 1 – Best practice
how to hand wash.
● ABHR must be available for all staff as near to point of care as possible, where this is not
practical, personal dispensers should be used. The technique for use of ABHR to
decontaminate hands must be carried out thoroughly and for a time period sufficient to
inactivate the virus i.e. 20 to 30 seconds. See Appendix 2.
● Where no running water is available or hand hygiene facilities are lacking, such as in a
patient’s home, staff may use hand wipes followed by ABHR and should wash their
hands at the first available opportunity.
5.3 Respiratory and cough hygiene – ‘Catch it, bin it, kill it’
Patients, staff and visitors should be encouraged to minimise potential COVID-19 transmission
through good respiratory hygiene measures:
● Disposable, single-use tissues should be used to cover the nose and mouth when
sneezing, coughing or wiping and blowing the nose. Used tissues should be disposed of
promptly in the nearest waste bin.
● Tissues, waste bins (lined and foot operated) and hand hygiene facilities should be
available for patients, visitors and staff.
● Hands should be cleaned (using soap and water if possible, otherwise using ABHR) after
coughing, sneezing, using tissues or after any contact with respiratory secretions and
contaminated objects.
● Encourage patients to keep hands away from the eyes, mouth and nose.
● Some patients (e.g. the elderly and children) may need assistance with containment of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 16 of 49
respiratory secretions; those who are immobile will need a container (e.g. a plastic bag)
readily at hand for immediate disposal of tissues.
● In common waiting areas or during transportation, symptomatic patients may wear a
fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical face mask (FRSM), if tolerated, to minimise the
dispersal of respiratory secretions and reduce environmental contamination.
5.4 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Before undertaking any procedure, staff should assess any likely exposure and ensure PPE is
worn that provides adequate protection against the risks associated with the procedure or task
being undertaken. All staff should be trained in the proper use of all PPE that they may be
required to wear.
In addition:
● Staff who have had and recovered from COVID-19 should continue to follow infection
control precautions, including the PPE recommended in this document.
All PPE should be:
● compliant with the relevant BS/EN standards (European technical standards as adopted
in the UK);
● located close to the point of use;
● stored to prevent contamination in a clean/dry area until required for use (expiry dates
must be adhered to);
● single-use only;
● changed immediately after each patient and/or following completion of a procedure or task;
and
● disposed of after use into the correct waste stream i.e. healthcare/clinical waste (this may
require disposal via orange or yellow bag waste; local guidance will be provided depending
on the impact of the disease)
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 17 of 49
5.4.1 Disposable apron/gown
Disposable plastic aprons must be worn to protect staff uniform or clothes from contamination
when providing direct patient care and during environmental and equipment decontamination.
Fluid-resistant gowns must be worn when a disposable plastic apron provides inadequate cover
of staff uniform or clothes for the procedure/task being performed and when there is a risk of
extensive splashing of blood and/or other body fluids e.g. during aerosol generating procedures
(AGPs). If non fluid-resistant gowns are used, a disposable plastic apron should be worn
underneath.
Disposable aprons and gowns must be changed between patients and immediately after
completion of a procedure/task.
5.4.2 Disposable gloves
Disposable gloves must be worn when providing direct patient care and when exposure to
blood and/or other body fluids is anticipated/likely, including during equipment and
environmental decontamination. Gloves must be changed immediately following the care
episode or the task undertaken.
5.4.3 Eye protection/Face visor
Eye/face protection should be worn when there is a risk of contamination to the eyes from
splashing of secretions (including respiratory secretions), blood, body fluids or excretions. An
individual risk assessment should be carried out prior to/at the time of providing care.
Disposable, single-use, eye/face protection is recommended.
Eye/face protection can be achieved by the use of any one of the following:
● surgical mask with integrated visor;
● full face shield/visor;
● polycarbonate safety spectacles or equivalent;
Regular corrective spectacles are not considered adequate eye protection.
See Appendix 3 for the correct order of donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 18 of 49
5.5 Safe management of linen (laundry)
No special procedures are required; linen is categorised as ‘used’ or ‘infectious’. All linen used
in the direct care of patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 should be managed as
‘infectious’ linen. Linen must be handled, transported and processed in a manner that prevents
exposure to the skin and mucous membranes of staff, contamination of their clothing and the
environment:
Disposable gloves and an apron should be worn when handling infectious linen.
All linen should be handled inside the patient room/cohort area. A laundry receptacle should be
available as close as possible to the point of use for immediate linen deposit.
When handling linen do not:
● rinse, shake or sort linen on removal from beds/trolleys;
● place used/infectious linen on the floor or any other surfaces e.g. a locker/table top;
● re-handle used/infectious linen once bagged;
● overfill laundry receptacles; or
● place inappropriate items in the laundry receptacle e.g. used equipment/needles.
When managing infectious linen:
● place directly into a water-soluble/alginate bag and secure;
● place the water-soluble bag inside a clear polythene bag and secure;
● place the polythene bag into in the appropriately coloured (as per local policy) linen bag
(hamper).
All linen bags/receptacles must be tagged e.g. ward/care area and date. Store all
used/infectious linen in a designated, safe, lockable area whilst awaiting uplift. Organisational
preparedness plans should consider the safe storage of excess linen awaiting collection and for
maintaining supplies of clean linen for patient use.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 19 of 49
5.6 Staff uniforms/clothes
The appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) will protect staff uniform from
contamination in most circumstances. Healthcare facilities should provide changing
rooms/areas where staff can change into uniforms on arrival at work.
Organisations may consider the use of theatre scrubs for staff who do not usually wear a
uniform but who are likely to come into close contact with patients e.g. medical staff.
Healthcare laundry services should be used to launder staff uniforms. If there is no laundry
facility available, then uniforms should be transported home in a disposable plastic bag. This
bag should be disposed of into the household waste stream.
Uniforms should be laundered:
● separately from other household linen;
● in a load not more than half the machine capacity;
● at the maximum temperature the fabric can tolerate, then ironed or tumbled-dried.
NB. It is best practice to change into and out of uniforms at work and not wear them when
travelling; this is based on public perception rather than evidence of an infection risk. This does
not apply to community health workers who are required to travel between patients in the same
uniform.
5.7 Management of blood and body fluid spills
Spillages must be decontaminated in line with local policy. For an example, see Appendix 4.
5.8 Management of healthcare (including clinical) and non-clinical waste
Large volumes of waste may be generated by frequent use of PPE; advice from the local waste
management team should be sought prospectively on how to manage this.
Dispose of all waste as clinical waste.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 20 of 49
Waste from a possible or a confirmed case must be disposed of as Category B waste. The
transport of Category B waste is described in Health Technical Memorandum 07-01: Safe
management of healthcare waste. Disposal of all waste related to possible or confirmed cases
should be classified as infectious clinical waste suitable for alternative treatment, unless the
waste has other properties that would require it to be incinerated.
6. Transmission based precautions (TBPs)
for pandemic COVID-19
In addition to standard infection control precautions (SICPs), droplet precautions should be used
for patients known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19 in all healthcare settings.
● COVID-19 virus is expelled as droplets from the respiratory tract of an infected individual
(e.g. during coughing and sneezing) directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctiva of a
susceptible individual(s) or environmental surface(s).
● Droplets travel only short distances through the air; a distance of at least 1 metre has
been used for deploying droplet precautions.
However, this distance should be
considered as the minimum rather than an absolute:
● Transmission based precautions (TBPs (droplet) should be continued until the resolution
of the patient’s fever and respiratory symptoms.
6.1 Duration of precautions
Patients should remain in isolation/cohort with TBPs applied until the resolution of fever and
respiratory symptoms. The duration of TBPs may require modification based on the intelligence
gathered about COVID-19.
Patients can be discharged before resolution of symptoms provided they are deemed clinically
fit for discharge and should be advised to self-isolate as per staying at home guidance.
Discharge to long term care facilities should be discussed and agreed locally.
The decision to modify the duration of, or ‘stand down’ TBPs should be made by the clinical

COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 21 of 49
team managing the patient(s); based on patient condition and in agreement with the local
Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT).
6.2 Segregation and cohorting (inpatient settings)
6.2.1 Negative pressure isolation rooms
Special environmental controls, such as negative pressure isolation rooms, are not necessary
to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. However, in the early stages, and in high risk
settings, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may be isolated in negative pressure
rooms.
6.2.2 Single rooms
Wherever possible, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed in single
rooms. In an escalating situation there is however likely to be a lack of single rooms/isolation
facilities.
Where single/isolation rooms are in short supply, and cohorting is not yet considered
possible (patient(s) awaiting laboratory confirmation), prioritise patients who have excessive
cough and sputum production for single/isolation room placement.
Single rooms in COVID-19 segregated areas should, wherever possible, be reserved for
performing aerosol generating procedures (AGPs).
Single rooms in non-COVID-19 areas should be reserved for patients requiring isolation for
other (non-influenza-like illness) reasons.
The prioritising of patients for isolation other than suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients
should be decided locally, based on patient need and local resources.
6.2.3 Cohort areas
If a single/isolation room is not available, cohort confirmed respiratory infected patients with
other patients confirmed to have COVID-19. Ensure patients are physically separated; a
distance of at least 1 metre. Use privacy curtains between the beds to minimise opportunities
for close contact. Where possible, a designated self-contained area or wing of the healthcare
facility should be used for the treatment and care of patients with COVID-19. This area should:
● include a reception area that is separate from the rest of the facility and should, if
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 22 of 49
feasible, have a separate entrance/exit from the rest of the building;
● not be used as a thoroughfare by other patients, visitors or staff, including patients being
transferred, staff going for meal breaks, and staff and visitors entering and exiting the
building;
● be separated from non-segregated areas by closed doors; and
● have signage displayed warning of the segregated area to control entry.
Hospitals should consider creating cohort areas which differentiate the level of care required.
It
may also be prudent to consider:
● the need for cohorting in single/mixed sex wards/bays
● underlying patient condition (immunocompromised);
● age groups when cohorting children; and
● routine childhood vaccination status when cohorting children.
6.2.4 Staff cohorting
Assigning a dedicated team of staff to care for patients in isolation/cohort rooms/areas is an
additional infection control measure. This should be implemented whenever there are sufficient
levels of staff available (so as not to have a negative impact on non-affected patients’ care).
Staff who have had confirmed COVID-19 and recovered should continue to follow the infection
control precautions, including personal protective equipment (PPE), as outlined in this
document (see section 7).
6.2.5 Visitors to segregated/cohort areas
Visitors to all areas of the healthcare facility should be restricted to essential visitors only, such
as parents of paediatric patients or an affected patient’s main carer. Local risk assessment and
practical management should be considered, ensuring this is a pragmatic and proportionate
response, including the consideration of whether there is a requirement for visitors to wear PPE
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 23 of 49
or respiratory protective equipment (RPE).
Visiting may be suspended if considered appropriate. All visitors entering a segregated/cohort
area must be instructed on hand hygiene. They must not visit any other care area.
Signage to support restrictions is critical. Visitors with COVID-19 symptoms must not enter the
healthcare facility. Visitors who are symptomatic should be encouraged to leave and must not
be permitted to enter areas where there are immunocompromised patients.
6.3 Patient transfers and transport
6.3.1 Intra-hospital transfers:
● The movement and transport of patients from their single room/cohort area should be
limited to essential purposes only. Staff at the receiving destination must be informed
that the patient has or is suspected to have COVID-19.
● If transport/movement is necessary, consider offering the patient a fluid-resistant (Type
IIR) surgical mask (FRSM) to be worn during transportation, to minimise the dispersal of
respiratory droplets when this can be tolerated.
● Patients must be taken straight to and returned from clinical departments and must not
wait in communal areas. If possible, patients should be placed at the end of clinical lists.
6.3.2 Transfer from primary care/community settings:
● If transfer from a primary care facility or community setting to hospital is required, the
ambulance service should be informed of the infectious status of the patient.
● Staff of the receiving ward/department should be notified in advance of any transfer and
must be informed that the patient has or is suspected to have COVID-19.
6.3.3 Inter-hospital transfers:
● Patient transfer from one healthcare facility to another should be avoided; transfer may
be undertaken if medically necessary for specialist care arising out of complications or
concurrent medical events (for example, cardiac angioplasty, and renal dialysis). If
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 24 of 49
transfer is essential, the ambulance service and receiving hospital must be advised in
advance of the infectious status of the patient.
6.4 Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Personal protective equipment (PPE) for the care of patients with COVID-19 is summarised in
Table 1, see Appendix 3 for how to put on and remove PPE.

6.4.1 Fluid resistant (Type IIR) surgical face masks (FRSM)
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 25 of 49
Fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical masks (FRSMs) are worn to protect the wearer from the
transmission of COVID-19 by respiratory droplets.
In all healthcare settings:
● A FRSM must be worn when working in close contact (within 1 metre) of a patient with
COVID-19 symptoms.
This provides a physical barrier to minimise contamination of the
mucosa of the mouth and nose.
● In an area where pandemic COVID-19 patients have been cohorted together, it may be
more practical for staff to wear a FRSM at all times, rather than only when in close
contact with a patient. Similarly, in primary care/outpatient settings it may be more
practical for staff working in a segregated (COVID-19 patient) area to wear a FRSM for
the duration they are in the patient area.
●
A FRSM for COVID-19 should:
– be well fitted covering both nose and mouth;
– not be allowed to dangle around the neck of the wearer after or between each
use;
– not be touched once put on;
– be changed when they become moist or damaged;
– be removed outside the patient room, cohort area or 1 metre away from the
patient with possible/confirmed COVID-19; and
– be worn once and then discarded as healthcare (clinical) waste (hand
hygiene must always be performed after disposal).
The provision of a FRSM for patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 at point of
assessment or triage in any healthcare setting should be considered if the patient can tolerate it
(except when in a dedicated COVID-19 area).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 26 of 49
6.4.2 Filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirators
Filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirators should be worn whenever there is a risk of
airborne transmission of pandemic COVID-19 i.e. during aerosol generating procedures (AGPs)
and at all times in intensive care unit (ICU), intensive therapy unit (ITU), high dependency unit
(HDU) where COVID-19 patients are cohorted.
All tight fitting respiratory protective equipment (RPE) (i.e. FFP3 respirators) must be:
● single use (disposable) and fluid-resistant*. Fluid resistant FFP3’s should be worn with
appropriate eye protection;
● fit tested on all healthcare staff who may be required to wear an FFP3 respirator to
ensure an adequate seal/fit according to the manufacturers’ guidance; fit checked
(according to the manufacturers’ guidance) every time an FFP3 respirator is donned to
ensure an adequate seal has been achieved;
● compatible with other facial protection used i.e. protective eyewear so that this does not
interfere with the seal of the respiratory protection. Regular corrective spectacles are not
considered adequate eye protection;
● disposed of and replaced if breathing becomes difficult, the respirator is damaged or
distorted, the respirator becomes obviously contaminated by respiratory secretions or
other body fluids, or if a proper face fit cannot be maintained; and
● be worn once and then discarded as healthcare (clinical) waste (hand hygiene
must always be performed after disposal).
*If wearing a FFP3 that is not fluid resistant, a full face shield/ visor must be worn
A FFP3 respirator, although ‘single use’, can be worn for as long as comfortable, for example
for the duration of a ward round or providing clinical care.
Once separated from the face FFP3s must be discarded.
In the absence of an anteroom/lobby remove FFP3 respirators in a safe area (e.g. outside the
isolation/cohort room/area).
All other PPE should be removed in the patient care area.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.

and Safety Executive website.

Page 28 of 49
6.5 Aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs)
Aerosols generated by medical procedures are one route for the transmission of the COVID-19
virus. The following procedures are considered to be potentially infectious AGPs:
● Intubation, extubation and related procedures;
● Tracheotomy/tracheostomy procedures;
● Manual ventilation;
● Open suctioning;
● Bronchoscopy;
● Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) e.g. Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) and
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ventilation (CPAP);
● Surgery and post-mortem procedures in which high-speed devices are used;
● High-frequency oscillating ventilation (HFOV);
● High-flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO)
● Induction of sputum (see glossary);
● Some dental procedures (e.g. high speed drilling).
For patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19, any of these potentially infectious AGPs
should only be carried out when essential. Where possible, these procedures should be carried
out in a single room with the doors shut. Only those healthcare staff who are needed to
undertake the procedure should be present. A disposable, fluid repellant surgical gown, gloves,
eye protection and a FFP3 respirator should be worn by those undertaking the procedure and
those in the room.
Certain other procedures/equipment may generate an aerosol from material other than patient
secretions but are not considered to represent a significant infectious risk. Procedures in this
category include:
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 29 of 49
● administration of pressurised humidified oxygen;
● administration of medication via nebulisation.
Note: During nebulisation, the aerosol derives from a non-patient source (the fluid in the
nebuliser chamber) and does not carry patient-derived viral particles. If a particle in the aerosol
coalesces with a contaminated mucous membrane, it will cease to be airborne and therefore
will not be part of an aerosol. Staff should use appropriate hand hygiene when helping patients
to remove nebulisers and oxygen masks.
6.6 Management of equipment and the care environment
Decontamination of equipment and the care environment must be performed using either:
● A combined detergent/disinfectant solution at a dilution of 1,000 parts per million
available chlorine (ppm available chlorine (av.cl.)); or
● A general purpose neutral detergent in a solution of warm water followed by a
disinfectant solution of 1,000ppm av.cl.
Only cleaning (detergent) and disinfectant products supplied by employers are to be used.
Products must be prepared and used according to the manufacturers’ instructions and
recommended product ""contact times"" must be followed. If alternative cleaning
agents/disinfectants are to be used, they should only on the advice of the IPCT and conform to
EN standard 14476 for virucidal activity
6.6.1 Equipment
Patient care equipment should be single-use items if possible. Reusable (communal) non-
invasive equipment should as far as possible be allocated to the individual patient or cohort of
patients.
Reusable (communal) non-invasive equipment must be decontaminated:
● between each patient and after patient use;
● after blood and body fluid contamination; and
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 30 of 49
● at regular intervals as part of equipment cleaning.
An increased frequency of decontamination should be considered for reusable non-invasive
care equipment when used in isolation/cohort areas.
• ventilators should be protected with a high efficiency filter, such as BS EN 13328-1
• closed system suction should be used
See Appendix 4 for guidance on routine decontamination of reusable non-invasive patient care
equipment.
Avoid the use of fans that re-circulate the air.10
There is no need to use disposable plates or cutlery. Crockery and cutlery can be washed by
hand or in a dishwasher using household detergent and hand-hot water after use.
6.6.2 Environment
Patient isolations rooms, cohort areas and clinical rooms must be decontaminated at least
daily. Clinical rooms should also be decontaminated after clinical sessions for patients with
suspected/known pandemic COVID-19. In addition, patient isolation rooms must be terminally
cleaned:
● Following resolution of symptoms, discharge or transfer (this includes removal and
laundering of all curtains and bed screens);
● Once vacated by staff following an AGP. Clearance of infectious particles after an AGP
is dependent on the mechanical/natural ventilation and air change per hour(ACH) within
the room. A single air change is estimated to remove 63% of airborne contaminants;
after 5 air changes, less than 1% of airborne contamination is thought to remain.
In an
isolation room with 10-12 ACH a minimum of 20 minutes is considered pragmatic; in a
side room with 6 ACH this would be approximately 1 hour. Advice should be sought from
the local Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT).
An increased frequency of decontamination should be incorporated into the environmental
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 31 of 49
decontamination schedules for areas where there may be higher environmental contamination
rates e.g.
● toilets/commodes particularly if patients have diarrhoea; and
● “frequently touched” surfaces such as medical equipment, door/toilet handles and locker
tops, patient call bells, over bed tables and bed rails should be cleaned at least twice
daily and when known to be contaminated with secretions, excretions or body fluids.
Domestic/cleaning staff performing environmental decontamination should:
● be allocated to specific area(s) and not be moved between COVID-19 and non-COVID-
19 care areas;
● be trained in which personal protective equipment (PPE) to use and the correct methods
of wearing, removing and disposing of PPE. The care environment should be kept clean
and clutter free. All non-essential items including toys, books and magazines should be
removed from reception and waiting areas, consulting and treatment rooms, emergency
departments, day rooms and lounges.
When made available, these items should not be
shared. All toys must be cleanable and should be cleaned regularly (preferably at the
same time as the environment).
6.7 Handling dead bodies
The principles of Standard Infection Control Precautions (SICPs) and Transmission Based
Precautions (TBPs) continue to apply whilst deceased individuals remain in the care
environment. This is due to the ongoing risk of infectious transmission via contact although the
risk is usually lower than for living patients. Where the deceased was known or suspected to
have been infected with COVID-19, there is no requirement for a body bag, and viewing,
hygienic preparations, post-mortem and embalming are all permitted.
Following a risk assessment of the potential post-mortem risk pathways PHE has developed
this advice in line with the principles set out in the HSE guidance for droplet transmission risk
as set out in: ‘Managing infection risks when handling the deceased: Guidance for the
mortuary, post-mortem room and funeral premises, and during exhumation’.

COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 32 of 49
7. Occupational health and staff
deployment
Prompt recognition of cases of COVID-19 among healthcare staff is essential to limit the
spread. Healthcare staff with influenza-like illness should not come to work. As a general
principle, healthcare staff who provide care in areas for suspected/confirmed patients should not
care for other patients, although exceptions may be necessary.
A risk assessment is required for health and social care staff at high risk of complications from
COVID-19, including pregnant staff. Employers should:
● Discuss with employees who are at risk or are pregnant the need to be deployed away from
areas used for the care of those who have, or are clinically suspected of having, COVID-19;
or, in the primary care setting, from clinics set up to manage people with COVID-19
symptoms.
● Ensure that advice is available to all healthcare staff, including specific advice to those at
risk from complications.
Bank, agency and locum staff should follow the same deployment advice as permanent staff.
As part of their employer’s duty of care, providers have a role to play in ensuring that a fit
testing programme is in place for those who may need to wear filtering face piece (class 3)
(FFP3) respirator. In the event of a breach in infection control procedures e.g. an incorrectly worn
FFP3 respirator during a potentially infectious aerosol generating procedure (AGP, staff should
be reviewed by occupational health.
Occupational health departments should lead on the implementation of systems to monitor staff
illness and absence.
Where possible, staff who have had confirmed COVID-19 (early in the stages of the outbreak
this would be via virology confirmation, thereafter, this is likely to be as per case definition)
should work in the cohort areas and care for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients. Such
staff should continue to follow the infection control precautions, including personal protective
equipment (PPE), as outlined in this document.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 33 of 49
8. Specific settings
The following guidance is given to assist specific care settings to implement the principles of
standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission based precautions (TBPs)
described in this document, which apply in all care settings.
8.1 Care home settings
Isolation within a care home for a known/suspected infection can be achieved in the persons’
bedroom in most cases. Residents should remain in their bedroom whilst considered infectious
(as described above) and the door should remain closed (if unable to isolate the individual then
this should be documented).
8.2 Primary care
In primary care settings (e.g. General Practitioner (GP) practices) suspected COVID-19
patients should be segregated in place or time from other patients, this may be achieved by:
● Creating a separate area within the facility for care of suspected patients, including
separate waiting and reception areas if possible. The area should be separated from
non-segregated areas by closed doors. To control entry, signage should be displayed
warning of the segregated area.
● Alternatively, suspected patients should be seen at a different time from other patients,
with disinfection of shared areas taking place between different clinics.
● GP practices may make arrangements for distinct COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 clinics.
(Non-essential GP clinics may need to be cancelled to enable this).
● Primary care staff should, wherever possible be allocated to either COVID-19
or
other patients.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 34 of 49
8.3 Outpatient settings
For patients who develop symptoms and have long term health conditions that require
attendance at outpatient settings e.g. hospital day care, options include:
● deferring the procedure and re-scheduling the next appointment;
● transferring the patient to a designated hospital with isolation or cohort facilities;
● introducing physical barriers such as screens in special units to separate patients with
symptoms of COVID-19.
8.4 Dental surgeries
Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 should not be seen for routine dental care. If a dental
emergency is suspected such as severe haemorrhaging or difficulty in breathing the patient
should be seen in a hospital environment.
If emergency dental care is required staff in attendance should be kept to a minimum and must
wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (see table 1) particularly if this involves
high speed drilling section 6.5.
8.5 Home visits
Home visits should continue as long as required to patients without COVID-19. If it becomes
necessary to suspend some home visits, alternative arrangements must be put in place to
maintain contact (e.g. telephone liaison). Health and social care staff performing non-deferrable
essential visits (for example, child protection) to households with suspected/confirmed COVID-
19, should follow the infection control precautions in this document.
8.6 Ambulances
In ambulances, patient segregation can be achieved by:
● designating an ambulance(s) for transfer of patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19
for the duration of each shift;
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 35 of 49
● transporting coughing and sneezing patients on their own whenever possible. However, if
pressure upon the service occurs, two patients with symptoms of COVID-19 may be
transferred together and should wear a fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask (FRSM).
Depending on the stage of the pandemic and an assessment of risk, ambulance staff may be
required to wear respiratory protective equipment (RPE). This will be determined locally.
8.7 Emergency departments and acute assessment units
Emergency departments and acute assessment units may be overwhelmed with patients
seeking care during the peak of a pandemic. Alternative approaches to triage and initial
assessment will be required to:
● rapidly screen and identify those who have symptoms of COVID-19 upon their arrival;
● separate symptomatic patients from others to reduce the risk of transmission; and
● determine as early as possible the type of care patients will require (i.e. see and
discharge or admit for treatment).
8.7.1 Screening and triage
Signage should be displayed prior to and on entry to assessment units instructing patients with
symptoms to inform reception staff immediately on their arrival.
A triage practitioner(s) should be based in the reception to manage patient flow, including
deferral of patients who do not require emergency care.
8.7.2 Reception area
Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 should be triaged to a segregated waiting and
assessment area immediately. Patients should be instructed to stay in this waiting area and not
visit other departments or, parts of the hospital/unit, or go to public areas such as the cafeteria.
Signage and physical barriers should be used as appropriate.
If separate areas for patients with symptoms of COVID-19 cannot be established, an alternative
area/site should be set up for those at highest risk of complications from COVID-19 and who do
not have respiratory symptoms (e.g. patients presenting for dialysis, patients with a history of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 36 of 49
blood cell or organ transplantation, chemotherapy, or who are immunocompromised for other
reasons).
Patients who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 but require prompt acute care assessment
should be triaged to a specific waiting and examination area, physically separate from the
COVID-19 waiting and assessment area.
8.7.3Critical care
PPE must be worn:
• all respiratory equipment must be protected with a high efficiency filter (such as BS EN 13328-
1). This filter must be disposed of after use
• disposable respiratory equipment should be used wherever possible. Re-usable equipment
must, as a minimum, be decontaminated in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
• a closed suctioning system must be used
• ventilator circuits should not be broken unless necessary
• ventilators must be placed on standby when carrying out bagging
8.7.4 Theatres
• theatres must be informed in advance of a patient transfer of a confirmed or possible COVID-
19 positive case
• the patient should be transported directly to the operating theatre and should wear a surgical
mask if it can be tolerated
• the patient should be anaesthetised and recovered in the theatre. Staff should wear protective
clothing but only those at risk of exposure from aerosol generating procedures, i.e during
intubation need to wear FFP3 respirators and full gowns. considerations about the use of
respiratory/anaesthetic equipment are addressed in the critical care section above
• instruments and devices should be decontaminated in the normal manner in accordance with
manufacturers’ advice
• both laryngoscope handle and blade should either be single use or reprocessed in the Sterile
Supply Department. Video laryngoscope blades should be single use and scope/handle
decontaminated as per manufacture instructions.
• the theatre should be cleaned as per local policy for infected cases, paying particular attention
to hand contact points on the anaesthetic machine
• theatres should not be used by staff or patients for 20 minutes after the patient leaves if
conventionally ventilated, or 5 minutes if ultraclean ventilation is used
• possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19 should be placed at the end of the list where feasible

Appendix 7 Glossary
Aerosol-generating procedures
(AGPs)
Certain medical and patient care activities that
can result in the release of airborne particles
(aerosols). AGPs can create a risk of airborne
transmission of infections that are usually only
spread by droplet transmission.
Airborne Transmission
The spread of infection from one person to
another by airborne particles (aerosols)
containing infectious agents.
Airborne particles
Very small particles that may contain
infectious agents. They can remain in the air for
long periods of time and can be carried over
long distances by air currents. Airborne particles
can be released when a person coughs
or sneezes, and during aerosol generating
procedures (AGPs). “Droplet nuclei” are
aerosols formed from the evaporation of larger
droplet particles (see Droplet Transmission).
Aerosols formed from droplet particles in this
way behave as other aerosols.
Airborne precautions Measures used to prevent and control infections
spread without necessarily having close patient
contact via aerosols (less than or equal to 5μm)
from the respiratory tract of one individual
directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae
of another individual. Aerosols can penetrate the
respiratory system to the alveolar level.
BS/EN standards
Mandatory technical specifications created by
either the British Standards Institute (BS) or
European Standardisation Organisations (EN) in
collaboration with government bodies, industry
experts and trade associations. They aim to
ensure the quality and safety of products,
services and systems.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 44 of 49
Cohort area
An area (room, bay, ward) in which two or more
patients (a cohort) with the same confirmed
infection are placed. A cohort area should be
physically separate from other patients.
Contact precautions
Measures used to prevent and control infections
that spread via direct contact with the patient or
indirectly from the patient’s immediate care
environment (including care equipment). This is
the most common route of infection
transmission.
Contact transmission Contact transmission is the most common route
of transmission, and consists of two distinct
types: direct contact and indirect contact. Direct
transmission occurs when microorganisms are
transmitted directly from an infectious individual
to another individual without the involvement of
another contaminated person or object (fomite).
Indirect transmission occurs when
microorganisms are transmitted from an
infectious individual to another individual through
a contaminated object or person (fomite) or
person.
COVID-19 COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory
disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The
disease was discovered in China in December
2019 and has since spread around the world.
Droplet precautions
Measures used to prevent and control infections
spread over short distances (at least 1 metre (3
feet) via droplets (greater than 5μm) from the
respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a
mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another
individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory
system to above the alveolar level.
Droplet transmission
The spread of infection from one person to
another by droplets containing infectious agents.
Eye/Face protection
Worn when there is a risk from splashing of
secretion (including respiratory secretions),
eye/face protection can be achieved by the use
of any one of the following: a surgical mask with
integrated visor; a full face visor/shield; or
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 45 of 49
polycarbonate safety spectacles or equivalent;
FFP3 Respiratory protection that is worn over the nose
and mouth designed to protect the wearer from
inhaling hazardous substances, including
airborne particles (aerosols). FFP stands for
filtering face piece. There are three categories of
FFP respirator: FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3. An FFP3
respirator provides the highest level of
protection, and is the only category of respirator
legislated for use in UK healthcare settings.
Fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical face
mask (FRSM)
A disposable fluid-resistant mask worn over the
nose and mouth to protect the mucous
membranes of the wearer’s nose and mouth
from splashes and infectious droplets. FRSMs
can also be used to protect patients.
When
recommended for infection control purposes a
'surgical face mask' typically denotes a
fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask.
Fluid-resistant
A term applied to fabrics that resist liquid
penetration, often used interchangeably with
'fluid-repellent' when describing the properties of
protective clothing or equipment.
Frequently touched surfaces
Surfaces of the environment which are
commonly touched/come into contact with
human hands.
High Consequence Infectious Disease
(HCID)
In the UK, a high consequence infectious disease
(HCID) is defined according to the following
criteria: Acute infectious disease; typically has a
high case-fatality rate; may not have effective
prophylaxis or treatment; often difficult to
recognise and detect rapidly; ability to spread in
the community and within healthcare settings; and
requires an enhanced individual, population and
system response to ensure it is managed
effectively, efficiently and safely.
Healthcare/clinical waste Waste produced as a result of healthcare
activities for example soiled dressings, sharps.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 46 of 49
High risk units
Intensive care units, intensive therapy units and
high dependency units.
Incubation period
The period between the infection of an individual
by a pathogen and the manifestation of the illness
or disease it causes.
Induction of sputum Induction of sputum typically involves the
administration of nebulised saline to moisten and
loosen respiratory secretions (this may be
accompanied by chest physiotherapy (percussion
and vibration)) to induce forceful coughing.
Infectious linen
Linen that has been used by a patient who is
known or suspected to be infectious and/or linen
that is contaminated with blood and/or other body
fluids e.g. faeces.
Long term health condition
Defined as:
• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
bronchitis, emphysema or asthma
• Heart disease
• Kidney disease
• Liver disease
• Stroke or a transient ischaemic attack (TIA)
• Diabetes
• Lowered immunity as a result of disease or
medical treatment, such as steroid
medication or cancer treatment
• Neurological condition, such as
Parkinson's disease, motor neurone
disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), cerebral
palsy, or a learning disability
• Problem with spleen, including sickle cell
disease, or had spleen removed
• A BMI of 40 or above (obese).
Negative pressure isolation room
A room which maintains permanent negative
pressure i.e. air flow is from the outside adjacent
space (e.g. corridor) into the room and then
exhausted to the outdoors.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.

New and emerging viruses (including
respiratory viruses)
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) defines emerging infectious diseases as:
• New infections resulting from changes in or
evolution of existing organisms.
• Known infections spreading to new
geographical areas or populations.
• Previously unrecognised infections
appearing in areas undergoing ecological
transformation.
• Old infections re-emerging as a result of
antibiotic resistance in known agents or
breakdown in public health measures.
Personal Protective Equipment
(PPE)
Equipment a person wears to protect themselves
from risks to their health or safety, including
exposure to infection agents. The level of PPE
required depends on: Suspected/known infectious
agent; severity of the illness caused; transmission
route of the infectious agent; and the
procedure/task being undertaken.
Respiratory droplets
A small droplet, such as a particle of moisture
released from the mouth during coughing,
sneezing, or speaking.
Respiratory symptoms ‘Respiratory symptoms’ include rhinorrhoea
(runny nose); sore throat; cough; difficulty
breathing or shortness of breath.
Segregation
Physically separating or isolating from other
people.
SARS-CoV Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,
the virus responsible for the 2003 outbreak of
human coronavirus disease.
SARS-CoV-2 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,
the virus responsible for the 2019 outbreak of
COVID-19 disease.
Standard infection control
precautions (SICPs)
SICPs are the basic infection prevention and
control measures necessary to reduce the risk of
transmission of an infectious agent from both
recognised and unrecognised sources of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.

infection.
Single room
A room with space for one patient and usually
contains as a minimum: a bed; locker/wardrobe;
and a clinical wash-hand basin.
Staff cohorting
When staff care for one specific group of patients
and do not move between different patient
cohorts. Patient cohorts may include for example
‘symptomatic’, ‘asymptomatic and exposed’, or
‘asymptomatic and unexposed’ patient groups.
Transmission based precautions
Additional precautions to be used in addition to
SICPs when caring for patients with a known or
suspected infection or colonisation.

Dear Colleague,
IMPORTANT AND URGENT – NEXT STEPS ON NHS RESPONSE TO COVID-19
Thank you for your extensive work to date to prepare for this rapidly increasing
pandemic, following the NHS declaration of a Level 4 National Incident on 30
January.
Last night the Government announced additional measures to seek to reduce the
spread across the country. It is essential these measures succeed. However as the
outbreak intensifies over the coming days and weeks, the evidence from other
countries and the advice from SAGE and the Chief Medical Officer is that at the peak
of the outbreak the NHS will still come under intense pressure.
This letter therefore sets out important actions we are now asking every part of the
NHS to put in place to redirect staff and resources, building on multiple actions
already in train. These will:
• Free-up the maximum possible inpatient and critical care capacity.
• Prepare for, and respond to, the anticipated large numbers of COVID-19
patients who will need respiratory support.
• Support staff, and maximise their availability.

• Play our part in the wider population measures newly announced by
Government.
• Stress-test operational readiness.
• Remove routine burdens, so as to facilitate the above.
Please therefore now enact the following measures:
1. Free-up the maximum possible inpatient and critical care capacity
The operational aim is to expand critical care capacity to the maximum; free up
30,000 (or more) of the English NHS’s 100,000 general and acute beds from the
actions identified in a) and b) below; and supplement them with all available
additional capacity as per c) below. To that end, trusts are asked now to:
a) Assume that you will need to postpone all non-urgent elective operations from
15th April at the latest, for a period of at least three months. However you also
have full local discretion to wind down elective activity over the next 30 days
as you see best, so as to free up staff for refresher training, beds for COVID
patients, and theatres/recovery facilities for adaptation work. Emergency
admissions, cancer treatment and other clinically urgent care should continue
unaffected. In the interim, providers should continue to use all available
capacity for elective operations including the independent sector, before
COVID constraints curtail such work. This could free up 12,000-15,000
hospital beds across England.
b) Urgently discharge all hospital inpatients who are medically fit to leave.
Community health providers must take immediate full responsibility for urgent
discharge of all eligible patients identified by acute providers on a discharge
list. For those needing social care, emergency legislation before Parliament
this week will ensure that eligibility assessments do not delay discharge. New
government funding for these discharge packages and to support the supply
and resilience of out-of-hospital care more broadly is being made available.
(See section 6f of this letter). Trusts and CCGs will need to work with local
authority partners to ensure that additional capacity is appropriately
commissioned. This could potentially free up to 15,000 acute beds currently
occupied by patients awaiting discharge or with lengths of stay over 21 days.
c) Nationally we are now in the process of block-buying capacity in independent
hospitals. This should be completed within a fortnight. Their staff and facilities
will then be flexibly available to you for urgent surgery, as well as for
repurposing their beds, operating theatres and recovery facilities to provide
respiratory support for COVID-19 patients. As soon as we have the detailed
capacity map of what will be available in each part of the country we will share
that with you via Regional Directors. NHS trusts and foundation trusts should
3
free up their own private pay beds where they exist. In addition, community
health providers and social care providers are asked to free up community
hospital and intermediate care beds that could be used flexibly within the next
fortnight. These measures together could free up to 10,000 beds.
2. Prepare for, and respond to, large numbers of inpatients requiring
respiratory support
Emerging international and UK data on COVID-19 patients suggests that a
significant proportion who are hospitalised require respiratory support, particularly
mechanical ventilation and to a lesser extent non-invasive ventilation.
a) Work is well in hand nationally to secure a step change in oxygen supply and
distribution to hospitals. Locally, hospital estates teams have now reported on
their internal oxygen piping, pumping and bedside availability. All trusts able
to enhance these capabilities across their estate are asked to do so
immediately, and you will be fully reimbursed accordingly. The goal is to have
as many beds, critical care bays, theatre and recovery areas able to
administer oxygen as possible.
b) National procurement for assisted respiratory support capacity, particularly
mechanical ventilation, is also well under way in conjunction with the
Department of Health and Social Care. In addition, the Government is working
with the manufacturing sector to bring new manufacturers online. These
devices will be made available to the NHS across England, Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland according to need. Mark Brandreth, chief executive of
Agnes Jones and Robert Hunt foundation trust is now supporting this work.
c) In respect of PPE, the DHSC procurement team reports that nationally there
is currently adequate national supply in line with PHE recommended usage,
and the pandemic influenza stockpile has now been released to us. However
locally distribution issues are being reported. Michael Wilson, chief executive
of SASH, is now helping resolve this on behalf of the NHS. In addition if you
experience problems there is now a dedicated line for you: 0800 915 9964 /
0191 283 6543 / Email: supplydisruptionservice@nhsbsa.nhs.uk.
d) A far wider range of staff than usual will be involved in directly supporting
patients with respiratory needs. Refresher training for all clinical and patient-
facing staff must therefore be provided within the next fortnight. A cross-
specialty clinical group supported by the Royal Colleges is producing
guidance to ensure learning from experience here and abroad is rapidly
shared across the UK. This will include: a short education package for the
entire NHS workforce; a service guide, including for anaesthetics and critical
care; COVID-19 clinical management guides in collaboration with NICE.
mailto:supplydisruptionservice@nhsbsa.nhs.uk

e) Segregate all patients with respiratory problems (including presumed COVID-
19 patients). Segregation should initially be between those with respiratory
illness and other cases. Then once test results are known, positive cases
should be cohort-nursed in bays or wards.
f) Mental Health, Learning Disability and Autism providers must plan for COVID-
19 patients at all inpatient settings. You need to identify areas where COVID-
19 patients requiring urgent admission could be most effectively isolated and
cared for (for example single rooms, ensuite, or mental health wards on acute
sites). Case by case reviews will be required where any patient is unable to
follow advice on containment and isolation. Staff should undergo refresher
training on physical health care, vital signs and the deteriorating patient, so
they are clear about triggers for transfer to acute inpatient care if indicated.
3. Support our staff, and maximise staff availability
a) The NHS will support staff to stay well and at work. Please ensure you have
enhanced health and wellbeing support for our frontline staff at what is going
to be a very difficult time.
b) As extra coronavirus testing capability comes on line we are also asking
Public Health England as a matter of urgency to establish NHS targeted staff
testing for symptomatic staff who would otherwise need to self-isolate for 7
days. For those staff affected by PHE’s 14 day household isolation policy,
staff should - on an entirely voluntary basis - be offered the alternative option
of staying in NHS-reimbursed hotel accommodation while they continue to
work. Sarah-Jane Marsh, chief executive of Birmingham Women’s and
Children’s foundation trust is now supporting this work.
c) For staff members at increased risk according to PHE’s guidance (including
pregnant women), if necessary, NHS organisations should make adjustments
to enable staff to stay well and at work wherever possible. Adjustments may
include working remotely or moving to a lower risk area. Further guidance will
be made available and the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology will
provide further guidance about pregnant women.
d) For otherwise healthy staff who are at higher risk of severe illness from
COVID-19 required by PHE’s guidance to work from home, please consider
how they can support the provision of telephone-based or digital / video-
based consultations and advice for outpatients, 111, and primary care. For
non-clinical staff, please consider how they can continue to contribute
remotely. Further guidance will be made available
5
e) The GMC, NMC and other professional regulators are also writing to clinicians
who have relinquished their licence to practice within the past three years to
see whether they would be willing to return to help in some capacity.
f) Urgent work is also underway led by chief nursing officer Ruth May, NHS
chief people officer Prerana Issar and Health Education England, the relevant
regulators and universities to deploy medical and nursing students, and
clinical academics. They are finalising this scheme in the next week.
g) All appropriate registered Nurses, Midwives and AHP’s currently in non-
patient facing roles will be asked to support direct clinical practice in the NHS
in the next few weeks, following appropriate local induction and support.
Clinically qualified staff at NHSE/I are now being redeployed to frontline
clinical practice.
h) The four UK chief medical officers, the national medical director, the Academy
of Medical Royal Colleges and the GMC have written to all UK doctors
stressing that it will be appropriate and necessary for clinicians to work
beyond their usual disciplinary boundaries and specialisms under these
difficult circumstances, and they will support individuals who do so. (see
https://www.aomrc.org.uk/wp-
content/uploads/2020/03/0320_letter_supporting_doctors_in_COVID-19.pdf )
Equivalent considerations apply for nurses, AHPs and other registered health
professionals.
4. Support the wider population measures newly announced by Government
Measures announced last night are detailed at:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-
and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-
protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults
a) Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) and local
authorities in conjunction with their Local Resilience Forums (LRFs) have lead
responsibility for overseeing support for older and vulnerable people who are
going to be ‘shielded’ at home over the coming months. Community health
services and voluntary organisations should engage with LRFs on how best to
do this.
b) A number of these individuals would be expected to have routine or urgent
GP, diagnostic or outpatient appointments over the coming months. Providers
should roll out remote consultations using video, telephone, email and text
message services for this group as a priority and extend to cover all important
routine activity as soon as possible, amongst others. David Probert, chief

executive of Moorfields foundation trust, is now leading a taskforce to support
acute providers rapidly stand up these capabilities, with NHSX leading on
primary care. Face-to-face appointments should only take place when
absolutely necessary.
c) For patients in the highest risk groups, the NHS will be identifying and
contacting them over the coming week. They are likely to need enhanced
support from their general practices, with whom they are by definition already
in regular contact. GP services should agree locally which sites should
manage essential face-to-face assessments. Further advice on this is being
developed jointly with PHE and will be available this week.
d) As part of the overall ‘social distancing’ strategy to protect staff and patients,
the public should be asked to greatly limit visitors to patients, and to consider
other ways of keeping in touch such as phone calls.
5. Stress-test your operational readiness
a) All providers should check their business continuity plans and review the
latest guidance and standard operating procedures (SOP), which can be
found at www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/.
b) Trust Incident Management Teams – which must now be in place in all
organisations - should receive and cascade guidance and information,
including CAS Alerts. It is critical that we have accurate response to data
requests and daily sitrep data to track the spread of the virus and our
collective response, so please ensure you have sufficient administrative
capacity allocated to support these tasks.
c) For urgent patient safety communications, primary care providers will be
contacted through the Central Alerting System (CAS). Please register to
receive CAS alerts directly from the MHRA:
https://www.cas.mhra.gov.uk/Register.aspx.
d) This week we are undertaking a system-wide stress-testing exercise which
you are asked to participate in. It takes the form of a series of short sessions
spread over four days from today. Each day will represent a consecutive week
in the response to the outbreak, starting at ‘week six’ into the modelled
epidemic. We would strongly encourage all Hospital Incident Management
Teams with wider system engagement (including with primary care and local
government representation) to take part.

6. Remove routine burdens
To free you up to devote maximum operational effort to COVID readiness and
response, we are now taking the following steps nationally:
a) Cancelling all routine CQC inspections, effective immediately.
b) Working with Government to ensure that the emergency legislation being
introduced in Parliament this week provides us with wide staffing and
regulatory flexibility as it pertains to the health and social care sector.
c) Reviewing and where appropriate temporarily suspending certain
requirements on GP practices and community pharmacists. Income will be
protected if other routine contracted work has to be substituted. We will issue
guidance on this, which will also cover other parts of the NHS.
d) Deferring publication of the NHS People Plan and the Clinical Review of
Standards recommendations to later this year. Deferring publication of the
NHS Long Term Plan Implementation Framework to the Autumn, and
recommending you do the same for your local plans.
e) Moving to block contract payments ‘on account’ for all NHS trusts and
foundation trusts for an initial period of 1 April to 31 July 2020, with
suspension of the usual PBR national tariff payment architecture and
associated administrative/ transactional processes.
f) Additional funding to cover your extra costs of responding to the coronavirus
emergency. Specific financial guidance on how to estimate, report against,
and be reimbursed for these costs is being issued this week. The Chancellor
of the Exchequer committed in Parliament last week that “Whatever extra
resources our NHS needs to cope with coronavirus – it will get.” So financial
constraints must not and will not stand in the way of taking immediate and
necessary action - whether in terms of staffing, facilities adaptation,
equipment, patient discharge packages, staff training, elective care, or any
other relevant category.
COVID-19 presents the NHS with arguably the greatest challenge it has faced since
its creation. Our health service - through our skilled and dedicated staff - is renowned
for the professional, flexible and resilient way that it responds to adversity. Please
accept our sincere thanks for your leadership, and that of your staff, in what is going
to be a highly challenging period.
This is a time when the entire NHS will benefit from pulling together in a nationally
coordinated effort. But this is going to be a fast-moving situation requiring agile
8
responses. If there are things you spot that you think we all should be doing
differently, please let us know personally. And within the national framework, do also
use your discretion to do the right thing in your particular circumstances. You will
have our backing in doing so.
With best wishes,
Sir Simon Stevens
Amanda Pritchard

ANNEX: CORONAVIRUS COST REIMBURSEMENT
This guidance sets out the amended financial arrangements for the NHS for the period
between 1 April and 31 July. These changes will enable the NHS and partner
organisations (including Local Authorities and the Independent Sector) to respond to
COVID-19. We will continue to revise this guidance to reflect operational changes and
feedback from the service as the response develops.
We will shortly be making a payment on account to all acute and ambulance providers
to cover the costs of COVID-19-related work done so far this year, with final costs for
the current financial year being confirmed as part of the year end processes. This initial
payment will be based on information already submitted by providers. Future
payments will be based on further cost submissions.
All NHS providers and commissioners must carefully record the costs incurred in
responding to the outbreak and will be required to report actual costs incurred on a
monthly basis. Accurate record keeping during this time is crucial - record keeping
must meet the requirements of external audit, and public and Parliamentary scrutiny.
To support reimbursement and track expenditure we will in due course be asking all
relevant organisations to provide best estimates of expected costs from now until the
expected end of the peak outbreak. We will provide further guidance with relevant
assumptions in order to support you in making these estimates.
REVENUE COSTS
Contractual payments and provider reimbursement
We are suspending the operational planning process for 2020/21.
We will provide all NHS providers a guaranteed minimum level of income reflecting
the current cost base on the following basis:
a) Commissioners should agree block contracts with the NHS providers with
whom they have a contract (NHS Trusts, Foundation Trusts, Mental Health,
Community and Ambulance trusts) to cover the period 1 April to 31 July. This
should provide a guaranteed monthly payment. For CCGs the value of this
payment will be calculated nationally for each CCG/provider relationship. This
figure will be based on the average monthly expenditure implied by the
provider figures in the M9 Agreement of Balances return plus an uplift that
allows for the impact of inflation (including pay uplifts and CNST) but
excluding the tariff efficiency factor. It will not include activity growth. For
mental health trusts the uplift will include an additional sum consistent with
10
delivering the Mental Health Investment Standard. The monthly payment
should include CQUIN and assume 100% delivery.
b) Trusts should suspend invoicing for non-contracted activity for the period 1
April to 31 July. A sum equivalent to the historical monthly average will be
added to the block contract of the provider’s coordinating commissioner.
Providers should continue to record all activity including NCAs in SUS in the
normal way.
c) A national top-up payment will be provided to providers to reflect the difference
between the actual costs and income guaranteed by steps 1 and 2 where the
expected cost base (which will be calculated as the average monthly
expenditure over the period November to January uplifted for inflation) is higher.
The Financial Recovery Fund and associated rules will be suspended during
this period. The top-up payment will take into account individual provider CNST
contributions compared to that funded in the allowance for cost inflation.
We will provide these numbers to Commissioners and Providers on Monday 23 March.
Providers should claim for additional costs where the block payments do not equal
actual costs to reflect genuine and reasonable additional marginal costs due to
COVID-19. These reasonable costs should include:
a) Evidenced increases in staffing costs compared to the baseline period
associated with dealing with increased total activity.
b) Increases in temporary staffing to cover increased levels of sickness absence
or to deal with other caring responsibilities (e.g. to look after other family
members).
c) Payments for bank or sub-contractor staff to ensure all sickness absence is
covered consistent with Government’s announced policy and public health
advice which aren’t otherwise covered under normal practice; and
d) Additional costs of dealing with COVID-19 activity. For example: the costs of
running NHS111 assessment pods; increases in the volumes required or prices
of equipment to deal with the response to the virus which aren’t offset by
reductions elsewhere; extra costs of decontamination and transport for the
ambulance service; higher testing volumes in acute-based laboratories; and
community-based swabbing services.
Claims should be made on a monthly basis, alongside regular monthly financial
reports. This should provide sufficient funds for providers to deliver a break-even
11
position through the period and will provide the basis against which we will monitor
financial performance.
We will monitor the impact of any changes in income levels from non-NHS services,
in particular from local authorities. Providers should escalate to regional teams as
appropriate.
The payments made by commissioners under block contract arrangements should not
be revised to reflect any short falls in normal contractual performance during this
period. The majority of NHS acute providers are already exempt from the majority of
contract sanctions; for the duration of the outbreak until further notice any remaining
contract sanctions for all NHS provider groups are to be suspended.
It is important that providers and commissioners pay promptly during this time, so that
cash flow for NHS and non-NHS suppliers of goods and services does not become a
barrier to service provision.
The arrangements described above should mean there is minimal requirement for
interim working capital support during this period. Providers that believe they require
supplementary working capital support should follow the normal procedure to access
such support.
Funding for commissioners
Commissioner allocations for 2020/21 have already been notified as part of
operational planning and will not be changed. However, in assessing individual
commissioner financial positions and affordability we will take into account:
a) The impact of the block contracting approach set out above including both the
cost of removing the tariff efficiency factor and the benefit of excluding activity
growth from the calculation.
b) Expected reductions in investments for service developments
• the temporary arrangements for non-contracted activity, transferring
funding to make sure that lead commissioners have adequate funds to
pay providers; and
• the costs of additional service commitments as described below for
example for out of hours provision, additional NHS111 investment,
purchase of step-down beds and provision of rapid discharge/ additional
social care capacity.
c) We will also be reviewing planned transformation initiatives, and where we
consider that these will not be able to proceed during the coronavirus
emergency we will reflect this in the distribution of transformation funding.
12
d) In addition, a number of NHS commissioners are dependent on additional
central support to fully cover their expenditure. NHSE/I will calculate a central
top up payment on broadly the same basis as FRF to cover the difference
between allocations as set out above and expected costs.
Financial Governance
The maintenance of financial control and stewardship of public funds will remain
critical during the NHS response to COVID-19. Chief Executives, Accountable Officers
and Boards must continue to comply with their legal responsibilities and have regard
to their duties as set out in Managing Public Money and other related guidance. Any
financial mismanagement during this period will be dealt with in exactly the same way
as at any other time.
We recommend that NHS organisations undertake an urgent review of financial
governance to ensure decisions to commit resources in response to COVID-19 are
robust. Naturally, all organisations should test the resilience of their finance functions
and business continuity plans to make sure that the most important elements (running
payroll, paying suppliers, core reporting) can continue even with significant staff
absences. We are also asking you to consider the resilience of your fraud prevention
arrangements.
As normal financial arrangements have been suspended, no new revenue business
investments should be entered into unless related to Covid-19 or unless approved by
NHSE/I as consistent with a previously agreed plan. Where costs have already been
committed or contractual commitments entered into, providers should agree an
approach with NHSE/I as above.
Normal consultancy approval and agency reporting requirements must be maintained
during this period.
SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL FUNDING CONSIDERATIONS
Purchase of enhanced discharge support services
CCGs will be asked to work with their local authority partners to commission additional
out-of-hospital care and support capacity, in particular to facilitate step down of
patients from secondary care and so free up acute beds. These are expected to be a
blend of care home beds, hospices, and home-care support.
Detailed operational guidance for the procurement and management of these beds
will be issued separately including more detailed finance guidance. To make sure that
funding decisions do not restrict the pace of discharges, additional resources will be
provided to pay for the community bed or a package of care post-discharge for any
13
patient that needs it. New guidance will also ensure that eligibility assessments do not
delay new care packages being put in place. We will continue to review this approach
and will ask CCGs and local authorities to move to standard commissioning and
funding routes once the impact of Covid-19 sufficiently diminishes – you should plan
therefore on the basis of an average length of care package.
Additional funding will be provided based on monthly cost returns from CCGs.
Specialised services
As described above, Specialised Services contracts will follow the same principles as
CCG commissioned activity, and block values will be based on the average 2019/20
expenditure up to month 9, with an uplift to recognise the impact of pay uplifts and
other cost increases.
Arrangements for pass through Drugs and Devices costs will continue to operate as
currently on a cost and volume basis, to ensure that providers do not face any financial
consequences of any increases in activity or cost.
Specialised providers will be required to respond to the most serious cases of COVID-
19 through the provision of High Consequence Infectious Disease units,
Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation services and other specialised care functions.
Any specific investments and costs incurred by these units are being coordinated
through the National Highly Specialised team.
NHS 111
NHS 111 has been commissioned nationally to provide a dedicated Covid-19
response service. This service will continue to be contracted for and funded nationally.
In addition, having reviewed the pressures on the wider NHS 111 service additional
funding will be released from NHSE/I via lead commissioners, who will then make
necessary arrangements for payment to NHS 111 providers.
General Practice
The key principle is that from 1 April we free up practices to prioritise workload
according to what is necessary to prepare for and manage the outbreak, and therefore
guarantee that income will be protected if other routine contracted work has to be
substituted. This does not prevent us from continuing to measure activities (for
example those undertaken with QOF) but it ceases to put 2020/21 income at risk for
performance.
We will make sure that funding does not influence clinical decision making by ensuring
that all GP practices in 2020/21 continue to be paid at rates that assume they would
14
have continued to perform at the same levels from the beginning of the outbreak as
they had done previously, including for the purposes of QoF, DES and LES payments.
CCGs should plan to make payments on this basis. NHSE/I will reimburse any
additional costs as part of our wider finance agreement on Covid-19.
Out of Hours Provision
CCGs have been asked to procure additional GP out of hours provision in order to
provide home-based care for any patients that have tested positive for coronavirus in
the community. CCGs will be reimbursed for the additional costs incurred in delivering
this service through the allocations process. CCGs will be required to submit a monthly
return of additional cost incurred which will provide the basis of additional payments.
To keep the administrative burden to a minimum, where a CCG has contracted for this
service on behalf of itself and others, reimbursement will be directed through the lead
CCG.
Community Pharmacy
Where required, CCGs will be reimbursed for the following:
a) An NHS Urgent Medicines Supply Service for patients whose General Practice
is closed.
b) A Medicines Delivery Service to support Covid-19 positive and vulnerable
patients self-isolating at home.
c) Payments to contractors who are required to close due to Covid-19 related
reasons.
Optometry and dental
For the time being we expect that funding for dentistry and optometry will continue in
line with existing contractual arrangements using assumptions rolled over from
2019/20 where required. We will keep this under review and address any issues as
they arise.
Third and Independent Sector Providers
Details of reimbursement for any additional services to be procured from the third
sector or from independent sector organisations will be issued in due course.
15
CAPITAL COSTS
NHSE/I will shortly issue indicative capital allocations for 2020/21. Additional capital
expenditure will be required to support our response to the virus in a number of areas,
including purchase of pods, capital modifications to existing estate, purchasing of
ventilators and other medical equipment, and IT assets to enable smarter working
including remote consultations. In a number of cases NHSE/I may bulk-purchase
assets to secure the necessary resource as quickly as possible. However, this will not
always be practical or desirable, so below are the arrangements for providers and
commissioners to access capital in relation to the COVID-19 response. The key criteria
against which we will assess claims are:
a) The proposed expenditure must be clearly linked to delivery of our COVID-19
response;
NHS
b) In the case of asset purchases, the asset must be capable of being delivered
within the expected duration of the outbreak; and
c) In the case of modifications to estate, the works must be capable of being
completed within the expected duration of the outbreak.
Commissioner capital
We anticipate that individual claims for capital expenditure by commissioners will fall
within the delegated budgetary limits for NHSE/I of £10m. Any requests for capital
expenditure by commissioners including any assets being purchased on behalf of
general practice should be relayed to NHSE/I regional teams for assessment with the
national team, following which the required capital allocation will be issued.
Provider capital
We anticipate that individual claims for capital expenditure by providers will fall within
the delegated budgetary limits for trusts of £15m. Any requests for capital expenditure
by providers should be relayed to NHSE/I regional team for rapid assessment with the
national team to enable swift decision making and disbursement of cash where
appropriate. PDC charges will not be levied on any funding supplied in connection with
COVID-19.

The FFP3 respirator must always be
removed outside the patient’s room.
Where possible (dedicated
isolation room with ante room) the
process should be supervised by a
buddy at a distance of 2 metres to
reduce the risk of the healthcare
worker removing PPE and
inadvertently contaminating
themselves while doffing.
The FFP3 respirator should be
removed in the anteroom/lobby. In
the absence of an anteroom/lobby,
remove FFP3 respirator in a safe area
(e.g., outside the isolation room).
All PPE must be disposed of as

1. Introduction
This document outlines the infection prevention and control advice for healthcare workers
involved in receiving, assessing and caring for patients who are a possible or confirmed case of
COVID-19.
It is based on the best evidence available from previous pandemic and inter-
pandemic periods and focuses on the infection prevention and control aspects of this disease
only, recognising that a preparedness plan will consider other counter measures.
The infection prevention and control advice in this document is considered good practice in
response to this COVID-19 pandemic.
N.B. The emerging evidence base on COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. Further updates may
be made to this guidance as new detail or evidence emerges.
1.1 Scope and purpose
This document provides guidance and information on infection prevention and control
procedures to inform and advise local healthcare planning for COVID-19. This guidance has
been written for the NHS, but the infection prevention and control principles apply to other
settings where healthcare is delivered. It is issued jointly by the Department of Health and
Social Care (DHSC), Public Health Wales (PHW), Public Health Agency (PHA) Northern
Ireland, Health Protection Scotland (HPS) and Public Health England as official guidance.
Whilst this guidance seeks to ensure a consistent and resilient UK wide approach, some
differences in operational details and organisational responsibilities may apply in Northern
Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland.

2. Transmission characteristics of COVID-
19 and principles of infection prevention
and control
2.1 Routes of transmission
Infection control advice is based on the reasonable assumption that the transmission
characteristics of COVID-19 are similar to those of the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak. The initial
phylogenetic and immunologic similarities between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV can be
extrapolated to gain insight into some of the epidemiological characteristics. The transmission
of COVID-19 is thought to occur mainly through respiratory droplets generated by coughing and
sneezing, and through contact with contaminated surfaces.1
The predominant modes of
transmission are assumed to be droplet and contact.
For SARS-CoV, there is limited evidence
from observational studies showing a protective effect of up to 80% of masks and N95
respirators (the US equivalent of UK FFP2 respirators) used by healthcare workers however the
evidence base is sparse and indications (and compliance) for mask/respirator use in these
studies varied.2 It should be noted that N95 respirators are not recommended for use in UK
healthcare settings. In the UK, FFP3 respirators should be worn for airborne precautions and
must be compliant with BS EN149:200.1 For SARS-CoV, evidence suggests that use of both
respirators and surgical face masks offer a similar level of protection, both associated with up to
an 80% reduction in risk of infection.2 During AGPs there is an increased risk of aerosol spread
of infectious agents irrespective of the mode of transmission (contact, droplet, or airborne)
(Section 6.5 AGPs), and airborne precautions must be implemented when performing AGPs,
including those carried out on a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.
In light of the above, the Department of Health and Social Care’s New and Emerging
Respiratory Virus Threat Assessment Group (NERVTAG) have recommended that airborne
precautions should be implemented at all times in clinical areas considered AGP ‘hot spots’ e.g.
Intensive Care Units (ICU), Intensive Therapy Units (ITU) or High Dependency Units (HDU) that
are managing COVID-19 patients (unless patients are isolated in a negative pressure isolation
room/or single room, where only staff entering the room need wear a respirator).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 8 of 49
In other areas a fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask (FRSM) is recommended; all general
ward staff, community, ambulance and social care staff should wear an FRSM for close patient
contact (within 1 metre), unless performing an AGP, when a filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3)
respirator, eye protection, a disposable long sleeved gown and gloves should be worn.
Initial research has identified the presence of live COVID-19 virus in the stools and conjunctival
secretions of confirmed cases.1
All secretions (except sweat) and excretions, including
diarrhoeal stools from patients with known or suspected COVID-19, should be regarded as
potentially infectious.
2.2 Incubation and infectious period
Assessment of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 cases suggests
that, similar to SARS-CoV, patients will not be infectious until the onset of symptoms.
In most
cases, individuals are usually considered infectious while they have symptoms; how infectious
individuals are, depends on the severity of their symptoms and stage of their illness. The median
time from symptom onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately 2 weeks and is 3-6
weeks for severe or critical cases.3
There have been case reports that suggest infectivity
during the asymptomatic period, with one patient found to be shedding virus before the onset of
symptoms.4
Further study is required to determine the actual occurrence and impact of
asymptomatic transmission.
Precautions in section 5: Standard Infection Control Precautions (SICPs) and section 6:
Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs) should remain in place until symptoms resolve.
From international data, the balance of evidence is that infectivity has significantly reduced 7
days after the onset of symptoms.
2.3 Survival in the environment
In light of limited data for SARS-CoV-2, evidence was assessed from studies conducted with
previous human coronaviruses including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Human coronaviruses
can survive on inanimate objects and can remain viable for up to 5 days at temperatures of 22-
25°C and relative humidity of 40-50% (which is typical of air-conditioned indoor environments).1
Survival on environmental surfaces is also dependent on the surface type.1
An experimental
study using a SARS-CoV-2 strain reported viability on plastic for up to 72 hours, for 48 hours on
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 9 of 49
stainless steel and up to 8 hours on copper.1 Viability was quantified by end-point titration on
Vero E6 cells. Extensive environmental contamination may occur following an aerosol
generating procedure (AGP). The rate of clearance of aerosols in an enclosed space is
dependent on the extent of any mechanical/natural ventilation – the greater the number of air
changes per hour (ventilation rate), the sooner any aerosol will be cleared.5 The time required
for clearance of aerosols, and thus the time after which the room can be entered without a
filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirator, can be determined by the number of air changes
per hour (ACH) as outlined in WHO guidance; in general wards and single rooms there should
be a minimum of 6 air changes per hour, in negative-pressure isolation rooms there should be
a minimum of 12 air changes per hour.6 Where feasible, environmental
decontamination
should be performed when it is considered appropriate to enter the room/area without an FFP3
respirator. A single air change is estimated to remove 63% of airborne contaminants, after 5 air
changes less than 1% of airborne contamination is thought to remain.7 A minimum of 20
minutes i.e. 2 air changes, in hospital settings where the majority of these procedures occur is
considered pragmatic.
The precautions described in section 5.2: Hand hygiene and section 6.6: Management of
patient care environment and equipment should be followed.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.

3. Organisational preparedness for
preventing and controlling COVID-19
Limiting transmission of COVID-19 in the healthcare setting requires a range of infection
prevention and control measures which can be considered as a hierarchy of controls.
Administrative controls are implemented at an organisational level (e.g. the design and use of
appropriate processes, systems and engineering controls, and provision and use of suitable
work equipment and materials) to help prevent the introduction of infection and to control and
limit the transmission of infection in healthcare. The control of exposure at source, including
adequate ventilation systems and effective environmental decontamination will physically
reduce exposure to infection. Employers are under a legal obligation – under control of
substances hazardous to health (COSHH) – to adequately control the risk of exposure to
hazardous substances where exposure cannot be prevented. The provision and use of personal
protective equipment (PPE), including respiratory protective equipment (RPE), will protect staff,
patients and visitors. Employees have an obligation to make full and proper use of any control
measures, including PPE, provided by their employer. The principles below are listed as a
hierarchy of infection prevention and control measures at a local hospital/ward level. (Note that
this list is not exhaustive but includes key principles and illustrates a useful approach to
preventing and controlling COVID-19).
Hierarchy of Control measures:
● Early recognition/reporting of cases;
● Early assessment/triaging of cases;
● Implementing control measures, including:
– maintaining separation in space and/or time between suspected and confirmed
COVID-19 patients,
– educating staff, patients and visitors about Standard infection control precautions
(SICPs) and Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs),
– prompt implementation of TBPs to limit transmission,
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 11 of 49
– restricting access of ill visitors to the facility,
– instructing staff members with symptoms to stay at home and not come to work until
symptoms resolve,
– planning and implementation of strategies for surge capacity.
In preparedness for implementing these control measures all healthcare organisations should
undertake planning, and test the preparedness response for the various phases of a pandemic.
This includes:
● An assessment of their facilities’ current capabilities. Healthcare services will not be able
to operate under ‘business as usual’ during a COVID-19 pandemic. An assessment of
the practical ability to deliver care and implement control measures under the pressure
of an exceptional number of patient admissions and reduced staff numbers due to illness
must be assessed; ensuring their facilities’ most current blueprints are readily available
and accessible if needed to make necessary changes;
● An assessment of the current workforce;
● Working in a multidisciplinary team with healthcare and social care leaders/managers,
engineering, and clinical staff to plan for segregation of patients and/or services and
creation of adequate isolation rooms; identifying potential areas that could be converted
effectively with minimum modifications; and
● Defining engineering, administrative, and personnel requirements that can be efficiently
implemented during a pandemic COVID-19 event.8

4. Infection prevention and control
precautions
Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission based precautions (TBPs)
must be used when managing patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
4.1 Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) definition
Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) are the basic infection prevention and control
measures necessary to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious agents from both
recognised and unrecognised sources. Sources include blood and other body fluids, secretions
and excretions (excluding sweat), non-intact skin or mucous membranes, and any equipment or
items in the care environment. SICPs should be used by all staff, in all care settings, at all
times, for all patients.
4.2 Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs) definition
Transmission based precautions (TBPs) are applied when SICPs alone are insufficient to
prevent cross transmission of an infectious agent. TBPs are additional infection control
precautions required when caring for a patient with a known or suspected infectious agent.
TBPs are categorised by the route of transmission of the infectious agent:
4.3 Routes of transmission:
● Contact precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission via direct
contact or indirectly from the immediate care environment (including care equipment).
This is the most common route of infection transmission.
● Droplet precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission over short
distances via droplets (>5μm) from the respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a
mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory
system to above the alveolar level. The maximum distance for cross transmission from
droplets has not been definitively determined, although a distance of approximately
1 metre (3 feet) around the infected individual has frequently been reported in the
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 13 of 49
medical literature as the area of risk.7, 9
● Airborne precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission without
necessarily having close contact via aerosols (≤5μm) from the respiratory tract of one
individual directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Aerosols
penetrate the respiratory system to the alveolar level.
Interrupting transmission of COVID-19 requires both droplet and contact precautions; if an
aerosol generating procedure (AGP) is being undertaken then airborne precautions are
required in addition to contact precautions.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.

5. Standard infection control precautions
(SICPs)
5.1 Patient placement/assessment for infection risk
Patients must be promptly assessed for infection risk on arrival at the care area and, if possible,
prior to accepting a patient from another care area. Patients should be continuously reviewed
throughout their inpatient stay. In all healthcare settings, patients with symptoms of COVID-19
should be segregated from non-symptomatic patients as promptly as possible.
5.2 Hand hygiene
Hand hygiene is essential to reduce the transmission of infection in health and other care settings
and is a critical element of standard infection control precautions (SICPs). All staff, patients and
visitors should decontaminate their hands with alcohol based hand rub (ABHR) when entering
and leaving areas where care for –suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients is being
delivered.
Hand hygiene must be performed immediately before every episode of direct patient care and
after any activity or contact that potentially results in hands becoming contaminated, including
the removal of personal protective equipment (PPE), equipment decontamination and waste
handling: https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Your_5_Moments_For_Hand_Hygiene_Poster.pdf
Before performing hand hygiene:
● expose forearms (bare below the elbows);
● remove all hand and wrist jewellery (a single, plain metal finger ring is permitted but
should be removed (or moved up) during hand hygiene);
● ensure finger nails are clean, short and that artificial nails or nail products are not worn;
● cover all cuts or abrasions with a waterproof dressing.
https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Your_5_Moments_For_Hand_Hygiene_Poster.pdf
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 15 of 49
Technique for hand washing and rubbing
● Hand hygiene includes the use of ABHR for routine hand hygiene and hand washing with
soap and water, including thorough drying, if hands are visibly soiled or dirty.
● The technique for hand washing must be carried out thoroughly and for a time period
sufficient to inactivate the virus i.e. 40 to 60 seconds. See Appendix 1 – Best practice
how to hand wash.
● ABHR must be available for all staff as near to point of care as possible, where this is not
practical, personal dispensers should be used. The technique for use of ABHR to
decontaminate hands must be carried out thoroughly and for a time period sufficient to
inactivate the virus i.e. 20 to 30 seconds. See Appendix 2.
● Where no running water is available or hand hygiene facilities are lacking, such as in a
patient’s home, staff may use hand wipes followed by ABHR and should wash their
hands at the first available opportunity.
5.3 Respiratory and cough hygiene – ‘Catch it, bin it, kill it’
Patients, staff and visitors should be encouraged to minimise potential COVID-19 transmission
through good respiratory hygiene measures:
● Disposable, single-use tissues should be used to cover the nose and mouth when
sneezing, coughing or wiping and blowing the nose. Used tissues should be disposed of
promptly in the nearest waste bin.
● Tissues, waste bins (lined and foot operated) and hand hygiene facilities should be
available for patients, visitors and staff.
● Hands should be cleaned (using soap and water if possible, otherwise using ABHR) after
coughing, sneezing, using tissues or after any contact with respiratory secretions and
contaminated objects.
● Encourage patients to keep hands away from the eyes, mouth and nose.
● Some patients (e.g. the elderly and children) may need assistance with containment of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 16 of 49
respiratory secretions; those who are immobile will need a container (e.g. a plastic bag)
readily at hand for immediate disposal of tissues.
● In common waiting areas or during transportation, symptomatic patients may wear a
fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical face mask (FRSM), if tolerated, to minimise the
dispersal of respiratory secretions and reduce environmental contamination.
5.4 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Before undertaking any procedure, staff should assess any likely exposure and ensure PPE is
worn that provides adequate protection against the risks associated with the procedure or task
being undertaken. All staff should be trained in the proper use of all PPE that they may be
required to wear.
In addition:
● Staff who have had and recovered from COVID-19 should continue to follow infection
control precautions, including the PPE recommended in this document.
All PPE should be:
● compliant with the relevant BS/EN standards (European technical standards as adopted
in the UK);
● located close to the point of use;
● stored to prevent contamination in a clean/dry area until required for use (expiry dates
must be adhered to);
● single-use only;
● changed immediately after each patient and/or following completion of a procedure or task;
and
● disposed of after use into the correct waste stream i.e. healthcare/clinical waste (this may
require disposal via orange or yellow bag waste; local guidance will be provided depending
on the impact of the disease)
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 17 of 49
5.4.1 Disposable apron/gown
Disposable plastic aprons must be worn to protect staff uniform or clothes from contamination
when providing direct patient care and during environmental and equipment decontamination.
Fluid-resistant gowns must be worn when a disposable plastic apron provides inadequate cover
of staff uniform or clothes for the procedure/task being performed and when there is a risk of
extensive splashing of blood and/or other body fluids e.g. during aerosol generating procedures
(AGPs). If non fluid-resistant gowns are used, a disposable plastic apron should be worn
underneath.
Disposable aprons and gowns must be changed between patients and immediately after
completion of a procedure/task.
5.4.2 Disposable gloves
Disposable gloves must be worn when providing direct patient care and when exposure to
blood and/or other body fluids is anticipated/likely, including during equipment and
environmental decontamination. Gloves must be changed immediately following the care
episode or the task undertaken.
5.4.3 Eye protection/Face visor
Eye/face protection should be worn when there is a risk of contamination to the eyes from
splashing of secretions (including respiratory secretions), blood, body fluids or excretions. An
individual risk assessment should be carried out prior to/at the time of providing care.
Disposable, single-use, eye/face protection is recommended.
Eye/face protection can be achieved by the use of any one of the following:
● surgical mask with integrated visor;
● full face shield/visor;
● polycarbonate safety spectacles or equivalent;
Regular corrective spectacles are not considered adequate eye protection.
See Appendix 3 for the correct order of donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 18 of 49
5.5 Safe management of linen (laundry)
No special procedures are required; linen is categorised as ‘used’ or ‘infectious’. All linen used
in the direct care of patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 should be managed as
‘infectious’ linen. Linen must be handled, transported and processed in a manner that prevents
exposure to the skin and mucous membranes of staff, contamination of their clothing and the
environment:
Disposable gloves and an apron should be worn when handling infectious linen.
All linen should be handled inside the patient room/cohort area. A laundry receptacle should be
available as close as possible to the point of use for immediate linen deposit.
When handling linen do not:
● rinse, shake or sort linen on removal from beds/trolleys;
● place used/infectious linen on the floor or any other surfaces e.g. a locker/table top;
● re-handle used/infectious linen once bagged;
● overfill laundry receptacles; or
● place inappropriate items in the laundry receptacle e.g. used equipment/needles.
When managing infectious linen:
● place directly into a water-soluble/alginate bag and secure;
● place the water-soluble bag inside a clear polythene bag and secure;
● place the polythene bag into in the appropriately coloured (as per local policy) linen bag
(hamper).
All linen bags/receptacles must be tagged e.g. ward/care area and date. Store all
used/infectious linen in a designated, safe, lockable area whilst awaiting uplift. Organisational
preparedness plans should consider the safe storage of excess linen awaiting collection and for
maintaining supplies of clean linen for patient use.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 19 of 49
5.6 Staff uniforms/clothes
The appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) will protect staff uniform from
contamination in most circumstances. Healthcare facilities should provide changing
rooms/areas where staff can change into uniforms on arrival at work.
Organisations may consider the use of theatre scrubs for staff who do not usually wear a
uniform but who are likely to come into close contact with patients e.g. medical staff.
Healthcare laundry services should be used to launder staff uniforms. If there is no laundry
facility available, then uniforms should be transported home in a disposable plastic bag. This
bag should be disposed of into the household waste stream.
Uniforms should be laundered:
● separately from other household linen;
● in a load not more than half the machine capacity;
● at the maximum temperature the fabric can tolerate, then ironed or tumbled-dried.
NB. It is best practice to change into and out of uniforms at work and not wear them when
travelling; this is based on public perception rather than evidence of an infection risk. This does
not apply to community health workers who are required to travel between patients in the same
uniform.
5.7 Management of blood and body fluid spills
Spillages must be decontaminated in line with local policy. For an example, see Appendix 4.
5.8 Management of healthcare (including clinical) and non-clinical waste
Large volumes of waste may be generated by frequent use of PPE; advice from the local waste
management team should be sought prospectively on how to manage this.
Dispose of all waste as clinical waste.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 20 of 49
Waste from a possible or a confirmed case must be disposed of as Category B waste. The
transport of Category B waste is described in Health Technical Memorandum 07-01: Safe
management of healthcare waste. Disposal of all waste related to possible or confirmed cases
should be classified as infectious clinical waste suitable for alternative treatment, unless the
waste has other properties that would require it to be incinerated.
6. Transmission based precautions (TBPs)
for pandemic COVID-19
In addition to standard infection control precautions (SICPs), droplet precautions should be used
for patients known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19 in all healthcare settings.
● COVID-19 virus is expelled as droplets from the respiratory tract of an infected individual
(e.g. during coughing and sneezing) directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctiva of a
susceptible individual(s) or environmental surface(s).
● Droplets travel only short distances through the air; a distance of at least 1 metre has
been used for deploying droplet precautions.
However, this distance should be
considered as the minimum rather than an absolute:
● Transmission based precautions (TBPs (droplet) should be continued until the resolution
of the patient’s fever and respiratory symptoms.
6.1 Duration of precautions
Patients should remain in isolation/cohort with TBPs applied until the resolution of fever and
respiratory symptoms. The duration of TBPs may require modification based on the intelligence
gathered about COVID-19.
Patients can be discharged before resolution of symptoms provided they are deemed clinically
fit for discharge and should be advised to self-isolate as per staying at home guidance.
Discharge to long term care facilities should be discussed and agreed locally.
The decision to modify the duration of, or ‘stand down’ TBPs should be made by the clinical

Page 21 of 49
team managing the patient(s); based on patient condition and in agreement with the local
Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT).
6.2 Segregation and cohorting (inpatient settings)
6.2.1 Negative pressure isolation rooms
Special environmental controls, such as negative pressure isolation rooms, are not necessary
to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. However, in the early stages, and in high risk
settings, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may be isolated in negative pressure
rooms.
6.2.2 Single rooms
Wherever possible, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed in single
rooms. In an escalating situation there is however likely to be a lack of single rooms/isolation
facilities.
Where single/isolation rooms are in short supply, and cohorting is not yet considered
possible (patient(s) awaiting laboratory confirmation), prioritise patients who have excessive
cough and sputum production for single/isolation room placement.
Single rooms in COVID-19 segregated areas should, wherever possible, be reserved for
performing aerosol generating procedures (AGPs).
Single rooms in non-COVID-19 areas should be reserved for patients requiring isolation for
other (non-influenza-like illness) reasons.
The prioritising of patients for isolation other than suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients
should be decided locally, based on patient need and local resources.
6.2.3 Cohort areas
If a single/isolation room is not available, cohort confirmed respiratory infected patients with
other patients confirmed to have COVID-19. Ensure patients are physically separated; a
distance of at least 1 metre. Use privacy curtains between the beds to minimise opportunities
for close contact. Where possible, a designated self-contained area or wing of the healthcare
facility should be used for the treatment and care of patients with COVID-19. This area should:
● include a reception area that is separate from the rest of the facility and should, if
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 22 of 49
feasible, have a separate entrance/exit from the rest of the building;
● not be used as a thoroughfare by other patients, visitors or staff, including patients being
transferred, staff going for meal breaks, and staff and visitors entering and exiting the
building;
● be separated from non-segregated areas by closed doors; and
● have signage displayed warning of the segregated area to control entry.
Hospitals should consider creating cohort areas which differentiate the level of care required.
It
may also be prudent to consider:
● the need for cohorting in single/mixed sex wards/bays
● underlying patient condition (immunocompromised);
● age groups when cohorting children; and
● routine childhood vaccination status when cohorting children.
6.2.4 Staff cohorting
Assigning a dedicated team of staff to care for patients in isolation/cohort rooms/areas is an
additional infection control measure. This should be implemented whenever there are sufficient
levels of staff available (so as not to have a negative impact on non-affected patients’ care).
Staff who have had confirmed COVID-19 and recovered should continue to follow the infection
control precautions, including personal protective equipment (PPE), as outlined in this
document (see section 7).
6.2.5 Visitors to segregated/cohort areas
Visitors to all areas of the healthcare facility should be restricted to essential visitors only, such
as parents of paediatric patients or an affected patient’s main carer. Local risk assessment and
practical management should be considered, ensuring this is a pragmatic and proportionate
response, including the consideration of whether there is a requirement for visitors to wear PPE
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 23 of 49
or respiratory protective equipment (RPE).
Visiting may be suspended if considered appropriate. All visitors entering a segregated/cohort
area must be instructed on hand hygiene. They must not visit any other care area.
Signage to support restrictions is critical. Visitors with COVID-19 symptoms must not enter the
healthcare facility. Visitors who are symptomatic should be encouraged to leave and must not
be permitted to enter areas where there are immunocompromised patients.
6.3 Patient transfers and transport
6.3.1 Intra-hospital transfers:
● The movement and transport of patients from their single room/cohort area should be
limited to essential purposes only. Staff at the receiving destination must be informed
that the patient has or is suspected to have COVID-19.
● If transport/movement is necessary, consider offering the patient a fluid-resistant (Type
IIR) surgical mask (FRSM) to be worn during transportation, to minimise the dispersal of
respiratory droplets when this can be tolerated.
● Patients must be taken straight to and returned from clinical departments and must not
wait in communal areas. If possible, patients should be placed at the end of clinical lists.
6.3.2 Transfer from primary care/community settings:
● If transfer from a primary care facility or community setting to hospital is required, the
ambulance service should be informed of the infectious status of the patient.
● Staff of the receiving ward/department should be notified in advance of any transfer and
must be informed that the patient has or is suspected to have COVID-19.
6.3.3 Inter-hospital transfers:
● Patient transfer from one healthcare facility to another should be avoided; transfer may
be undertaken if medically necessary for specialist care arising out of complications or
concurrent medical events (for example, cardiac angioplasty, and renal dialysis). If
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 24 of 49
transfer is essential, the ambulance service and receiving hospital must be advised in
advance of the infectious status of the patient.
6.4 Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Personal protective equipment (PPE) for the care of patients with COVID-19 is summarised in
Table 1, see Appendix 3 for how to put on and remove PPE.

Page 25 of 49
Fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical masks (FRSMs) are worn to protect the wearer from the
transmission of COVID-19 by respiratory droplets.
In all healthcare settings:
● A FRSM must be worn when working in close contact (within 1 metre) of a patient with
COVID-19 symptoms.
This provides a physical barrier to minimise contamination of the
mucosa of the mouth and nose.
● In an area where pandemic COVID-19 patients have been cohorted together, it may be
more practical for staff to wear a FRSM at all times, rather than only when in close
contact with a patient. Similarly, in primary care/outpatient settings it may be more
practical for staff working in a segregated (COVID-19 patient) area to wear a FRSM for
the duration they are in the patient area.
●
A FRSM for COVID-19 should:
– be well fitted covering both nose and mouth;
– not be allowed to dangle around the neck of the wearer after or between each
use;
– not be touched once put on;
– be changed when they become moist or damaged;
– be removed outside the patient room, cohort area or 1 metre away from the
patient with possible/confirmed COVID-19; and
– be worn once and then discarded as healthcare (clinical) waste (hand
hygiene must always be performed after disposal).
The provision of a FRSM for patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 at point of
assessment or triage in any healthcare setting should be considered if the patient can tolerate it
(except when in a dedicated COVID-19 area).

6.4.2 Filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirators
Filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirators should be worn whenever there is a risk of
airborne transmission of pandemic COVID-19 i.e. during aerosol generating procedures (AGPs)
and at all times in intensive care unit (ICU), intensive therapy unit (ITU), high dependency unit
(HDU) where COVID-19 patients are cohorted.
All tight fitting respiratory protective equipment (RPE) (i.e. FFP3 respirators) must be:
● single use (disposable) and fluid-resistant*. Fluid resistant FFP3’s should be worn with
appropriate eye protection;
● fit tested on all healthcare staff who may be required to wear an FFP3 respirator to
ensure an adequate seal/fit according to the manufacturers’ guidance; fit checked
(according to the manufacturers’ guidance) every time an FFP3 respirator is donned to
ensure an adequate seal has been achieved;
● compatible with other facial protection used i.e. protective eyewear so that this does not
interfere with the seal of the respiratory protection. Regular corrective spectacles are not
considered adequate eye protection;
● disposed of and replaced if breathing becomes difficult, the respirator is damaged or
distorted, the respirator becomes obviously contaminated by respiratory secretions or
other body fluids, or if a proper face fit cannot be maintained; and
● be worn once and then discarded as healthcare (clinical) waste (hand hygiene
must always be performed after disposal).
*If wearing a FFP3 that is not fluid resistant, a full face shield/ visor must be worn
A FFP3 respirator, although ‘single use’, can be worn for as long as comfortable, for example
for the duration of a ward round or providing clinical care.
Once separated from the face FFP3s must be discarded.
In the absence of an anteroom/lobby remove FFP3 respirators in a safe area (e.g. outside the
isolation/cohort room/area).
All other PPE should be removed in the patient care area.

6.5 Aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs)
Aerosols generated by medical procedures are one route for the transmission of the COVID-19
virus. The following procedures are considered to be potentially infectious AGPs:
● Intubation, extubation and related procedures;
● Tracheotomy/tracheostomy procedures;
● Manual ventilation;
● Open suctioning;
● Bronchoscopy;
● Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) e.g. Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) and
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ventilation (CPAP);
● Surgery and post-mortem procedures in which high-speed devices are used;
● High-frequency oscillating ventilation (HFOV);
● High-flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO)
● Induction of sputum (see glossary);
● Some dental procedures (e.g. high speed drilling).
For patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19, any of these potentially infectious AGPs
should only be carried out when essential. Where possible, these procedures should be carried
out in a single room with the doors shut. Only those healthcare staff who are needed to
undertake the procedure should be present. A disposable, fluid repellant surgical gown, gloves,
eye protection and a FFP3 respirator should be worn by those undertaking the procedure and
those in the room.
Certain other procedures/equipment may generate an aerosol from material other than patient
secretions but are not considered to represent a significant infectious risk. Procedures in this
category include:
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 29 of 49
● administration of pressurised humidified oxygen;
● administration of medication via nebulisation.
Note: During nebulisation, the aerosol derives from a non-patient source (the fluid in the
nebuliser chamber) and does not carry patient-derived viral particles. If a particle in the aerosol
coalesces with a contaminated mucous membrane, it will cease to be airborne and therefore
will not be part of an aerosol. Staff should use appropriate hand hygiene when helping patients
to remove nebulisers and oxygen masks.
6.6 Management of equipment and the care environment
Decontamination of equipment and the care environment must be performed using either:
● A combined detergent/disinfectant solution at a dilution of 1,000 parts per million
available chlorine (ppm available chlorine (av.cl.)); or
● A general purpose neutral detergent in a solution of warm water followed by a
disinfectant solution of 1,000ppm av.cl.
Only cleaning (detergent) and disinfectant products supplied by employers are to be used.
Products must be prepared and used according to the manufacturers’ instructions and
recommended product ""contact times"" must be followed. If alternative cleaning
agents/disinfectants are to be used, they should only on the advice of the IPCT and conform to
EN standard 14476 for virucidal activity
6.6.1 Equipment
Patient care equipment should be single-use items if possible. Reusable (communal) non-
invasive equipment should as far as possible be allocated to the individual patient or cohort of
patients.
Reusable (communal) non-invasive equipment must be decontaminated:
● between each patient and after patient use;
● after blood and body fluid contamination; and
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 30 of 49
● at regular intervals as part of equipment cleaning.
An increased frequency of decontamination should be considered for reusable non-invasive
care equipment when used in isolation/cohort areas.
• ventilators should be protected with a high efficiency filter, such as BS EN 13328-1
• closed system suction should be used
See Appendix 4 for guidance on routine decontamination of reusable non-invasive patient care
equipment.
Avoid the use of fans that re-circulate the air.10
There is no need to use disposable plates or cutlery. Crockery and cutlery can be washed by
hand or in a dishwasher using household detergent and hand-hot water after use.
6.6.2 Environment
Patient isolations rooms, cohort areas and clinical rooms must be decontaminated at least
daily. Clinical rooms should also be decontaminated after clinical sessions for patients with
suspected/known pandemic COVID-19. In addition, patient isolation rooms must be terminally
cleaned:
● Following resolution of symptoms, discharge or transfer (this includes removal and
laundering of all curtains and bed screens);
● Once vacated by staff following an AGP. Clearance of infectious particles after an AGP
is dependent on the mechanical/natural ventilation and air change per hour(ACH) within
the room. A single air change is estimated to remove 63% of airborne contaminants;
after 5 air changes, less than 1% of airborne contamination is thought to remain.
In an
isolation room with 10-12 ACH a minimum of 20 minutes is considered pragmatic; in a
side room with 6 ACH this would be approximately 1 hour. Advice should be sought from
the local Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT).
An increased frequency of decontamination should be incorporated into the environmental
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 31 of 49
decontamination schedules for areas where there may be higher environmental contamination
rates e.g.
● toilets/commodes particularly if patients have diarrhoea; and
● “frequently touched” surfaces such as medical equipment, door/toilet handles and locker
tops, patient call bells, over bed tables and bed rails should be cleaned at least twice
daily and when known to be contaminated with secretions, excretions or body fluids.
Domestic/cleaning staff performing environmental decontamination should:
● be allocated to specific area(s) and not be moved between COVID-19 and non-COVID-
19 care areas;
● be trained in which personal protective equipment (PPE) to use and the correct methods
of wearing, removing and disposing of PPE. The care environment should be kept clean
and clutter free. All non-essential items including toys, books and magazines should be
removed from reception and waiting areas, consulting and treatment rooms, emergency
departments, day rooms and lounges.
When made available, these items should not be
shared. All toys must be cleanable and should be cleaned regularly (preferably at the
same time as the environment).
6.7 Handling dead bodies
The principles of Standard Infection Control Precautions (SICPs) and Transmission Based
Precautions (TBPs) continue to apply whilst deceased individuals remain in the care
environment. This is due to the ongoing risk of infectious transmission via contact although the
risk is usually lower than for living patients. Where the deceased was known or suspected to
have been infected with COVID-19, there is no requirement for a body bag, and viewing,
hygienic preparations, post-mortem and embalming are all permitted.
Following a risk assessment of the potential post-mortem risk pathways PHE has developed
this advice in line with the principles set out in the HSE guidance for droplet transmission risk
as set out in: ‘Managing infection risks when handling the deceased: Guidance for the
mortuary, post-mortem room and funeral premises, and during exhumation’.

Page 32 of 49
7. Occupational health and staff
deployment
Prompt recognition of cases of COVID-19 among healthcare staff is essential to limit the
spread. Healthcare staff with influenza-like illness should not come to work. As a general
principle, healthcare staff who provide care in areas for suspected/confirmed patients should not
care for other patients, although exceptions may be necessary.
A risk assessment is required for health and social care staff at high risk of complications from
COVID-19, including pregnant staff. Employers should:
● Discuss with employees who are at risk or are pregnant the need to be deployed away from
areas used for the care of those who have, or are clinically suspected of having, COVID-19;
or, in the primary care setting, from clinics set up to manage people with COVID-19
symptoms.
● Ensure that advice is available to all healthcare staff, including specific advice to those at
risk from complications.
Bank, agency and locum staff should follow the same deployment advice as permanent staff.
As part of their employer’s duty of care, providers have a role to play in ensuring that a fit
testing programme is in place for those who may need to wear filtering face piece (class 3)
(FFP3) respirator. In the event of a breach in infection control procedures e.g. an incorrectly worn
FFP3 respirator during a potentially infectious aerosol generating procedure (AGP, staff should
be reviewed by occupational health.
Occupational health departments should lead on the implementation of systems to monitor staff
illness and absence.
Where possible, staff who have had confirmed COVID-19 (early in the stages of the outbreak
this would be via virology confirmation, thereafter, this is likely to be as per case definition)
should work in the cohort areas and care for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients. Such
staff should continue to follow the infection control precautions, including personal protective
equipment (PPE), as outlined in this document.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 33 of 49
8. Specific settings
The following guidance is given to assist specific care settings to implement the principles of
standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission based precautions (TBPs)
described in this document, which apply in all care settings.
8.1 Care home settings
Isolation within a care home for a known/suspected infection can be achieved in the persons’
bedroom in most cases. Residents should remain in their bedroom whilst considered infectious
(as described above) and the door should remain closed (if unable to isolate the individual then
this should be documented).
8.2 Primary care
In primary care settings (e.g. General Practitioner (GP) practices) suspected COVID-19
patients should be segregated in place or time from other patients, this may be achieved by:
● Creating a separate area within the facility for care of suspected patients, including
separate waiting and reception areas if possible. The area should be separated from
non-segregated areas by closed doors. To control entry, signage should be displayed
warning of the segregated area.
● Alternatively, suspected patients should be seen at a different time from other patients,
with disinfection of shared areas taking place between different clinics.
● GP practices may make arrangements for distinct COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 clinics.
(Non-essential GP clinics may need to be cancelled to enable this).
● Primary care staff should, wherever possible be allocated to either COVID-19
or
other patients.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 34 of 49
8.3 Outpatient settings
For patients who develop symptoms and have long term health conditions that require
attendance at outpatient settings e.g. hospital day care, options include:
● deferring the procedure and re-scheduling the next appointment;
● transferring the patient to a designated hospital with isolation or cohort facilities;
● introducing physical barriers such as screens in special units to separate patients with
symptoms of COVID-19.
8.4 Dental surgeries
Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 should not be seen for routine dental care. If a dental
emergency is suspected such as severe haemorrhaging or difficulty in breathing the patient
should be seen in a hospital environment.
If emergency dental care is required staff in attendance should be kept to a minimum and must
wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (see table 1) particularly if this involves
high speed drilling section 6.5.
8.5 Home visits
Home visits should continue as long as required to patients without COVID-19. If it becomes
necessary to suspend some home visits, alternative arrangements must be put in place to
maintain contact (e.g. telephone liaison). Health and social care staff performing non-deferrable
essential visits (for example, child protection) to households with suspected/confirmed COVID-
19, should follow the infection control precautions in this document.
8.6 Ambulances
In ambulances, patient segregation can be achieved by:
● designating an ambulance(s) for transfer of patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19
for the duration of each shift;
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 35 of 49
● transporting coughing and sneezing patients on their own whenever possible. However, if
pressure upon the service occurs, two patients with symptoms of COVID-19 may be
transferred together and should wear a fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask (FRSM).
Depending on the stage of the pandemic and an assessment of risk, ambulance staff may be
required to wear respiratory protective equipment (RPE). This will be determined locally.
8.7 Emergency departments and acute assessment units
Emergency departments and acute assessment units may be overwhelmed with patients
seeking care during the peak of a pandemic. Alternative approaches to triage and initial
assessment will be required to:
● rapidly screen and identify those who have symptoms of COVID-19 upon their arrival;
● separate symptomatic patients from others to reduce the risk of transmission; and
● determine as early as possible the type of care patients will require (i.e. see and
discharge or admit for treatment).
8.7.1 Screening and triage
Signage should be displayed prior to and on entry to assessment units instructing patients with
symptoms to inform reception staff immediately on their arrival.
A triage practitioner(s) should be based in the reception to manage patient flow, including
deferral of patients who do not require emergency care.
8.7.2 Reception area
Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 should be triaged to a segregated waiting and
assessment area immediately. Patients should be instructed to stay in this waiting area and not
visit other departments or, parts of the hospital/unit, or go to public areas such as the cafeteria.
Signage and physical barriers should be used as appropriate.
If separate areas for patients with symptoms of COVID-19 cannot be established, an alternative
area/site should be set up for those at highest risk of complications from COVID-19 and who do
not have respiratory symptoms (e.g. patients presenting for dialysis, patients with a history of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 36 of 49
blood cell or organ transplantation, chemotherapy, or who are immunocompromised for other
reasons).
Patients who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 but require prompt acute care assessment
should be triaged to a specific waiting and examination area, physically separate from the
COVID-19 waiting and assessment area.
8.7.3Critical care
PPE must be worn:
• all respiratory equipment must be protected with a high efficiency filter (such as BS EN 13328-
1). This filter must be disposed of after use
• disposable respiratory equipment should be used wherever possible. Re-usable equipment
must, as a minimum, be decontaminated in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
• a closed suctioning system must be used
• ventilator circuits should not be broken unless necessary
• ventilators must be placed on standby when carrying out bagging
8.7.4 Theatres
• theatres must be informed in advance of a patient transfer of a confirmed or possible COVID-
19 positive case
• the patient should be transported directly to the operating theatre and should wear a surgical
mask if it can be tolerated
• the patient should be anaesthetised and recovered in the theatre. Staff should wear protective
clothing but only those at risk of exposure from aerosol generating procedures, i.e during
intubation need to wear FFP3 respirators and full gowns. considerations about the use of
respiratory/anaesthetic equipment are addressed in the critical care section above
• instruments and devices should be decontaminated in the normal manner in accordance with
manufacturers’ advice
• both laryngoscope handle and blade should either be single use or reprocessed in the Sterile
Supply Department. Video laryngoscope blades should be single use and scope/handle
decontaminated as per manufacture instructions.
• the theatre should be cleaned as per local policy for infected cases, paying particular attention
to hand contact points on the anaesthetic machine
• theatres should not be used by staff or patients for 20 minutes after the patient leaves if
conventionally ventilated, or 5 minutes if ultraclean ventilation is used
• possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19 should be placed at the end of the list where feasible

Appendix 7 Glossary
Aerosol-generating procedures
(AGPs)
Certain medical and patient care activities that
can result in the release of airborne particles
(aerosols). AGPs can create a risk of airborne
transmission of infections that are usually only
spread by droplet transmission.
Airborne Transmission
The spread of infection from one person to
another by airborne particles (aerosols)
containing infectious agents.
Airborne particles
Very small particles that may contain
infectious agents. They can remain in the air for
long periods of time and can be carried over
long distances by air currents. Airborne particles
can be released when a person coughs
or sneezes, and during aerosol generating
procedures (AGPs). “Droplet nuclei” are
aerosols formed from the evaporation of larger
droplet particles (see Droplet Transmission).
Aerosols formed from droplet particles in this
way behave as other aerosols.
Airborne precautions Measures used to prevent and control infections
spread without necessarily having close patient
contact via aerosols (less than or equal to 5μm)
from the respiratory tract of one individual
directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae
of another individual. Aerosols can penetrate the
respiratory system to the alveolar level.
BS/EN standards
Mandatory technical specifications created by
either the British Standards Institute (BS) or
European Standardisation Organisations (EN) in
collaboration with government bodies, industry
experts and trade associations. They aim to
ensure the quality and safety of products,
services and systems.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 44 of 49
Cohort area
An area (room, bay, ward) in which two or more
patients (a cohort) with the same confirmed
infection are placed. A cohort area should be
physically separate from other patients.
Contact precautions
Measures used to prevent and control infections
that spread via direct contact with the patient or
indirectly from the patient’s immediate care
environment (including care equipment). This is
the most common route of infection
transmission.
Contact transmission Contact transmission is the most common route
of transmission, and consists of two distinct
types: direct contact and indirect contact. Direct
transmission occurs when microorganisms are
transmitted directly from an infectious individual
to another individual without the involvement of
another contaminated person or object (fomite).
Indirect transmission occurs when
microorganisms are transmitted from an
infectious individual to another individual through
a contaminated object or person (fomite) or
person.
COVID-19 COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory
disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The
disease was discovered in China in December
2019 and has since spread around the world.
Droplet precautions
Measures used to prevent and control infections
spread over short distances (at least 1 metre (3
feet) via droplets (greater than 5μm) from the
respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a
mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another
individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory
system to above the alveolar level.
Droplet transmission
The spread of infection from one person to
another by droplets containing infectious agents.
Eye/Face protection
Worn when there is a risk from splashing of
secretion (including respiratory secretions),
eye/face protection can be achieved by the use
of any one of the following: a surgical mask with
integrated visor; a full face visor/shield; or
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 45 of 49
polycarbonate safety spectacles or equivalent;
FFP3 Respiratory protection that is worn over the nose
and mouth designed to protect the wearer from
inhaling hazardous substances, including
airborne particles (aerosols). FFP stands for
filtering face piece. There are three categories of
FFP respirator: FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3. An FFP3
respirator provides the highest level of
protection, and is the only category of respirator
legislated for use in UK healthcare settings.
Fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical face
mask (FRSM)
A disposable fluid-resistant mask worn over the
nose and mouth to protect the mucous
membranes of the wearer’s nose and mouth
from splashes and infectious droplets. FRSMs
can also be used to protect patients.
When
recommended for infection control purposes a
'surgical face mask' typically denotes a
fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask.
Fluid-resistant
A term applied to fabrics that resist liquid
penetration, often used interchangeably with
'fluid-repellent' when describing the properties of
protective clothing or equipment.
Frequently touched surfaces
Surfaces of the environment which are
commonly touched/come into contact with
human hands.
High Consequence Infectious Disease
(HCID)
In the UK, a high consequence infectious disease
(HCID) is defined according to the following
criteria: Acute infectious disease; typically has a
high case-fatality rate; may not have effective
prophylaxis or treatment; often difficult to
recognise and detect rapidly; ability to spread in
the community and within healthcare settings; and
requires an enhanced individual, population and
system response to ensure it is managed
effectively, efficiently and safely.
Healthcare/clinical waste Waste produced as a result of healthcare
activities for example soiled dressings, sharps.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 46 of 49
High risk units
Intensive care units, intensive therapy units and
high dependency units.
Incubation period
The period between the infection of an individual
by a pathogen and the manifestation of the illness
or disease it causes.
Induction of sputum Induction of sputum typically involves the
administration of nebulised saline to moisten and
loosen respiratory secretions (this may be
accompanied by chest physiotherapy (percussion
and vibration)) to induce forceful coughing.
Infectious linen
Linen that has been used by a patient who is
known or suspected to be infectious and/or linen
that is contaminated with blood and/or other body
fluids e.g. faeces.
Long term health condition
Defined as:
• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
bronchitis, emphysema or asthma
• Heart disease
• Kidney disease
• Liver disease
• Stroke or a transient ischaemic attack (TIA)
• Diabetes
• Lowered immunity as a result of disease or
medical treatment, such as steroid
medication or cancer treatment
• Neurological condition, such as
Parkinson's disease, motor neurone
disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), cerebral
palsy, or a learning disability
• Problem with spleen, including sickle cell
disease, or had spleen removed
• A BMI of 40 or above (obese).
Negative pressure isolation room
A room which maintains permanent negative
pressure i.e. air flow is from the outside adjacent
space (e.g. corridor) into the room and then
exhausted to the outdoors.

New and emerging viruses (including
respiratory viruses)
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) defines emerging infectious diseases as:
• New infections resulting from changes in or
evolution of existing organisms.
• Known infections spreading to new
geographical areas or populations.
• Previously unrecognised infections
appearing in areas undergoing ecological
transformation.
• Old infections re-emerging as a result of
antibiotic resistance in known agents or
breakdown in public health measures.
Personal Protective Equipment
(PPE)
Equipment a person wears to protect themselves
from risks to their health or safety, including
exposure to infection agents. The level of PPE
required depends on: Suspected/known infectious
agent; severity of the illness caused; transmission
route of the infectious agent; and the
procedure/task being undertaken.
Respiratory droplets
A small droplet, such as a particle of moisture
released from the mouth during coughing,
sneezing, or speaking.
Respiratory symptoms ‘Respiratory symptoms’ include rhinorrhoea
(runny nose); sore throat; cough; difficulty
breathing or shortness of breath.
Segregation
Physically separating or isolating from other
people.

and do not move between different patient
cohorts. Patient cohorts may include for example
‘symptomatic’, ‘asymptomatic and exposed’, or
‘asymptomatic and unexposed’ patient groups.
Transmission based precautions
Additional precautions to be used in addition to
SICPs when caring for patients with a known or
suspected infection or colonisation.

If COVID19 becomes an established significant epidemic in the UK, NHS and HSC services in primary
and secondary care and public health across all four nations will be put under extreme pressure. This
pressure will inevitably be exacerbated by staff shortages due to sickness or caring responsibilities. It
will be a challenge for our profession. We are confident doctors will respond rapidly and professionally
and want to assure colleagues that we recognise this will require temporary changes to practice, and
that regulators and others will take this into account.
A significant epidemic will require healthcare professionals to be flexible in what they do. It may entail
working in unfamiliar circumstances or surroundings, or working in clinical areas outside of their usual
practice for the benefit of patients and the population as a whole. This can be stressful and you may
have concerns about both the professional practicalities and implications of working in such
circumstances.
We need to stick to the basic principles of being a good doctor. All doctors are expected to follow GMC
guidance and use their judgement in applying the principles to the situations they face, but these
rightly take account of the realities of a very abnormal emergency situation. We want doctors, in
partnership with patients, always to use their professional judgement to assess risk and to make sure
people receive safe care, informed by the values and principles set out in their professional standards.
A rational approach to varying practice in an emergency is part of that professional response.
It is the responsibility of GP practices, hospitals, trusts and health boards to ensure that clinicians
working in their organisations are supported to do this. They must bear in mind that clinicians may
need to depart, possibly significantly, from established procedures in order to care for patients in the
highly challenging but time-bound circumstances of the peak of an epidemic.
We expect employers, educational supervisors, professional bodies, and national NHS and HSC
organisations to be flexible in terms of their approach and the expectations of routine requirements.
Healthcare professional regulators, including the GMC, have already committed to take into account
factors relevant to the environment in which the professional is working, including relevant
information about resources, guidelines or protocols in place at the time.
Due consideration should and will be given to healthcare professionals and other staff who are using
their skills under difficult circumstances due to lack of personnel and overwhelming demand in a major
epidemic. This may include working outside their usual scope of practice.
The healthcare regulators
have already released a joint statement to explain this.
https://www.gmc-uk.org/news/news-
archive/how-we-will-continue-to-regulate-in-light-of-novel-coronavirus
We are determined to ensure the long-term prospects of doctors in training are not compromised.
The GMC, together with the education bodies in the four nations, are considering this.
Finally, we would like to thank you all for all the efforts you are already making. Many doctors across
the NHS, HSC and public health services have already made major contributions to the response to
COVID-19. We are very proud of the response of the medical profession in many disciplines whether
clinical, public health or laboratory to this challenge. It has been exemplary. We are confident of the
commitment, dedication, professionalism and hard work the whole profession has and will continue
to have in the very testing event of a significant epidemic in the UK.

COVID-19 Ambulance Case Transport Response Service Framework
1.0 Introduction
1.1 Following the recent COVID-19 outbreak in China, the NHS is putting in place
measures to mitigate against the risks posed by COVID-19 to NHS staff, the
public and the business as usual resources of the NHS. Any response must
be reasonable and proportional.
1.2 This framework is designed to enable ambulance services to put in place all
things necessary to safely transport patients that require testing to and from
hospital.
1.3 This should be set in the context of home testing and self-isolation becoming
one of the key containment strategies in reducing the spread of the virus.
1.4 This document provides more detail and underpins the Case Transport
section (3.2) of the Minimum Operating Standards, Novel Coronavirus
(COVID-19) Patient Pathway V2.2 20/02/2020 (referred to as COVID-19
Pathway).
2.0 Information
2.1 Ambulance services are the experts in providing patient transport for the NHS
so this framework will be led by each of the 10 English ambulance services
plus Isle of Wight. It takes into consideration the infrastructure in place to
manage Accident and Emergency (A&E) services and Patient Transport
Services (PTS), the technology used in operating advanced Computer Aided
Despatch (CAD) systems, and their links with NHS 111 and other health
partners.
2.2 Patients requiring testing who either can’t be tested at home (or other
location) or need a blood test to confirm whether they are positive or negative
to the COVID-19 virus, should not use public transport and should self-isolate
once the test has been completed and await the outcome of the results.
2.3 Ambulance services are currently taking this cohort of patients from their
place of residence to hospital for testing and returning them to their home, or
place of residence, post-test.
2.4 To alleviate the additional pressure and ensure those requiring testing are
conveyed and returned in isolation of the general public, ambulance services
are requested to work with health partners and put in place a transport system
for the health communities they cover.

2.5 The COVID-19 Pathway Phase 2 Co-ordination diagram refers to the COVID-
19 Co-ordination Service and the Case Transport Response Service. They do
not need to be co-located, however, where they are not, there must be a link
between the Co-ordination Service and the Ambulance Case Transport
Response Service (CTRS).
2.6 Ambulance services are therefore required to implement as soon as possible
an Ambulance CTRS within each ambulance trust embedded in one, or
adjacent to one, of their Emergency Operations Centres (EOC) to enable call
receipt and dispatch. This should be scalable as demand increases
2.7 Each of the Ambulance CTRS will be staffed 24/7 by a manager, paramedic
and control room staff. The CTRS will provide advice to ambulance crews
conveying suspected or confirmed cases. The CTRS will ensure patients are
conveyed in accordance with national guidance in place at the time for Public
Health England input, PPE and decontamination.
2.8 The CTRS will also ensure patients are collected promptly including
discharges, to maintain flow through the COVID-19 pod etc. The CTRS will
co-ordinate all ambulance service resources used for conveying such
patients, ie E&U crews, HART for confirmed cases, PTS crews, third sector,
voluntary sector and private sector.
2.9 The CTRS will provide advice, maintain a log and report regionally and
nationally as required. Capacity of the CTRS may need to be increased and
plans should be put in place to flex capacity as and when required.
2.10 In addition ambulance services are asked to develop transport capacity and
capability to manage the demand placed on it now and for this to be scalable
as demand increases. There are a number of options for services to consider:
COVID-19
Surge Level 1
Ambulance services are utilising A&E ambulances for the
current demand, ie business as usual
COVID-19
Surge Level 2
• As demand increases (or to move it away from A&E
services), utilisation of PTS ambulances.
• Where PTS operate in some areas only, consideration
of moving PTS across commissioned boundaries within
the same ambulance trust area should be considered.
COVID-19
Surge Level 3
• Where there are no PTS commissioned services within
the operating area, consideration of using private
providers where activity outstrips available NHS
ambulance capacity.
• Voluntary Ambulance Services (VAS) provide
additional capacity across the country. Discussions
with the VAS should be considered to supplement
capacity.

2.11 It is for each ambulance service to consider how best this can be achieved,
being cognisant of their health economy.
2.12 It is likely patients with pre-existing medical conditions will also be self-
isolated. Some of these patients are likely to have appointments at hospital
and may still require their treatment to take place (oncology/renal dialysis).
2.13 There are a number of factors to be considered:
i. patients should be seated more than two metres from the driver and
wear a surgical facemask (if symptomatic). In these circumstances the
driver will not be required to wear any PPE during the journey
ii. if the ambulance crew is in closer proximity than two metres, they are
required to wear full PPE (FFP3 or powered respirator hood, eye
protection, gown/ coveralls, gloves) during the journey, and so they are
able to treat the patient should the need arise
iii. decontamination of the vehicles post transport and what is entailed for
a deep clean regime.
NHS England and NHS Improvement and PHE have produced guidance on
the areas mentioned above (previously issued to ambulance trusts).
2.14 It is for the Ambulance CTRS to determine the modality and urgency of the
transport required.
2.15 Ambulance services are asked to consider this in the context of the wider
health economy implementing other measures to both contain and reduce the
impact on emergency services. Specifically:
i. the establishment of Pods outside Emergency Departments, Minor
Injury Units, Walk in Centres and Urgent Care Centres. This is to
reduce the impact on hospital emergency departments
ii. home testing undertaken by local health care professionals from across
the local community.
2.16 It is anticipated that the volume of ambulance requests will reduce as home
testing becomes more embedded. This has commenced in some areas of the
country already and is a key component of the COVID-19 Pathway.
2.17 To aid the oversight of the national response and pressure within the system,
it is intended to add a COVID-19 surge level to the National Ambulance
Service Co-ordination Centre live Dashboard, which reflects the 3 COVID-19
surge levels described above in section 2.10.

1. Introduction
This document outlines the infection prevention and control advice for healthcare workers
involved in receiving, assessing and caring for patients who are a possible or confirmed case of
COVID-19.
It is based on the best evidence available from previous pandemic and inter-
pandemic periods and focuses on the infection prevention and control aspects of this disease
only, recognising that a preparedness plan will consider other counter measures.
The infection prevention and control advice in this document is considered good practice in
response to this COVID-19 pandemic.
N.B. The emerging evidence base on COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. Further updates may
be made to this guidance as new detail or evidence emerges.
1.1 Scope and purpose
This document provides guidance and information on infection prevention and control
procedures to inform and advise local healthcare planning for COVID-19. This guidance has
been written for the NHS, but the infection prevention and control principles apply to other
settings where healthcare is delivered. It is issued jointly by the Department of Health and
Social Care (DHSC), Public Health Wales (PHW), Public Health Agency (PHA) Northern
Ireland, Health Protection Scotland (HPS) and Public Health England as official guidance.
Whilst this guidance seeks to ensure a consistent and resilient UK wide approach, some
differences in operational details and organisational responsibilities may apply in Northern
Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland.

2. Transmission characteristics of COVID-
19 and principles of infection prevention
and control
2.1 Routes of transmission
Infection control advice is based on the reasonable assumption that the transmission
characteristics of COVID-19 are similar to those of the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak. The initial
phylogenetic and immunologic similarities between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV can be
extrapolated to gain insight into some of the epidemiological characteristics. The transmission
of COVID-19 is thought to occur mainly through respiratory droplets generated by coughing and
sneezing, and through contact with contaminated surfaces.1
The predominant modes of
transmission are assumed to be droplet and contact.
For SARS-CoV, there is limited evidence
from observational studies showing a protective effect of up to 80% of masks and N95
respirators (the US equivalent of UK FFP2 respirators) used by healthcare workers however the
evidence base is sparse and indications (and compliance) for mask/respirator use in these
studies varied.2 It should be noted that N95 respirators are not recommended for use in UK
healthcare settings. In the UK, FFP3 respirators should be worn for airborne precautions and
must be compliant with BS EN149:200.1 For SARS-CoV, evidence suggests that use of both
respirators and surgical face masks offer a similar level of protection, both associated with up to
an 80% reduction in risk of infection.2 During AGPs there is an increased risk of aerosol spread
of infectious agents irrespective of the mode of transmission (contact, droplet, or airborne)
(Section 6.5 AGPs), and airborne precautions must be implemented when performing AGPs,
including those carried out on a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.
In light of the above, the Department of Health and Social Care’s New and Emerging
Respiratory Virus Threat Assessment Group (NERVTAG) have recommended that airborne
precautions should be implemented at all times in clinical areas considered AGP ‘hot spots’ e.g.
Intensive Care Units (ICU), Intensive Therapy Units (ITU) or High Dependency Units (HDU) that
are managing COVID-19 patients (unless patients are isolated in a negative pressure isolation
room/or single room, where only staff entering the room need wear a respirator).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 8 of 49
In other areas a fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask (FRSM) is recommended; all general
ward staff, community, ambulance and social care staff should wear an FRSM for close patient
contact (within 1 metre), unless performing an AGP, when a filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3)
respirator, eye protection, a disposable long sleeved gown and gloves should be worn.
Initial research has identified the presence of live COVID-19 virus in the stools and conjunctival
secretions of confirmed cases.1
All secretions (except sweat) and excretions, including
diarrhoeal stools from patients with known or suspected COVID-19, should be regarded as
potentially infectious.
2.2 Incubation and infectious period
Assessment of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 cases suggests
that, similar to SARS-CoV, patients will not be infectious until the onset of symptoms.
In most
cases, individuals are usually considered infectious while they have symptoms; how infectious
individuals are, depends on the severity of their symptoms and stage of their illness. The median
time from symptom onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately 2 weeks and is 3-6
weeks for severe or critical cases.3
There have been case reports that suggest infectivity
during the asymptomatic period, with one patient found to be shedding virus before the onset of
symptoms.4
Further study is required to determine the actual occurrence and impact of
asymptomatic transmission.
Precautions in section 5: Standard Infection Control Precautions (SICPs) and section 6:
Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs) should remain in place until symptoms resolve.
From international data, the balance of evidence is that infectivity has significantly reduced 7
days after the onset of symptoms.
2.3 Survival in the environment
In light of limited data for SARS-CoV-2, evidence was assessed from studies conducted with
previous human coronaviruses including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Human coronaviruses
can survive on inanimate objects and can remain viable for up to 5 days at temperatures of 22-
25°C and relative humidity of 40-50% (which is typical of air-conditioned indoor environments).1
Survival on environmental surfaces is also dependent on the surface type.1
An experimental
study using a SARS-CoV-2 strain reported viability on plastic for up to 72 hours, for 48 hours on
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 9 of 49
stainless steel and up to 8 hours on copper.1 Viability was quantified by end-point titration on
Vero E6 cells. Extensive environmental contamination may occur following an aerosol
generating procedure (AGP). The rate of clearance of aerosols in an enclosed space is
dependent on the extent of any mechanical/natural ventilation – the greater the number of air
changes per hour (ventilation rate), the sooner any aerosol will be cleared.5 The time required
for clearance of aerosols, and thus the time after which the room can be entered without a
filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirator, can be determined by the number of air changes
per hour (ACH) as outlined in WHO guidance; in general wards and single rooms there should
be a minimum of 6 air changes per hour, in negative-pressure isolation rooms there should be
a minimum of 12 air changes per hour.6 Where feasible, environmental
decontamination
should be performed when it is considered appropriate to enter the room/area without an FFP3
respirator. A single air change is estimated to remove 63% of airborne contaminants, after 5 air
changes less than 1% of airborne contamination is thought to remain.7 A minimum of 20
minutes i.e. 2 air changes, in hospital settings where the majority of these procedures occur is
considered pragmatic.
The precautions described in section 5.2: Hand hygiene and section 6.6: Management of
patient care environment and equipment should be followed.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.

3. Organisational preparedness for
preventing and controlling COVID-19
Limiting transmission of COVID-19 in the healthcare setting requires a range of infection
prevention and control measures which can be considered as a hierarchy of controls.
Administrative controls are implemented at an organisational level (e.g. the design and use of
appropriate processes, systems and engineering controls, and provision and use of suitable
work equipment and materials) to help prevent the introduction of infection and to control and
limit the transmission of infection in healthcare. The control of exposure at source, including
adequate ventilation systems and effective environmental decontamination will physically
reduce exposure to infection. Employers are under a legal obligation – under control of
substances hazardous to health (COSHH) – to adequately control the risk of exposure to
hazardous substances where exposure cannot be prevented. The provision and use of personal
protective equipment (PPE), including respiratory protective equipment (RPE), will protect staff,
patients and visitors. Employees have an obligation to make full and proper use of any control
measures, including PPE, provided by their employer. The principles below are listed as a
hierarchy of infection prevention and control measures at a local hospital/ward level. (Note that
this list is not exhaustive but includes key principles and illustrates a useful approach to
preventing and controlling COVID-19).
Hierarchy of Control measures:
● Early recognition/reporting of cases;
● Early assessment/triaging of cases;
● Implementing control measures, including:
– maintaining separation in space and/or time between suspected and confirmed
COVID-19 patients,
– educating staff, patients and visitors about Standard infection control precautions
(SICPs) and Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs),
– prompt implementation of TBPs to limit transmission,
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 11 of 49
– restricting access of ill visitors to the facility,
– instructing staff members with symptoms to stay at home and not come to work until
symptoms resolve,
– planning and implementation of strategies for surge capacity.
In preparedness for implementing these control measures all healthcare organisations should
undertake planning, and test the preparedness response for the various phases of a pandemic.
This includes:
● An assessment of their facilities’ current capabilities. Healthcare services will not be able
to operate under ‘business as usual’ during a COVID-19 pandemic. An assessment of
the practical ability to deliver care and implement control measures under the pressure
of an exceptional number of patient admissions and reduced staff numbers due to illness
must be assessed; ensuring their facilities’ most current blueprints are readily available
and accessible if needed to make necessary changes;
● An assessment of the current workforce;
● Working in a multidisciplinary team with healthcare and social care leaders/managers,
engineering, and clinical staff to plan for segregation of patients and/or services and
creation of adequate isolation rooms; identifying potential areas that could be converted
effectively with minimum modifications; and
● Defining engineering, administrative, and personnel requirements that can be efficiently
implemented during a pandemic COVID-19 event.8

Page 12 of 49
4. Infection prevention and control
precautions
Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission based precautions (TBPs)
must be used when managing patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
4.1 Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) definition
Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) are the basic infection prevention and control
measures necessary to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious agents from both
recognised and unrecognised sources. Sources include blood and other body fluids, secretions
and excretions (excluding sweat), non-intact skin or mucous membranes, and any equipment or
items in the care environment. SICPs should be used by all staff, in all care settings, at all
times, for all patients.
4.2 Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs) definition
Transmission based precautions (TBPs) are applied when SICPs alone are insufficient to
prevent cross transmission of an infectious agent. TBPs are additional infection control
precautions required when caring for a patient with a known or suspected infectious agent.
TBPs are categorised by the route of transmission of the infectious agent:
4.3 Routes of transmission:
● Contact precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission via direct
contact or indirectly from the immediate care environment (including care equipment).
This is the most common route of infection transmission.
● Droplet precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission over short
distances via droplets (>5μm) from the respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a
mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory
system to above the alveolar level. The maximum distance for cross transmission from
droplets has not been definitively determined, although a distance of approximately
1 metre (3 feet) around the infected individual has frequently been reported in the
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 13 of 49
medical literature as the area of risk.7, 9
● Airborne precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission without
necessarily having close contact via aerosols (≤5μm) from the respiratory tract of one
individual directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Aerosols
penetrate the respiratory system to the alveolar level.
Interrupting transmission of COVID-19 requires both droplet and contact precautions; if an
aerosol generating procedure (AGP) is being undertaken then airborne precautions are
required in addition to contact precautions.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 14 of 49
5. Standard infection control precautions
(SICPs)
5.1 Patient placement/assessment for infection risk
Patients must be promptly assessed for infection risk on arrival at the care area and, if possible,
prior to accepting a patient from another care area. Patients should be continuously reviewed
throughout their inpatient stay. In all healthcare settings, patients with symptoms of COVID-19
should be segregated from non-symptomatic patients as promptly as possible.
5.2 Hand hygiene
Hand hygiene is essential to reduce the transmission of infection in health and other care settings
and is a critical element of standard infection control precautions (SICPs). All staff, patients and
visitors should decontaminate their hands with alcohol based hand rub (ABHR) when entering
and leaving areas where care for –suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients is being
delivered.
Hand hygiene must be performed immediately before every episode of direct patient care and
after any activity or contact that potentially results in hands becoming contaminated, including
the removal of personal protective equipment (PPE), equipment decontamination and waste
handling: https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Your_5_Moments_For_Hand_Hygiene_Poster.pdf
Before performing hand hygiene:
● expose forearms (bare below the elbows);
● remove all hand and wrist jewellery (a single, plain metal finger ring is permitted but
should be removed (or moved up) during hand hygiene);
● ensure finger nails are clean, short and that artificial nails or nail products are not worn;
● cover all cuts or abrasions with a waterproof dressing.
https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Your_5_Moments_For_Hand_Hygiene_Poster.pdf
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 15 of 49
Technique for hand washing and rubbing
● Hand hygiene includes the use of ABHR for routine hand hygiene and hand washing with
soap and water, including thorough drying, if hands are visibly soiled or dirty.
● The technique for hand washing must be carried out thoroughly and for a time period
sufficient to inactivate the virus i.e. 40 to 60 seconds. See Appendix 1 – Best practice
how to hand wash.
● ABHR must be available for all staff as near to point of care as possible, where this is not
practical, personal dispensers should be used. The technique for use of ABHR to
decontaminate hands must be carried out thoroughly and for a time period sufficient to
inactivate the virus i.e. 20 to 30 seconds. See Appendix 2.
● Where no running water is available or hand hygiene facilities are lacking, such as in a
patient’s home, staff may use hand wipes followed by ABHR and should wash their
hands at the first available opportunity.
5.3 Respiratory and cough hygiene – ‘Catch it, bin it, kill it’
Patients, staff and visitors should be encouraged to minimise potential COVID-19 transmission
through good respiratory hygiene measures:
● Disposable, single-use tissues should be used to cover the nose and mouth when
sneezing, coughing or wiping and blowing the nose. Used tissues should be disposed of
promptly in the nearest waste bin.
● Tissues, waste bins (lined and foot operated) and hand hygiene facilities should be
available for patients, visitors and staff.
● Hands should be cleaned (using soap and water if possible, otherwise using ABHR) after
coughing, sneezing, using tissues or after any contact with respiratory secretions and
contaminated objects.
● Encourage patients to keep hands away from the eyes, mouth and nose.
● Some patients (e.g. the elderly and children) may need assistance with containment of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 16 of 49
respiratory secretions; those who are immobile will need a container (e.g. a plastic bag)
readily at hand for immediate disposal of tissues.
● In common waiting areas or during transportation, symptomatic patients may wear a
fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical face mask (FRSM), if tolerated, to minimise the
dispersal of respiratory secretions and reduce environmental contamination.
5.4 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Before undertaking any procedure, staff should assess any likely exposure and ensure PPE is
worn that provides adequate protection against the risks associated with the procedure or task
being undertaken. All staff should be trained in the proper use of all PPE that they may be
required to wear.
In addition:
● Staff who have had and recovered from COVID-19 should continue to follow infection
control precautions, including the PPE recommended in this document.
All PPE should be:
● compliant with the relevant BS/EN standards (European technical standards as adopted
in the UK);
● located close to the point of use;
● stored to prevent contamination in a clean/dry area until required for use (expiry dates
must be adhered to);
● single-use only;
● changed immediately after each patient and/or following completion of a procedure or task;
and
● disposed of after use into the correct waste stream i.e. healthcare/clinical waste (this may
require disposal via orange or yellow bag waste; local guidance will be provided depending
on the impact of the disease)
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 17 of 49
5.4.1 Disposable apron/gown
Disposable plastic aprons must be worn to protect staff uniform or clothes from contamination
when providing direct patient care and during environmental and equipment decontamination.
Fluid-resistant gowns must be worn when a disposable plastic apron provides inadequate cover
of staff uniform or clothes for the procedure/task being performed and when there is a risk of
extensive splashing of blood and/or other body fluids e.g. during aerosol generating procedures
(AGPs). If non fluid-resistant gowns are used, a disposable plastic apron should be worn
underneath.
Disposable aprons and gowns must be changed between patients and immediately after
completion of a procedure/task.
5.4.2 Disposable gloves
Disposable gloves must be worn when providing direct patient care and when exposure to
blood and/or other body fluids is anticipated/likely, including during equipment and
environmental decontamination. Gloves must be changed immediately following the care
episode or the task undertaken.
5.4.3 Eye protection/Face visor
Eye/face protection should be worn when there is a risk of contamination to the eyes from
splashing of secretions (including respiratory secretions), blood, body fluids or excretions. An
individual risk assessment should be carried out prior to/at the time of providing care.
Disposable, single-use, eye/face protection is recommended.
Eye/face protection can be achieved by the use of any one of the following:
● surgical mask with integrated visor;
● full face shield/visor;
● polycarbonate safety spectacles or equivalent;
Regular corrective spectacles are not considered adequate eye protection.
See Appendix 3 for the correct order of donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 18 of 49
5.5 Safe management of linen (laundry)
No special procedures are required; linen is categorised as ‘used’ or ‘infectious’. All linen used
in the direct care of patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 should be managed as
‘infectious’ linen. Linen must be handled, transported and processed in a manner that prevents
exposure to the skin and mucous membranes of staff, contamination of their clothing and the
environment:
Disposable gloves and an apron should be worn when handling infectious linen.
All linen should be handled inside the patient room/cohort area. A laundry receptacle should be
available as close as possible to the point of use for immediate linen deposit.
When handling linen do not:
● rinse, shake or sort linen on removal from beds/trolleys;
● place used/infectious linen on the floor or any other surfaces e.g. a locker/table top;
● re-handle used/infectious linen once bagged;
● overfill laundry receptacles; or
● place inappropriate items in the laundry receptacle e.g. used equipment/needles.
When managing infectious linen:
● place directly into a water-soluble/alginate bag and secure;
● place the water-soluble bag inside a clear polythene bag and secure;
● place the polythene bag into in the appropriately coloured (as per local policy) linen bag
(hamper).
All linen bags/receptacles must be tagged e.g. ward/care area and date. Store all
used/infectious linen in a designated, safe, lockable area whilst awaiting uplift. Organisational
preparedness plans should consider the safe storage of excess linen awaiting collection and for
maintaining supplies of clean linen for patient use.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 19 of 49
5.6 Staff uniforms/clothes
The appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) will protect staff uniform from
contamination in most circumstances. Healthcare facilities should provide changing
rooms/areas where staff can change into uniforms on arrival at work.
Organisations may consider the use of theatre scrubs for staff who do not usually wear a
uniform but who are likely to come into close contact with patients e.g. medical staff.
Healthcare laundry services should be used to launder staff uniforms. If there is no laundry
facility available, then uniforms should be transported home in a disposable plastic bag. This
bag should be disposed of into the household waste stream.
Uniforms should be laundered:
● separately from other household linen;
● in a load not more than half the machine capacity;
● at the maximum temperature the fabric can tolerate, then ironed or tumbled-dried.
NB. It is best practice to change into and out of uniforms at work and not wear them when
travelling; this is based on public perception rather than evidence of an infection risk. This does
not apply to community health workers who are required to travel between patients in the same
uniform.
5.7 Management of blood and body fluid spills
Spillages must be decontaminated in line with local policy. For an example, see Appendix 4.
5.8 Management of healthcare (including clinical) and non-clinical waste
Large volumes of waste may be generated by frequent use of PPE; advice from the local waste
management team should be sought prospectively on how to manage this.
Dispose of all waste as clinical waste.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 20 of 49
Waste from a possible or a confirmed case must be disposed of as Category B waste. The
transport of Category B waste is described in Health Technical Memorandum 07-01: Safe
management of healthcare waste. Disposal of all waste related to possible or confirmed cases
should be classified as infectious clinical waste suitable for alternative treatment, unless the
waste has other properties that would require it to be incinerated.
6. Transmission based precautions (TBPs)
for pandemic COVID-19
In addition to standard infection control precautions (SICPs), droplet precautions should be used
for patients known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19 in all healthcare settings.
● COVID-19 virus is expelled as droplets from the respiratory tract of an infected individual
(e.g. during coughing and sneezing) directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctiva of a
susceptible individual(s) or environmental surface(s).
● Droplets travel only short distances through the air; a distance of at least 1 metre has
been used for deploying droplet precautions.
However, this distance should be
considered as the minimum rather than an absolute:
● Transmission based precautions (TBPs (droplet) should be continued until the resolution
of the patient’s fever and respiratory symptoms.
6.1 Duration of precautions
Patients should remain in isolation/cohort with TBPs applied until the resolution of fever and
respiratory symptoms. The duration of TBPs may require modification based on the intelligence
gathered about COVID-19.
Patients can be discharged before resolution of symptoms provided they are deemed clinically
fit for discharge and should be advised to self-isolate as per staying at home guidance.
Discharge to long term care facilities should be discussed and agreed locally.
The decision to modify the duration of, or ‘stand down’ TBPs should be made by the clinical

Page 21 of 49
team managing the patient(s); based on patient condition and in agreement with the local
Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT).
6.2 Segregation and cohorting (inpatient settings)
6.2.1 Negative pressure isolation rooms
Special environmental controls, such as negative pressure isolation rooms, are not necessary
to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. However, in the early stages, and in high risk
settings, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may be isolated in negative pressure
rooms.
6.2.2 Single rooms
Wherever possible, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed in single
rooms. In an escalating situation there is however likely to be a lack of single rooms/isolation
facilities.
Where single/isolation rooms are in short supply, and cohorting is not yet considered
possible (patient(s) awaiting laboratory confirmation), prioritise patients who have excessive
cough and sputum production for single/isolation room placement.
Single rooms in COVID-19 segregated areas should, wherever possible, be reserved for
performing aerosol generating procedures (AGPs).
Single rooms in non-COVID-19 areas should be reserved for patients requiring isolation for
other (non-influenza-like illness) reasons.
The prioritising of patients for isolation other than suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients
should be decided locally, based on patient need and local resources.
6.2.3 Cohort areas
If a single/isolation room is not available, cohort confirmed respiratory infected patients with
other patients confirmed to have COVID-19. Ensure patients are physically separated; a
distance of at least 1 metre. Use privacy curtains between the beds to minimise opportunities
for close contact. Where possible, a designated self-contained area or wing of the healthcare
facility should be used for the treatment and care of patients with COVID-19. This area should:
● include a reception area that is separate from the rest of the facility and should, if
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 22 of 49
feasible, have a separate entrance/exit from the rest of the building;
● not be used as a thoroughfare by other patients, visitors or staff, including patients being
transferred, staff going for meal breaks, and staff and visitors entering and exiting the
building;
● be separated from non-segregated areas by closed doors; and
● have signage displayed warning of the segregated area to control entry.
Hospitals should consider creating cohort areas which differentiate the level of care required.
It
may also be prudent to consider:
● the need for cohorting in single/mixed sex wards/bays
● underlying patient condition (immunocompromised);
● age groups when cohorting children; and
● routine childhood vaccination status when cohorting children.
6.2.4 Staff cohorting
Assigning a dedicated team of staff to care for patients in isolation/cohort rooms/areas is an
additional infection control measure. This should be implemented whenever there are sufficient
levels of staff available (so as not to have a negative impact on non-affected patients’ care).
Staff who have had confirmed COVID-19 and recovered should continue to follow the infection
control precautions, including personal protective equipment (PPE), as outlined in this
document (see section 7).
6.2.5 Visitors to segregated/cohort areas
Visitors to all areas of the healthcare facility should be restricted to essential visitors only, such
as parents of paediatric patients or an affected patient’s main carer. Local risk assessment and
practical management should be considered, ensuring this is a pragmatic and proportionate
response, including the consideration of whether there is a requirement for visitors to wear PPE
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 23 of 49
or respiratory protective equipment (RPE).
Visiting may be suspended if considered appropriate. All visitors entering a segregated/cohort
area must be instructed on hand hygiene. They must not visit any other care area.
Signage to support restrictions is critical. Visitors with COVID-19 symptoms must not enter the
healthcare facility. Visitors who are symptomatic should be encouraged to leave and must not
be permitted to enter areas where there are immunocompromised patients.
6.3 Patient transfers and transport
6.3.1 Intra-hospital transfers:
● The movement and transport of patients from their single room/cohort area should be
limited to essential purposes only. Staff at the receiving destination must be informed
that the patient has or is suspected to have COVID-19.
● If transport/movement is necessary, consider offering the patient a fluid-resistant (Type
IIR) surgical mask (FRSM) to be worn during transportation, to minimise the dispersal of
respiratory droplets when this can be tolerated.
● Patients must be taken straight to and returned from clinical departments and must not
wait in communal areas. If possible, patients should be placed at the end of clinical lists.
6.3.2 Transfer from primary care/community settings:
● If transfer from a primary care facility or community setting to hospital is required, the
ambulance service should be informed of the infectious status of the patient.
● Staff of the receiving ward/department should be notified in advance of any transfer and
must be informed that the patient has or is suspected to have COVID-19.
6.3.3 Inter-hospital transfers:
● Patient transfer from one healthcare facility to another should be avoided; transfer may
be undertaken if medically necessary for specialist care arising out of complications or
concurrent medical events (for example, cardiac angioplasty, and renal dialysis). If
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 24 of 49
transfer is essential, the ambulance service and receiving hospital must be advised in
advance of the infectious status of the patient.
6.4 Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Personal protective equipment (PPE) for the care of patients with COVID-19 is summarised in
Table 1, see Appendix 3 for how to put on and remove PPE.

6.4.1 Fluid resistant (Type IIR) surgical face masks (FRSM)
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 25 of 49
Fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical masks (FRSMs) are worn to protect the wearer from the
transmission of COVID-19 by respiratory droplets.
In all healthcare settings:
● A FRSM must be worn when working in close contact (within 1 metre) of a patient with
COVID-19 symptoms.
This provides a physical barrier to minimise contamination of the
mucosa of the mouth and nose.
● In an area where pandemic COVID-19 patients have been cohorted together, it may be
more practical for staff to wear a FRSM at all times, rather than only when in close
contact with a patient. Similarly, in primary care/outpatient settings it may be more
practical for staff working in a segregated (COVID-19 patient) area to wear a FRSM for
the duration they are in the patient area.
●
A FRSM for COVID-19 should:
– be well fitted covering both nose and mouth;
– not be allowed to dangle around the neck of the wearer after or between each
use;
– not be touched once put on;
– be changed when they become moist or damaged;
– be removed outside the patient room, cohort area or 1 metre away from the
patient with possible/confirmed COVID-19; and
– be worn once and then discarded as healthcare (clinical) waste (hand
hygiene must always be performed after disposal).
The provision of a FRSM for patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 at point of
assessment or triage in any healthcare setting should be considered if the patient can tolerate it
(except when in a dedicated COVID-19 area).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 26 of 49
6.4.2 Filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirators
Filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirators should be worn whenever there is a risk of
airborne transmission of pandemic COVID-19 i.e. during aerosol generating procedures (AGPs)
and at all times in intensive care unit (ICU), intensive therapy unit (ITU), high dependency unit
(HDU) where COVID-19 patients are cohorted.
All tight fitting respiratory protective equipment (RPE) (i.e. FFP3 respirators) must be:
● single use (disposable) and fluid-resistant*. Fluid resistant FFP3’s should be worn with
appropriate eye protection;
● fit tested on all healthcare staff who may be required to wear an FFP3 respirator to
ensure an adequate seal/fit according to the manufacturers’ guidance; fit checked
(according to the manufacturers’ guidance) every time an FFP3 respirator is donned to
ensure an adequate seal has been achieved;
● compatible with other facial protection used i.e. protective eyewear so that this does not
interfere with the seal of the respiratory protection. Regular corrective spectacles are not
considered adequate eye protection;
● disposed of and replaced if breathing becomes difficult, the respirator is damaged or
distorted, the respirator becomes obviously contaminated by respiratory secretions or
other body fluids, or if a proper face fit cannot be maintained; and
● be worn once and then discarded as healthcare (clinical) waste (hand hygiene
must always be performed after disposal).
*If wearing a FFP3 that is not fluid resistant, a full face shield/ visor must be worn
A FFP3 respirator, although ‘single use’, can be worn for as long as comfortable, for example
for the duration of a ward round or providing clinical care.
Once separated from the face FFP3s must be discarded.
In the absence of an anteroom/lobby remove FFP3 respirators in a safe area (e.g. outside the
isolation/cohort room/area).
All other PPE should be removed in the patient care area.

6.5 Aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs)
Aerosols generated by medical procedures are one route for the transmission of the COVID-19
virus. The following procedures are considered to be potentially infectious AGPs:
● Intubation, extubation and related procedures;
● Tracheotomy/tracheostomy procedures;
● Manual ventilation;
● Open suctioning;
● Bronchoscopy;
● Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) e.g. Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) and
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ventilation (CPAP);
● Surgery and post-mortem procedures in which high-speed devices are used;
● High-frequency oscillating ventilation (HFOV);
● High-flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO)
● Induction of sputum (see glossary);
● Some dental procedures (e.g. high speed drilling).
For patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19, any of these potentially infectious AGPs
should only be carried out when essential. Where possible, these procedures should be carried
out in a single room with the doors shut. Only those healthcare staff who are needed to
undertake the procedure should be present. A disposable, fluid repellant surgical gown, gloves,
eye protection and a FFP3 respirator should be worn by those undertaking the procedure and
those in the room.
Certain other procedures/equipment may generate an aerosol from material other than patient
secretions but are not considered to represent a significant infectious risk. Procedures in this
category include:
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 29 of 49
● administration of pressurised humidified oxygen;
● administration of medication via nebulisation.
Note: During nebulisation, the aerosol derives from a non-patient source (the fluid in the
nebuliser chamber) and does not carry patient-derived viral particles. If a particle in the aerosol
coalesces with a contaminated mucous membrane, it will cease to be airborne and therefore
will not be part of an aerosol. Staff should use appropriate hand hygiene when helping patients
to remove nebulisers and oxygen masks.
6.6 Management of equipment and the care environment
Decontamination of equipment and the care environment must be performed using either:
● A combined detergent/disinfectant solution at a dilution of 1,000 parts per million
available chlorine (ppm available chlorine (av.cl.)); or
● A general purpose neutral detergent in a solution of warm water followed by a
disinfectant solution of 1,000ppm av.cl.
Only cleaning (detergent) and disinfectant products supplied by employers are to be used.
Products must be prepared and used according to the manufacturers’ instructions and
recommended product ""contact times"" must be followed. If alternative cleaning
agents/disinfectants are to be used, they should only on the advice of the IPCT and conform to
EN standard 14476 for virucidal activity
6.6.1 Equipment
Patient care equipment should be single-use items if possible. Reusable (communal) non-
invasive equipment should as far as possible be allocated to the individual patient or cohort of
patients.
Reusable (communal) non-invasive equipment must be decontaminated:
● between each patient and after patient use;
● after blood and body fluid contamination; and
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 30 of 49
● at regular intervals as part of equipment cleaning.
An increased frequency of decontamination should be considered for reusable non-invasive
care equipment when used in isolation/cohort areas.
• ventilators should be protected with a high efficiency filter, such as BS EN 13328-1
• closed system suction should be used
See Appendix 4 for guidance on routine decontamination of reusable non-invasive patient care
equipment.
Avoid the use of fans that re-circulate the air.10
There is no need to use disposable plates or cutlery. Crockery and cutlery can be washed by
hand or in a dishwasher using household detergent and hand-hot water after use.
6.6.2 Environment
Patient isolations rooms, cohort areas and clinical rooms must be decontaminated at least
daily. Clinical rooms should also be decontaminated after clinical sessions for patients with
suspected/known pandemic COVID-19. In addition, patient isolation rooms must be terminally
cleaned:
● Following resolution of symptoms, discharge or transfer (this includes removal and
laundering of all curtains and bed screens);
● Once vacated by staff following an AGP. Clearance of infectious particles after an AGP
is dependent on the mechanical/natural ventilation and air change per hour(ACH) within
the room. A single air change is estimated to remove 63% of airborne contaminants;
after 5 air changes, less than 1% of airborne contamination is thought to remain.
In an
isolation room with 10-12 ACH a minimum of 20 minutes is considered pragmatic; in a
side room with 6 ACH this would be approximately 1 hour. Advice should be sought from
the local Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT).
An increased frequency of decontamination should be incorporated into the environmental
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 31 of 49
decontamination schedules for areas where there may be higher environmental contamination
rates e.g.
● toilets/commodes particularly if patients have diarrhoea; and
● “frequently touched” surfaces such as medical equipment, door/toilet handles and locker
tops, patient call bells, over bed tables and bed rails should be cleaned at least twice
daily and when known to be contaminated with secretions, excretions or body fluids.
Domestic/cleaning staff performing environmental decontamination should:
● be allocated to specific area(s) and not be moved between COVID-19 and non-COVID-
19 care areas;
● be trained in which personal protective equipment (PPE) to use and the correct methods
of wearing, removing and disposing of PPE. The care environment should be kept clean
and clutter free. All non-essential items including toys, books and magazines should be
removed from reception and waiting areas, consulting and treatment rooms, emergency
departments, day rooms and lounges.
When made available, these items should not be
shared. All toys must be cleanable and should be cleaned regularly (preferably at the
same time as the environment).
6.7 Handling dead bodies
The principles of Standard Infection Control Precautions (SICPs) and Transmission Based
Precautions (TBPs) continue to apply whilst deceased individuals remain in the care
environment. This is due to the ongoing risk of infectious transmission via contact although the
risk is usually lower than for living patients. Where the deceased was known or suspected to
have been infected with COVID-19, there is no requirement for a body bag, and viewing,
hygienic preparations, post-mortem and embalming are all permitted.
Following a risk assessment of the potential post-mortem risk pathways PHE has developed
this advice in line with the principles set out in the HSE guidance for droplet transmission risk
as set out in: ‘Managing infection risks when handling the deceased: Guidance for the
mortuary, post-mortem room and funeral premises, and during exhumation’.

Page 32 of 49
7. Occupational health and staff
deployment
Prompt recognition of cases of COVID-19 among healthcare staff is essential to limit the
spread. Healthcare staff with influenza-like illness should not come to work. As a general
principle, healthcare staff who provide care in areas for suspected/confirmed patients should not
care for other patients, although exceptions may be necessary.
A risk assessment is required for health and social care staff at high risk of complications from
COVID-19, including pregnant staff. Employers should:
● Discuss with employees who are at risk or are pregnant the need to be deployed away from
areas used for the care of those who have, or are clinically suspected of having, COVID-19;
or, in the primary care setting, from clinics set up to manage people with COVID-19
symptoms.
● Ensure that advice is available to all healthcare staff, including specific advice to those at
risk from complications.
Bank, agency and locum staff should follow the same deployment advice as permanent staff.
As part of their employer’s duty of care, providers have a role to play in ensuring that a fit
testing programme is in place for those who may need to wear filtering face piece (class 3)
(FFP3) respirator. In the event of a breach in infection control procedures e.g. an incorrectly worn
FFP3 respirator during a potentially infectious aerosol generating procedure (AGP, staff should
be reviewed by occupational health.
Occupational health departments should lead on the implementation of systems to monitor staff
illness and absence.
Where possible, staff who have had confirmed COVID-19 (early in the stages of the outbreak
this would be via virology confirmation, thereafter, this is likely to be as per case definition)
should work in the cohort areas and care for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients. Such
staff should continue to follow the infection control precautions, including personal protective
equipment (PPE), as outlined in this document.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 33 of 49
8. Specific settings
The following guidance is given to assist specific care settings to implement the principles of
standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission based precautions (TBPs)
described in this document, which apply in all care settings.
8.1 Care home settings
Isolation within a care home for a known/suspected infection can be achieved in the persons’
bedroom in most cases. Residents should remain in their bedroom whilst considered infectious
(as described above) and the door should remain closed (if unable to isolate the individual then
this should be documented).
8.2 Primary care
In primary care settings (e.g. General Practitioner (GP) practices) suspected COVID-19
patients should be segregated in place or time from other patients, this may be achieved by:
● Creating a separate area within the facility for care of suspected patients, including
separate waiting and reception areas if possible. The area should be separated from
non-segregated areas by closed doors. To control entry, signage should be displayed
warning of the segregated area.
● Alternatively, suspected patients should be seen at a different time from other patients,
with disinfection of shared areas taking place between different clinics.
● GP practices may make arrangements for distinct COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 clinics.
(Non-essential GP clinics may need to be cancelled to enable this).
● Primary care staff should, wherever possible be allocated to either COVID-19
or
other patients.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 34 of 49
8.3 Outpatient settings
For patients who develop symptoms and have long term health conditions that require
attendance at outpatient settings e.g. hospital day care, options include:
● deferring the procedure and re-scheduling the next appointment;
● transferring the patient to a designated hospital with isolation or cohort facilities;
● introducing physical barriers such as screens in special units to separate patients with
symptoms of COVID-19.
8.4 Dental surgeries
Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 should not be seen for routine dental care. If a dental
emergency is suspected such as severe haemorrhaging or difficulty in breathing the patient
should be seen in a hospital environment.
If emergency dental care is required staff in attendance should be kept to a minimum and must
wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (see table 1) particularly if this involves
high speed drilling section 6.5.
8.5 Home visits
Home visits should continue as long as required to patients without COVID-19. If it becomes
necessary to suspend some home visits, alternative arrangements must be put in place to
maintain contact (e.g. telephone liaison). Health and social care staff performing non-deferrable
essential visits (for example, child protection) to households with suspected/confirmed COVID-
19, should follow the infection control precautions in this document.
8.6 Ambulances
In ambulances, patient segregation can be achieved by:
● designating an ambulance(s) for transfer of patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19
for the duration of each shift;
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 35 of 49
● transporting coughing and sneezing patients on their own whenever possible. However, if
pressure upon the service occurs, two patients with symptoms of COVID-19 may be
transferred together and should wear a fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask (FRSM).
Depending on the stage of the pandemic and an assessment of risk, ambulance staff may be
required to wear respiratory protective equipment (RPE). This will be determined locally.
8.7 Emergency departments and acute assessment units
Emergency departments and acute assessment units may be overwhelmed with patients
seeking care during the peak of a pandemic. Alternative approaches to triage and initial
assessment will be required to:
● rapidly screen and identify those who have symptoms of COVID-19 upon their arrival;
● separate symptomatic patients from others to reduce the risk of transmission; and
● determine as early as possible the type of care patients will require (i.e. see and
discharge or admit for treatment).
8.7.1 Screening and triage
Signage should be displayed prior to and on entry to assessment units instructing patients with
symptoms to inform reception staff immediately on their arrival.
A triage practitioner(s) should be based in the reception to manage patient flow, including
deferral of patients who do not require emergency care.
8.7.2 Reception area
Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 should be triaged to a segregated waiting and
assessment area immediately. Patients should be instructed to stay in this waiting area and not
visit other departments or, parts of the hospital/unit, or go to public areas such as the cafeteria.
Signage and physical barriers should be used as appropriate.
If separate areas for patients with symptoms of COVID-19 cannot be established, an alternative
area/site should be set up for those at highest risk of complications from COVID-19 and who do
not have respiratory symptoms (e.g. patients presenting for dialysis, patients with a history of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 36 of 49
blood cell or organ transplantation, chemotherapy, or who are immunocompromised for other
reasons).
Patients who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 but require prompt acute care assessment
should be triaged to a specific waiting and examination area, physically separate from the
COVID-19 waiting and assessment area.
8.7.3Critical care
PPE must be worn:
• all respiratory equipment must be protected with a high efficiency filter (such as BS EN 13328-
1). This filter must be disposed of after use
• disposable respiratory equipment should be used wherever possible. Re-usable equipment
must, as a minimum, be decontaminated in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
• a closed suctioning system must be used
• ventilator circuits should not be broken unless necessary
• ventilators must be placed on standby when carrying out bagging
8.7.4 Theatres
• theatres must be informed in advance of a patient transfer of a confirmed or possible COVID-
19 positive case
• the patient should be transported directly to the operating theatre and should wear a surgical
mask if it can be tolerated
• the patient should be anaesthetised and recovered in the theatre. Staff should wear protective
clothing but only those at risk of exposure from aerosol generating procedures, i.e during
intubation need to wear FFP3 respirators and full gowns. considerations about the use of
respiratory/anaesthetic equipment are addressed in the critical care section above
• instruments and devices should be decontaminated in the normal manner in accordance with
manufacturers’ advice
• both laryngoscope handle and blade should either be single use or reprocessed in the Sterile
Supply Department. Video laryngoscope blades should be single use and scope/handle
decontaminated as per manufacture instructions.
• the theatre should be cleaned as per local policy for infected cases, paying particular attention
to hand contact points on the anaesthetic machine
• theatres should not be used by staff or patients for 20 minutes after the patient leaves if
conventionally ventilated, or 5 minutes if ultraclean ventilation is used
• possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19 should be placed at the end of the list where feasible

Appendix 7 Glossary
Aerosol-generating procedures
(AGPs)
Certain medical and patient care activities that
can result in the release of airborne particles
(aerosols). AGPs can create a risk of airborne
transmission of infections that are usually only
spread by droplet transmission.
Airborne Transmission
The spread of infection from one person to
another by airborne particles (aerosols)
containing infectious agents.
Airborne particles
Very small particles that may contain
infectious agents. They can remain in the air for
long periods of time and can be carried over
long distances by air currents. Airborne particles
can be released when a person coughs
or sneezes, and during aerosol generating
procedures (AGPs). “Droplet nuclei” are
aerosols formed from the evaporation of larger
droplet particles (see Droplet Transmission).
Aerosols formed from droplet particles in this
way behave as other aerosols.
Airborne precautions Measures used to prevent and control infections
spread without necessarily having close patient
contact via aerosols (less than or equal to 5μm)
from the respiratory tract of one individual
directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae
of another individual. Aerosols can penetrate the
respiratory system to the alveolar level.
BS/EN standards
Mandatory technical specifications created by
either the British Standards Institute (BS) or
European Standardisation Organisations (EN) in
collaboration with government bodies, industry
experts and trade associations. They aim to
ensure the quality and safety of products,
services and systems.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 44 of 49
Cohort area
An area (room, bay, ward) in which two or more
patients (a cohort) with the same confirmed
infection are placed. A cohort area should be
physically separate from other patients.
Contact precautions
Measures used to prevent and control infections
that spread via direct contact with the patient or
indirectly from the patient’s immediate care
environment (including care equipment). This is
the most common route of infection
transmission.
Contact transmission Contact transmission is the most common route
of transmission, and consists of two distinct
types: direct contact and indirect contact. Direct
transmission occurs when microorganisms are
transmitted directly from an infectious individual
to another individual without the involvement of
another contaminated person or object (fomite).
Indirect transmission occurs when
microorganisms are transmitted from an
infectious individual to another individual through
a contaminated object or person (fomite) or
person.
COVID-19 COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory
disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The
disease was discovered in China in December
2019 and has since spread around the world.
Droplet precautions
Measures used to prevent and control infections
spread over short distances (at least 1 metre (3
feet) via droplets (greater than 5μm) from the
respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a
mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another
individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory
system to above the alveolar level.
Droplet transmission
The spread of infection from one person to
another by droplets containing infectious agents.
Eye/Face protection
Worn when there is a risk from splashing of
secretion (including respiratory secretions),
eye/face protection can be achieved by the use
of any one of the following: a surgical mask with
integrated visor; a full face visor/shield; or
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 45 of 49
polycarbonate safety spectacles or equivalent;
FFP3 Respiratory protection that is worn over the nose
and mouth designed to protect the wearer from
inhaling hazardous substances, including
airborne particles (aerosols). FFP stands for
filtering face piece. There are three categories of
FFP respirator: FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3. An FFP3
respirator provides the highest level of
protection, and is the only category of respirator
legislated for use in UK healthcare settings.
Fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical face
mask (FRSM)
A disposable fluid-resistant mask worn over the
nose and mouth to protect the mucous
membranes of the wearer’s nose and mouth
from splashes and infectious droplets. FRSMs
can also be used to protect patients.
When
recommended for infection control purposes a
'surgical face mask' typically denotes a
fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask.
Fluid-resistant
A term applied to fabrics that resist liquid
penetration, often used interchangeably with
'fluid-repellent' when describing the properties of
protective clothing or equipment.
Frequently touched surfaces
Surfaces of the environment which are
commonly touched/come into contact with
human hands.
High Consequence Infectious Disease
(HCID)
In the UK, a high consequence infectious disease
(HCID) is defined according to the following
criteria: Acute infectious disease; typically has a
high case-fatality rate; may not have effective
prophylaxis or treatment; often difficult to
recognise and detect rapidly; ability to spread in
the community and within healthcare settings; and
requires an enhanced individual, population and
system response to ensure it is managed
effectively, efficiently and safely.
Healthcare/clinical waste Waste produced as a result of healthcare
activities for example soiled dressings, sharps.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 46 of 49
High risk units
Intensive care units, intensive therapy units and
high dependency units.
Incubation period
The period between the infection of an individual
by a pathogen and the manifestation of the illness
or disease it causes.
Induction of sputum Induction of sputum typically involves the
administration of nebulised saline to moisten and
loosen respiratory secretions (this may be
accompanied by chest physiotherapy (percussion
and vibration)) to induce forceful coughing.
Infectious linen
Linen that has been used by a patient who is
known or suspected to be infectious and/or linen
that is contaminated with blood and/or other body
fluids e.g. faeces.
Long term health condition
Defined as:
• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
bronchitis, emphysema or asthma
• Heart disease
• Kidney disease
• Liver disease
• Stroke or a transient ischaemic attack (TIA)
• Diabetes
• Lowered immunity as a result of disease or
medical treatment, such as steroid
medication or cancer treatment
• Neurological condition, such as
Parkinson's disease, motor neurone
disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), cerebral
palsy, or a learning disability
• Problem with spleen, including sickle cell
disease, or had spleen removed
• A BMI of 40 or above (obese).
Negative pressure isolation room
A room which maintains permanent negative
pressure i.e. air flow is from the outside adjacent
space (e.g. corridor) into the room and then
exhausted to the outdoors.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 47 of 49
New and emerging viruses (including
respiratory viruses)
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) defines emerging infectious diseases as:
• New infections resulting from changes in or
evolution of existing organisms.
• Known infections spreading to new
geographical areas or populations.
• Previously unrecognised infections
appearing in areas undergoing ecological
transformation.
• Old infections re-emerging as a result of
antibiotic resistance in known agents or
breakdown in public health measures.
Personal Protective Equipment
(PPE)
Equipment a person wears to protect themselves
from risks to their health or safety, including
exposure to infection agents. The level of PPE
required depends on: Suspected/known infectious
agent; severity of the illness caused; transmission
route of the infectious agent; and the
procedure/task being undertaken.
Respiratory droplets
A small droplet, such as a particle of moisture
released from the mouth during coughing,
sneezing, or speaking.
Respiratory symptoms ‘Respiratory symptoms’ include rhinorrhoea
(runny nose); sore throat; cough; difficulty
breathing or shortness of breath.
Segregation
Physically separating or isolating from other
people.
SARS-CoV Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,
the virus responsible for the 2003 outbreak of
human coronavirus disease.
SARS-CoV-2 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,
the virus responsible for the 2019 outbreak of
COVID-19 disease.
Standard infection control
precautions (SICPs)
SICPs are the basic infection prevention and
control measures necessary to reduce the risk of
transmission of an infectious agent from both
recognised and unrecognised sources of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.

infection.
Single room
A room with space for one patient and usually
contains as a minimum: a bed; locker/wardrobe;
and a clinical wash-hand basin.
Staff cohorting
When staff care for one specific group of patients
and do not move between different patient
cohorts. Patient cohorts may include for example
‘symptomatic’, ‘asymptomatic and exposed’, or
‘asymptomatic and unexposed’ patient groups.
Transmission based precautions
Additional precautions to be used in addition to
SICPs when caring for patients with a known or
suspected infection or colonisation.

Supporting allied health professionals and allied health professional support
workers during the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK
As we enter unprecedented times in the NHS and wider health and social care services, we
wanted to write to you firstly to thank you for the exceptionally hard work you and your staff
are doing and secondly to offer you our support.
The World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic, and
the Prime Minister has declared that the UK is moving into the delay phase of fighting the
virus, which will put the NHS and wider health and care services of all four nations under
extreme pressure. This pressure will inevitably be exacerbated by staff shortages due to
sickness or caring responsibilities. It will be a challenge, but we are confident that allied
health professionals (AHPs) and their support workforce will respond rapidly and
professionally. We want to assure colleagues that we recognise this will require temporary
changes to practice and that regulators and others will take this into account.
A significant epidemic will require healthcare professionals to be flexible in what they do. It
may entail working in unfamiliar circumstances or surroundings or working in clinical areas
outside their usual practice for the benefit of patients, individuals and the population as a
whole. This can be stressful, and we recognise that you may have concerns about both the
professional practicalities and implications of working in such circumstances.
We need to keep to the basic principles of AHP best practice. As registered AHPs, you are
expected to follow Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) and General Osteopathic
Council (GOsC) guidance and use judgement in applying the principles to situations that you
may face. However, these also take account of the realities of a very abnormal emergency
situation. We want AHPs, in partnership with patients and individuals we care for, to use
their professional judgement to assess risk and to make sure people receive safe care,
informed by the values and principles in our professional standards of conduct, performance
and ethics. A rational approach to varying practice in an emergency is part of that
professional response.
It is the responsibility of the organisations in which you work to ensure you are supported to
do this. They must bear in mind that clinicians may need to depart, possibly significantly,
from established procedures to care for people in the unique and highly challenging but time-
bound circumstances of the peak of an epidemic.
We expect employers, educationalists, professional bodies and national NHS organisations
to be flexible in terms of their approach and the expectations of routine requirements.
Healthcare professional regulators, including the HCPC and GOsC have already committed
to take into account factors relevant to the environment in which the professional is working.
Due consideration should and will be given to AHPs and other staff who are using their skills
under difficult circumstances due to lack of personnel and overwhelming demand in a major
epidemic. This may include working outside an individual's scope of practice. The healthcare
regulators have already released a joint statement to explain this:

and https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/news/joint-statement-
covid-19-coronavirus/
We are also determined to ensure the long-term education of students is not compromised.
This will be given appropriate consideration by all the relevant bodies.
Finally, we would like to thank you all for the efforts you are already making. Many AHPs and
their support staff across the NHS and public health services have made major contributions
to the response to COVID-19. We are very proud of the response of the professions in all
areas of practice in their response to this challenge. It has been exemplary. We are
confident of the commitment, dedication, professionalism and hard work that the AHP
workforce has and will continue to have over the course of this significant pandemic.
Yours sincerely

(b) have due regard to any guidance issued by Public Health England; and
(c) where consultation has not been carried out under sub-paragraph (a)—
(i) consult a registered public health consultant as soon as reasonably practicable after

end of the initial period.
Offences

1. Introduction
This document outlines the infection prevention and control advice for healthcare workers
involved in receiving, assessing and caring for patients who are a possible or confirmed case of
COVID-19.
It is based on the best evidence available from previous pandemic and inter-
pandemic periods and focuses on the infection prevention and control aspects of this disease
only, recognising that a preparedness plan will consider other counter measures.
The infection prevention and control advice in this document is considered good practice in
response to this COVID-19 pandemic.
N.B. The emerging evidence base on COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. Further updates may
be made to this guidance as new detail or evidence emerges.
1.1 Scope and purpose
This document provides guidance and information on infection prevention and control
procedures to inform and advise local healthcare planning for COVID-19. This guidance has
been written for the NHS, but the infection prevention and control principles apply to other
settings where healthcare is delivered. It is issued jointly by the Department of Health and
Social Care (DHSC), Public Health Wales (PHW), Public Health Agency (PHA) Northern
Ireland, Health Protection Scotland (HPS) and Public Health England as official guidance.
Whilst this guidance seeks to ensure a consistent and resilient UK wide approach, some
differences in operational details and organisational responsibilities may apply in Northern
Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland.

2. Transmission characteristics of COVID-
19 and principles of infection prevention
and control
2.1 Routes of transmission
Infection control advice is based on the reasonable assumption that the transmission
characteristics of COVID-19 are similar to those of the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak. The initial
phylogenetic and immunologic similarities between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV can be
extrapolated to gain insight into some of the epidemiological characteristics. The transmission
of COVID-19 is thought to occur mainly through respiratory droplets generated by coughing and
sneezing, and through contact with contaminated surfaces.1
The predominant modes of
transmission are assumed to be droplet and contact.
For SARS-CoV, there is limited evidence
from observational studies showing a protective effect of up to 80% of masks and N95
respirators (the US equivalent of UK FFP2 respirators) used by healthcare workers however the
evidence base is sparse and indications (and compliance) for mask/respirator use in these
studies varied.2 It should be noted that N95 respirators are not recommended for use in UK
healthcare settings. In the UK, FFP3 respirators should be worn for airborne precautions and
must be compliant with BS EN149:200.1 For SARS-CoV, evidence suggests that use of both
respirators and surgical face masks offer a similar level of protection, both associated with up to
an 80% reduction in risk of infection.2 During AGPs there is an increased risk of aerosol spread
of infectious agents irrespective of the mode of transmission (contact, droplet, or airborne)
(Section 6.5 AGPs), and airborne precautions must be implemented when performing AGPs,
including those carried out on a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.
In light of the above, the Department of Health and Social Care’s New and Emerging
Respiratory Virus Threat Assessment Group (NERVTAG) have recommended that airborne
precautions should be implemented at all times in clinical areas considered AGP ‘hot spots’ e.g.
Intensive Care Units (ICU), Intensive Therapy Units (ITU) or High Dependency Units (HDU) that
are managing COVID-19 patients (unless patients are isolated in a negative pressure isolation
room/or single room, where only staff entering the room need wear a respirator).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 8 of 49
In other areas a fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask (FRSM) is recommended; all general
ward staff, community, ambulance and social care staff should wear an FRSM for close patient
contact (within 1 metre), unless performing an AGP, when a filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3)
respirator, eye protection, a disposable long sleeved gown and gloves should be worn.
Initial research has identified the presence of live COVID-19 virus in the stools and conjunctival
secretions of confirmed cases.1
All secretions (except sweat) and excretions, including
diarrhoeal stools from patients with known or suspected COVID-19, should be regarded as
potentially infectious.
2.2 Incubation and infectious period
Assessment of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 cases suggests
that, similar to SARS-CoV, patients will not be infectious until the onset of symptoms.
In most
cases, individuals are usually considered infectious while they have symptoms; how infectious
individuals are, depends on the severity of their symptoms and stage of their illness. The median
time from symptom onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately 2 weeks and is 3-6
weeks for severe or critical cases.3
There have been case reports that suggest infectivity
during the asymptomatic period, with one patient found to be shedding virus before the onset of
symptoms.4
Further study is required to determine the actual occurrence and impact of
asymptomatic transmission.
Precautions in section 5: Standard Infection Control Precautions (SICPs) and section 6:
Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs) should remain in place until symptoms resolve.
From international data, the balance of evidence is that infectivity has significantly reduced 7
days after the onset of symptoms.
2.3 Survival in the environment
In light of limited data for SARS-CoV-2, evidence was assessed from studies conducted with
previous human coronaviruses including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Human coronaviruses
can survive on inanimate objects and can remain viable for up to 5 days at temperatures of 22-
25°C and relative humidity of 40-50% (which is typical of air-conditioned indoor environments).1
Survival on environmental surfaces is also dependent on the surface type.1
An experimental
study using a SARS-CoV-2 strain reported viability on plastic for up to 72 hours, for 48 hours on
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 9 of 49
stainless steel and up to 8 hours on copper.1 Viability was quantified by end-point titration on
Vero E6 cells. Extensive environmental contamination may occur following an aerosol
generating procedure (AGP). The rate of clearance of aerosols in an enclosed space is
dependent on the extent of any mechanical/natural ventilation – the greater the number of air
changes per hour (ventilation rate), the sooner any aerosol will be cleared.5 The time required
for clearance of aerosols, and thus the time after which the room can be entered without a
filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirator, can be determined by the number of air changes
per hour (ACH) as outlined in WHO guidance; in general wards and single rooms there should
be a minimum of 6 air changes per hour, in negative-pressure isolation rooms there should be
a minimum of 12 air changes per hour.6 Where feasible, environmental
decontamination
should be performed when it is considered appropriate to enter the room/area without an FFP3
respirator. A single air change is estimated to remove 63% of airborne contaminants, after 5 air
changes less than 1% of airborne contamination is thought to remain.7 A minimum of 20
minutes i.e. 2 air changes, in hospital settings where the majority of these procedures occur is
considered pragmatic.
The precautions described in section 5.2: Hand hygiene and section 6.6: Management of
patient care environment and equipment should be followed.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 10 of 49
3. Organisational preparedness for
preventing and controlling COVID-19
Limiting transmission of COVID-19 in the healthcare setting requires a range of infection
prevention and control measures which can be considered as a hierarchy of controls.
Administrative controls are implemented at an organisational level (e.g. the design and use of
appropriate processes, systems and engineering controls, and provision and use of suitable
work equipment and materials) to help prevent the introduction of infection and to control and
limit the transmission of infection in healthcare. The control of exposure at source, including
adequate ventilation systems and effective environmental decontamination will physically
reduce exposure to infection. Employers are under a legal obligation – under control of
substances hazardous to health (COSHH) – to adequately control the risk of exposure to
hazardous substances where exposure cannot be prevented. The provision and use of personal
protective equipment (PPE), including respiratory protective equipment (RPE), will protect staff,
patients and visitors. Employees have an obligation to make full and proper use of any control
measures, including PPE, provided by their employer. The principles below are listed as a
hierarchy of infection prevention and control measures at a local hospital/ward level. (Note that
this list is not exhaustive but includes key principles and illustrates a useful approach to
preventing and controlling COVID-19).
Hierarchy of Control measures:
● Early recognition/reporting of cases;
● Early assessment/triaging of cases;
● Implementing control measures, including:
– maintaining separation in space and/or time between suspected and confirmed
COVID-19 patients,
– educating staff, patients and visitors about Standard infection control precautions
(SICPs) and Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs),
– prompt implementation of TBPs to limit transmission,
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 11 of 49
– restricting access of ill visitors to the facility,
– instructing staff members with symptoms to stay at home and not come to work until
symptoms resolve,
– planning and implementation of strategies for surge capacity.
In preparedness for implementing these control measures all healthcare organisations should
undertake planning, and test the preparedness response for the various phases of a pandemic.
This includes:
● An assessment of their facilities’ current capabilities. Healthcare services will not be able
to operate under ‘business as usual’ during a COVID-19 pandemic. An assessment of
the practical ability to deliver care and implement control measures under the pressure
of an exceptional number of patient admissions and reduced staff numbers due to illness
must be assessed; ensuring their facilities’ most current blueprints are readily available
and accessible if needed to make necessary changes;
● An assessment of the current workforce;
● Working in a multidisciplinary team with healthcare and social care leaders/managers,
engineering, and clinical staff to plan for segregation of patients and/or services and
creation of adequate isolation rooms; identifying potential areas that could be converted
effectively with minimum modifications; and
● Defining engineering, administrative, and personnel requirements that can be efficiently
implemented during a pandemic COVID-19 event.8

Page 12 of 49
4. Infection prevention and control
precautions
Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission based precautions (TBPs)
must be used when managing patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
4.1 Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) definition
Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) are the basic infection prevention and control
measures necessary to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious agents from both
recognised and unrecognised sources. Sources include blood and other body fluids, secretions
and excretions (excluding sweat), non-intact skin or mucous membranes, and any equipment or
items in the care environment. SICPs should be used by all staff, in all care settings, at all
times, for all patients.
4.2 Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs) definition
Transmission based precautions (TBPs) are applied when SICPs alone are insufficient to
prevent cross transmission of an infectious agent. TBPs are additional infection control
precautions required when caring for a patient with a known or suspected infectious agent.
TBPs are categorised by the route of transmission of the infectious agent:
4.3 Routes of transmission:
● Contact precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission via direct
contact or indirectly from the immediate care environment (including care equipment).
This is the most common route of infection transmission.
● Droplet precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission over short
distances via droplets (>5μm) from the respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a
mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory
system to above the alveolar level. The maximum distance for cross transmission from
droplets has not been definitively determined, although a distance of approximately
1 metre (3 feet) around the infected individual has frequently been reported in the
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 13 of 49
medical literature as the area of risk.7, 9
● Airborne precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission without
necessarily having close contact via aerosols (≤5μm) from the respiratory tract of one
individual directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Aerosols
penetrate the respiratory system to the alveolar level.
Interrupting transmission of COVID-19 requires both droplet and contact precautions; if an
aerosol generating procedure (AGP) is being undertaken then airborne precautions are
required in addition to contact precautions.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 14 of 49
5. Standard infection control precautions
(SICPs)
5.1 Patient placement/assessment for infection risk
Patients must be promptly assessed for infection risk on arrival at the care area and, if possible,
prior to accepting a patient from another care area. Patients should be continuously reviewed
throughout their inpatient stay. In all healthcare settings, patients with symptoms of COVID-19
should be segregated from non-symptomatic patients as promptly as possible.
5.2 Hand hygiene
Hand hygiene is essential to reduce the transmission of infection in health and other care settings
and is a critical element of standard infection control precautions (SICPs). All staff, patients and
visitors should decontaminate their hands with alcohol based hand rub (ABHR) when entering
and leaving areas where care for –suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients is being
delivered.
Hand hygiene must be performed immediately before every episode of direct patient care and
after any activity or contact that potentially results in hands becoming contaminated, including
the removal of personal protective equipment (PPE), equipment decontamination and waste
handling: https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Your_5_Moments_For_Hand_Hygiene_Poster.pdf
Before performing hand hygiene:
● expose forearms (bare below the elbows);
● remove all hand and wrist jewellery (a single, plain metal finger ring is permitted but
should be removed (or moved up) during hand hygiene);
● ensure finger nails are clean, short and that artificial nails or nail products are not worn;
● cover all cuts or abrasions with a waterproof dressing.
https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Your_5_Moments_For_Hand_Hygiene_Poster.pdf
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 15 of 49
Technique for hand washing and rubbing
● Hand hygiene includes the use of ABHR for routine hand hygiene and hand washing with
soap and water, including thorough drying, if hands are visibly soiled or dirty.
● The technique for hand washing must be carried out thoroughly and for a time period
sufficient to inactivate the virus i.e. 40 to 60 seconds. See Appendix 1 – Best practice
how to hand wash.
● ABHR must be available for all staff as near to point of care as possible, where this is not
practical, personal dispensers should be used. The technique for use of ABHR to
decontaminate hands must be carried out thoroughly and for a time period sufficient to
inactivate the virus i.e. 20 to 30 seconds. See Appendix 2.
● Where no running water is available or hand hygiene facilities are lacking, such as in a
patient’s home, staff may use hand wipes followed by ABHR and should wash their
hands at the first available opportunity.
5.3 Respiratory and cough hygiene – ‘Catch it, bin it, kill it’
Patients, staff and visitors should be encouraged to minimise potential COVID-19 transmission
through good respiratory hygiene measures:
● Disposable, single-use tissues should be used to cover the nose and mouth when
sneezing, coughing or wiping and blowing the nose. Used tissues should be disposed of
promptly in the nearest waste bin.
● Tissues, waste bins (lined and foot operated) and hand hygiene facilities should be
available for patients, visitors and staff.
● Hands should be cleaned (using soap and water if possible, otherwise using ABHR) after
coughing, sneezing, using tissues or after any contact with respiratory secretions and
contaminated objects.
● Encourage patients to keep hands away from the eyes, mouth and nose.
● Some patients (e.g. the elderly and children) may need assistance with containment of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 16 of 49
respiratory secretions; those who are immobile will need a container (e.g. a plastic bag)
readily at hand for immediate disposal of tissues.
● In common waiting areas or during transportation, symptomatic patients may wear a
fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical face mask (FRSM), if tolerated, to minimise the
dispersal of respiratory secretions and reduce environmental contamination.
5.4 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Before undertaking any procedure, staff should assess any likely exposure and ensure PPE is
worn that provides adequate protection against the risks associated with the procedure or task
being undertaken. All staff should be trained in the proper use of all PPE that they may be
required to wear.
In addition:
● Staff who have had and recovered from COVID-19 should continue to follow infection
control precautions, including the PPE recommended in this document.
All PPE should be:
● compliant with the relevant BS/EN standards (European technical standards as adopted
in the UK);
● located close to the point of use;
● stored to prevent contamination in a clean/dry area until required for use (expiry dates
must be adhered to);
● single-use only;
● changed immediately after each patient and/or following completion of a procedure or task;
and
● disposed of after use into the correct waste stream i.e. healthcare/clinical waste (this may
require disposal via orange or yellow bag waste; local guidance will be provided depending
on the impact of the disease)
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 17 of 49
5.4.1 Disposable apron/gown
Disposable plastic aprons must be worn to protect staff uniform or clothes from contamination
when providing direct patient care and during environmental and equipment decontamination.
Fluid-resistant gowns must be worn when a disposable plastic apron provides inadequate cover
of staff uniform or clothes for the procedure/task being performed and when there is a risk of
extensive splashing of blood and/or other body fluids e.g. during aerosol generating procedures
(AGPs). If non fluid-resistant gowns are used, a disposable plastic apron should be worn
underneath.
Disposable aprons and gowns must be changed between patients and immediately after
completion of a procedure/task.
5.4.2 Disposable gloves
Disposable gloves must be worn when providing direct patient care and when exposure to
blood and/or other body fluids is anticipated/likely, including during equipment and
environmental decontamination. Gloves must be changed immediately following the care
episode or the task undertaken.
5.4.3 Eye protection/Face visor
Eye/face protection should be worn when there is a risk of contamination to the eyes from
splashing of secretions (including respiratory secretions), blood, body fluids or excretions. An
individual risk assessment should be carried out prior to/at the time of providing care.
Disposable, single-use, eye/face protection is recommended.
Eye/face protection can be achieved by the use of any one of the following:
● surgical mask with integrated visor;
● full face shield/visor;
● polycarbonate safety spectacles or equivalent;
Regular corrective spectacles are not considered adequate eye protection.
See Appendix 3 for the correct order of donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE).

No special procedures are required; linen is categorised as ‘used’ or ‘infectious’. All linen used
in the direct care of patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 should be managed as
‘infectious’ linen. Linen must be handled, transported and processed in a manner that prevents
exposure to the skin and mucous membranes of staff, contamination of their clothing and the
environment:
Disposable gloves and an apron should be worn when handling infectious linen.
All linen should be handled inside the patient room/cohort area. A laundry receptacle should be
available as close as possible to the point of use for immediate linen deposit.
When handling linen do not:
● rinse, shake or sort linen on removal from beds/trolleys;
● place used/infectious linen on the floor or any other surfaces e.g. a locker/table top;
● re-handle used/infectious linen once bagged;
● overfill laundry receptacles; or
● place inappropriate items in the laundry receptacle e.g. used equipment/needles.
When managing infectious linen:
● place directly into a water-soluble/alginate bag and secure;
● place the water-soluble bag inside a clear polythene bag and secure;
● place the polythene bag into in the appropriately coloured (as per local policy) linen bag
(hamper).
All linen bags/receptacles must be tagged e.g. ward/care area and date. Store all
used/infectious linen in a designated, safe, lockable area whilst awaiting uplift. Organisational
preparedness plans should consider the safe storage of excess linen awaiting collection and for
maintaining supplies of clean linen for patient use.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 19 of 49
5.6 Staff uniforms/clothes
The appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) will protect staff uniform from
contamination in most circumstances. Healthcare facilities should provide changing
rooms/areas where staff can change into uniforms on arrival at work.
Organisations may consider the use of theatre scrubs for staff who do not usually wear a
uniform but who are likely to come into close contact with patients e.g. medical staff.
Healthcare laundry services should be used to launder staff uniforms. If there is no laundry
facility available, then uniforms should be transported home in a disposable plastic bag. This
bag should be disposed of into the household waste stream.
Uniforms should be laundered:
● separately from other household linen;
● in a load not more than half the machine capacity;
● at the maximum temperature the fabric can tolerate, then ironed or tumbled-dried.
NB. It is best practice to change into and out of uniforms at work and not wear them when
travelling; this is based on public perception rather than evidence of an infection risk. This does
not apply to community health workers who are required to travel between patients in the same
uniform.
5.7 Management of blood and body fluid spills
Spillages must be decontaminated in line with local policy. For an example, see Appendix 4.
5.8 Management of healthcare (including clinical) and non-clinical waste
Large volumes of waste may be generated by frequent use of PPE; advice from the local waste
management team should be sought prospectively on how to manage this.
Dispose of all waste as clinical waste.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 20 of 49
Waste from a possible or a confirmed case must be disposed of as Category B waste. The
transport of Category B waste is described in Health Technical Memorandum 07-01: Safe
management of healthcare waste. Disposal of all waste related to possible or confirmed cases
should be classified as infectious clinical waste suitable for alternative treatment, unless the
waste has other properties that would require it to be incinerated.
6. Transmission based precautions (TBPs)
for pandemic COVID-19
In addition to standard infection control precautions (SICPs), droplet precautions should be used
for patients known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19 in all healthcare settings.
● COVID-19 virus is expelled as droplets from the respiratory tract of an infected individual
(e.g. during coughing and sneezing) directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctiva of a
susceptible individual(s) or environmental surface(s).
● Droplets travel only short distances through the air; a distance of at least 1 metre has
been used for deploying droplet precautions.
However, this distance should be
considered as the minimum rather than an absolute:
● Transmission based precautions (TBPs (droplet) should be continued until the resolution
of the patient’s fever and respiratory symptoms.
6.1 Duration of precautions
Patients should remain in isolation/cohort with TBPs applied until the resolution of fever and
respiratory symptoms. The duration of TBPs may require modification based on the intelligence
gathered about COVID-19.
Patients can be discharged before resolution of symptoms provided they are deemed clinically
fit for discharge and should be advised to self-isolate as per staying at home guidance.
Discharge to long term care facilities should be discussed and agreed locally.
The decision to modify the duration of, or ‘stand down’ TBPs should be made by the clinical

COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 21 of 49
team managing the patient(s); based on patient condition and in agreement with the local
Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT).
6.2 Segregation and cohorting (inpatient settings)
6.2.1 Negative pressure isolation rooms
Special environmental controls, such as negative pressure isolation rooms, are not necessary
to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. However, in the early stages, and in high risk
settings, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may be isolated in negative pressure
rooms.
6.2.2 Single rooms
Wherever possible, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed in single
rooms. In an escalating situation there is however likely to be a lack of single rooms/isolation
facilities.
Where single/isolation rooms are in short supply, and cohorting is not yet considered
possible (patient(s) awaiting laboratory confirmation), prioritise patients who have excessive
cough and sputum production for single/isolation room placement.
Single rooms in COVID-19 segregated areas should, wherever possible, be reserved for
performing aerosol generating procedures (AGPs).
Single rooms in non-COVID-19 areas should be reserved for patients requiring isolation for
other (non-influenza-like illness) reasons.
The prioritising of patients for isolation other than suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients
should be decided locally, based on patient need and local resources.
6.2.3 Cohort areas
If a single/isolation room is not available, cohort confirmed respiratory infected patients with
other patients confirmed to have COVID-19. Ensure patients are physically separated; a
distance of at least 1 metre. Use privacy curtains between the beds to minimise opportunities
for close contact. Where possible, a designated self-contained area or wing of the healthcare
facility should be used for the treatment and care of patients with COVID-19. This area should:
● include a reception area that is separate from the rest of the facility and should, if
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 22 of 49
feasible, have a separate entrance/exit from the rest of the building;
● not be used as a thoroughfare by other patients, visitors or staff, including patients being
transferred, staff going for meal breaks, and staff and visitors entering and exiting the
building;
● be separated from non-segregated areas by closed doors; and
● have signage displayed warning of the segregated area to control entry.
Hospitals should consider creating cohort areas which differentiate the level of care required.
It
may also be prudent to consider:
● the need for cohorting in single/mixed sex wards/bays
● underlying patient condition (immunocompromised);
● age groups when cohorting children; and
● routine childhood vaccination status when cohorting children.
6.2.4 Staff cohorting
Assigning a dedicated team of staff to care for patients in isolation/cohort rooms/areas is an
additional infection control measure. This should be implemented whenever there are sufficient
levels of staff available (so as not to have a negative impact on non-affected patients’ care).
Staff who have had confirmed COVID-19 and recovered should continue to follow the infection
control precautions, including personal protective equipment (PPE), as outlined in this
document (see section 7).
6.2.5 Visitors to segregated/cohort areas
Visitors to all areas of the healthcare facility should be restricted to essential visitors only, such
as parents of paediatric patients or an affected patient’s main carer. Local risk assessment and
practical management should be considered, ensuring this is a pragmatic and proportionate
response, including the consideration of whether there is a requirement for visitors to wear PPE
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 23 of 49
or respiratory protective equipment (RPE).
Visiting may be suspended if considered appropriate. All visitors entering a segregated/cohort
area must be instructed on hand hygiene. They must not visit any other care area.
Signage to support restrictions is critical. Visitors with COVID-19 symptoms must not enter the
healthcare facility. Visitors who are symptomatic should be encouraged to leave and must not
be permitted to enter areas where there are immunocompromised patients.
6.3 Patient transfers and transport
6.3.1 Intra-hospital transfers:
● The movement and transport of patients from their single room/cohort area should be
limited to essential purposes only. Staff at the receiving destination must be informed
that the patient has or is suspected to have COVID-19.
● If transport/movement is necessary, consider offering the patient a fluid-resistant (Type
IIR) surgical mask (FRSM) to be worn during transportation, to minimise the dispersal of
respiratory droplets when this can be tolerated.
● Patients must be taken straight to and returned from clinical departments and must not
wait in communal areas. If possible, patients should be placed at the end of clinical lists.
6.3.2 Transfer from primary care/community settings:
● If transfer from a primary care facility or community setting to hospital is required, the
ambulance service should be informed of the infectious status of the patient.
● Staff of the receiving ward/department should be notified in advance of any transfer and
must be informed that the patient has or is suspected to have COVID-19.
6.3.3 Inter-hospital transfers:
● Patient transfer from one healthcare facility to another should be avoided; transfer may
be undertaken if medically necessary for specialist care arising out of complications or
concurrent medical events (for example, cardiac angioplasty, and renal dialysis). If
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 24 of 49
transfer is essential, the ambulance service and receiving hospital must be advised in
advance of the infectious status of the patient.
6.4 Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Personal protective equipment (PPE) for the care of patients with COVID-19 is summarised in
Table 1, see Appendix 3 for how to put on and remove PPE.

6.4.1 Fluid resistant (Type IIR) surgical face masks (FRSM)
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 25 of 49
Fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical masks (FRSMs) are worn to protect the wearer from the
transmission of COVID-19 by respiratory droplets.
In all healthcare settings:
● A FRSM must be worn when working in close contact (within 1 metre) of a patient with
COVID-19 symptoms.
This provides a physical barrier to minimise contamination of the
mucosa of the mouth and nose.
● In an area where pandemic COVID-19 patients have been cohorted together, it may be
more practical for staff to wear a FRSM at all times, rather than only when in close
contact with a patient. Similarly, in primary care/outpatient settings it may be more
practical for staff working in a segregated (COVID-19 patient) area to wear a FRSM for
the duration they are in the patient area.
●
A FRSM for COVID-19 should:
– be well fitted covering both nose and mouth;
– not be allowed to dangle around the neck of the wearer after or between each
use;
– not be touched once put on;
– be changed when they become moist or damaged;
– be removed outside the patient room, cohort area or 1 metre away from the
patient with possible/confirmed COVID-19; and
– be worn once and then discarded as healthcare (clinical) waste (hand
hygiene must always be performed after disposal).
The provision of a FRSM for patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 at point of
assessment or triage in any healthcare setting should be considered if the patient can tolerate it
(except when in a dedicated COVID-19 area).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 26 of 49
6.4.2 Filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirators
Filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirators should be worn whenever there is a risk of
airborne transmission of pandemic COVID-19 i.e. during aerosol generating procedures (AGPs)
and at all times in intensive care unit (ICU), intensive therapy unit (ITU), high dependency unit
(HDU) where COVID-19 patients are cohorted.
All tight fitting respiratory protective equipment (RPE) (i.e. FFP3 respirators) must be:
● single use (disposable) and fluid-resistant*. Fluid resistant FFP3’s should be worn with
appropriate eye protection;
● fit tested on all healthcare staff who may be required to wear an FFP3 respirator to
ensure an adequate seal/fit according to the manufacturers’ guidance; fit checked
(according to the manufacturers’ guidance) every time an FFP3 respirator is donned to
ensure an adequate seal has been achieved;
● compatible with other facial protection used i.e. protective eyewear so that this does not
interfere with the seal of the respiratory protection. Regular corrective spectacles are not
considered adequate eye protection;
● disposed of and replaced if breathing becomes difficult, the respirator is damaged or
distorted, the respirator becomes obviously contaminated by respiratory secretions or
other body fluids, or if a proper face fit cannot be maintained; and
● be worn once and then discarded as healthcare (clinical) waste (hand hygiene
must always be performed after disposal).
*If wearing a FFP3 that is not fluid resistant, a full face shield/ visor must be worn
A FFP3 respirator, although ‘single use’, can be worn for as long as comfortable, for example
for the duration of a ward round or providing clinical care.
Once separated from the face FFP3s must be discarded.
In the absence of an anteroom/lobby remove FFP3 respirators in a safe area (e.g. outside the
isolation/cohort room/area).
All other PPE should be removed in the patient care area.

and Safety Executive website.

Page 28 of 49
6.5 Aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs)
Aerosols generated by medical procedures are one route for the transmission of the COVID-19
virus. The following procedures are considered to be potentially infectious AGPs:
● Intubation, extubation and related procedures;
● Tracheotomy/tracheostomy procedures;
● Manual ventilation;
● Open suctioning;
● Bronchoscopy;
● Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) e.g. Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) and
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ventilation (CPAP);
● Surgery and post-mortem procedures in which high-speed devices are used;
● High-frequency oscillating ventilation (HFOV);
● High-flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO)
● Induction of sputum (see glossary);
● Some dental procedures (e.g. high speed drilling).
For patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19, any of these potentially infectious AGPs
should only be carried out when essential. Where possible, these procedures should be carried
out in a single room with the doors shut. Only those healthcare staff who are needed to
undertake the procedure should be present. A disposable, fluid repellant surgical gown, gloves,
eye protection and a FFP3 respirator should be worn by those undertaking the procedure and
those in the room.
Certain other procedures/equipment may generate an aerosol from material other than patient
secretions but are not considered to represent a significant infectious risk. Procedures in this
category include:
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 29 of 49
● administration of pressurised humidified oxygen;
● administration of medication via nebulisation.
Note: During nebulisation, the aerosol derives from a non-patient source (the fluid in the
nebuliser chamber) and does not carry patient-derived viral particles. If a particle in the aerosol
coalesces with a contaminated mucous membrane, it will cease to be airborne and therefore
will not be part of an aerosol. Staff should use appropriate hand hygiene when helping patients
to remove nebulisers and oxygen masks.
6.6 Management of equipment and the care environment
Decontamination of equipment and the care environment must be performed using either:
● A combined detergent/disinfectant solution at a dilution of 1,000 parts per million
available chlorine (ppm available chlorine (av.cl.)); or
● A general purpose neutral detergent in a solution of warm water followed by a
disinfectant solution of 1,000ppm av.cl.
Only cleaning (detergent) and disinfectant products supplied by employers are to be used.
Products must be prepared and used according to the manufacturers’ instructions and
recommended product ""contact times"" must be followed. If alternative cleaning
agents/disinfectants are to be used, they should only on the advice of the IPCT and conform to
EN standard 14476 for virucidal activity
6.6.1 Equipment
Patient care equipment should be single-use items if possible. Reusable (communal) non-
invasive equipment should as far as possible be allocated to the individual patient or cohort of
patients.
Reusable (communal) non-invasive equipment must be decontaminated:
● between each patient and after patient use;
● after blood and body fluid contamination; and
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 30 of 49
● at regular intervals as part of equipment cleaning.
An increased frequency of decontamination should be considered for reusable non-invasive
care equipment when used in isolation/cohort areas.
• ventilators should be protected with a high efficiency filter, such as BS EN 13328-1
• closed system suction should be used
See Appendix 4 for guidance on routine decontamination of reusable non-invasive patient care
equipment.
Avoid the use of fans that re-circulate the air.10
There is no need to use disposable plates or cutlery. Crockery and cutlery can be washed by
hand or in a dishwasher using household detergent and hand-hot water after use.
6.6.2 Environment
Patient isolations rooms, cohort areas and clinical rooms must be decontaminated at least
daily. Clinical rooms should also be decontaminated after clinical sessions for patients with
suspected/known pandemic COVID-19. In addition, patient isolation rooms must be terminally
cleaned:
● Following resolution of symptoms, discharge or transfer (this includes removal and
laundering of all curtains and bed screens);
● Once vacated by staff following an AGP. Clearance of infectious particles after an AGP
is dependent on the mechanical/natural ventilation and air change per hour(ACH) within
the room. A single air change is estimated to remove 63% of airborne contaminants;
after 5 air changes, less than 1% of airborne contamination is thought to remain.
In an
isolation room with 10-12 ACH a minimum of 20 minutes is considered pragmatic; in a
side room with 6 ACH this would be approximately 1 hour. Advice should be sought from
the local Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT).
An increased frequency of decontamination should be incorporated into the environmental
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 31 of 49
decontamination schedules for areas where there may be higher environmental contamination
rates e.g.
● toilets/commodes particularly if patients have diarrhoea; and
● “frequently touched” surfaces such as medical equipment, door/toilet handles and locker
tops, patient call bells, over bed tables and bed rails should be cleaned at least twice
daily and when known to be contaminated with secretions, excretions or body fluids.
Domestic/cleaning staff performing environmental decontamination should:
● be allocated to specific area(s) and not be moved between COVID-19 and non-COVID-
19 care areas;
● be trained in which personal protective equipment (PPE) to use and the correct methods
of wearing, removing and disposing of PPE. The care environment should be kept clean
and clutter free. All non-essential items including toys, books and magazines should be
removed from reception and waiting areas, consulting and treatment rooms, emergency
departments, day rooms and lounges.
When made available, these items should not be
shared. All toys must be cleanable and should be cleaned regularly (preferably at the
same time as the environment).
6.7 Handling dead bodies
The principles of Standard Infection Control Precautions (SICPs) and Transmission Based
Precautions (TBPs) continue to apply whilst deceased individuals remain in the care
environment. This is due to the ongoing risk of infectious transmission via contact although the
risk is usually lower than for living patients. Where the deceased was known or suspected to
have been infected with COVID-19, there is no requirement for a body bag, and viewing,
hygienic preparations, post-mortem and embalming are all permitted.
Following a risk assessment of the potential post-mortem risk pathways PHE has developed
this advice in line with the principles set out in the HSE guidance for droplet transmission risk
as set out in: ‘Managing infection risks when handling the deceased: Guidance for the
mortuary, post-mortem room and funeral premises, and during exhumation’.

COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 32 of 49
7. Occupational health and staff
deployment
Prompt recognition of cases of COVID-19 among healthcare staff is essential to limit the
spread. Healthcare staff with influenza-like illness should not come to work. As a general
principle, healthcare staff who provide care in areas for suspected/confirmed patients should not
care for other patients, although exceptions may be necessary.
A risk assessment is required for health and social care staff at high risk of complications from
COVID-19, including pregnant staff. Employers should:
● Discuss with employees who are at risk or are pregnant the need to be deployed away from
areas used for the care of those who have, or are clinically suspected of having, COVID-19;
or, in the primary care setting, from clinics set up to manage people with COVID-19
symptoms.
● Ensure that advice is available to all healthcare staff, including specific advice to those at
risk from complications.
Bank, agency and locum staff should follow the same deployment advice as permanent staff.
As part of their employer’s duty of care, providers have a role to play in ensuring that a fit
testing programme is in place for those who may need to wear filtering face piece (class 3)
(FFP3) respirator. In the event of a breach in infection control procedures e.g. an incorrectly worn
FFP3 respirator during a potentially infectious aerosol generating procedure (AGP, staff should
be reviewed by occupational health.
Occupational health departments should lead on the implementation of systems to monitor staff
illness and absence.
Where possible, staff who have had confirmed COVID-19 (early in the stages of the outbreak
this would be via virology confirmation, thereafter, this is likely to be as per case definition)
should work in the cohort areas and care for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients. Such
staff should continue to follow the infection control precautions, including personal protective
equipment (PPE), as outlined in this document.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 33 of 49
8. Specific settings
The following guidance is given to assist specific care settings to implement the principles of
standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission based precautions (TBPs)
described in this document, which apply in all care settings.
8.1 Care home settings
Isolation within a care home for a known/suspected infection can be achieved in the persons’
bedroom in most cases. Residents should remain in their bedroom whilst considered infectious
(as described above) and the door should remain closed (if unable to isolate the individual then
this should be documented).
8.2 Primary care
In primary care settings (e.g. General Practitioner (GP) practices) suspected COVID-19
patients should be segregated in place or time from other patients, this may be achieved by:
● Creating a separate area within the facility for care of suspected patients, including
separate waiting and reception areas if possible. The area should be separated from
non-segregated areas by closed doors. To control entry, signage should be displayed
warning of the segregated area.
● Alternatively, suspected patients should be seen at a different time from other patients,
with disinfection of shared areas taking place between different clinics.
● GP practices may make arrangements for distinct COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 clinics.
(Non-essential GP clinics may need to be cancelled to enable this).
● Primary care staff should, wherever possible be allocated to either COVID-19
or
other patients.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 34 of 49
8.3 Outpatient settings
For patients who develop symptoms and have long term health conditions that require
attendance at outpatient settings e.g. hospital day care, options include:
● deferring the procedure and re-scheduling the next appointment;
● transferring the patient to a designated hospital with isolation or cohort facilities;
● introducing physical barriers such as screens in special units to separate patients with
symptoms of COVID-19.
8.4 Dental surgeries
Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 should not be seen for routine dental care. If a dental
emergency is suspected such as severe haemorrhaging or difficulty in breathing the patient
should be seen in a hospital environment.
If emergency dental care is required staff in attendance should be kept to a minimum and must
wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (see table 1) particularly if this involves
high speed drilling section 6.5.
8.5 Home visits
Home visits should continue as long as required to patients without COVID-19. If it becomes
necessary to suspend some home visits, alternative arrangements must be put in place to
maintain contact (e.g. telephone liaison). Health and social care staff performing non-deferrable
essential visits (for example, child protection) to households with suspected/confirmed COVID-
19, should follow the infection control precautions in this document.
8.6 Ambulances
In ambulances, patient segregation can be achieved by:
● designating an ambulance(s) for transfer of patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19
for the duration of each shift;
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 35 of 49
● transporting coughing and sneezing patients on their own whenever possible. However, if
pressure upon the service occurs, two patients with symptoms of COVID-19 may be
transferred together and should wear a fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask (FRSM).
Depending on the stage of the pandemic and an assessment of risk, ambulance staff may be
required to wear respiratory protective equipment (RPE). This will be determined locally.
8.7 Emergency departments and acute assessment units
Emergency departments and acute assessment units may be overwhelmed with patients
seeking care during the peak of a pandemic. Alternative approaches to triage and initial
assessment will be required to:
● rapidly screen and identify those who have symptoms of COVID-19 upon their arrival;
● separate symptomatic patients from others to reduce the risk of transmission; and
● determine as early as possible the type of care patients will require (i.e. see and
discharge or admit for treatment).
8.7.1 Screening and triage
Signage should be displayed prior to and on entry to assessment units instructing patients with
symptoms to inform reception staff immediately on their arrival.
A triage practitioner(s) should be based in the reception to manage patient flow, including
deferral of patients who do not require emergency care.
8.7.2 Reception area
Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 should be triaged to a segregated waiting and
assessment area immediately. Patients should be instructed to stay in this waiting area and not
visit other departments or, parts of the hospital/unit, or go to public areas such as the cafeteria.
Signage and physical barriers should be used as appropriate.
If separate areas for patients with symptoms of COVID-19 cannot be established, an alternative
area/site should be set up for those at highest risk of complications from COVID-19 and who do
not have respiratory symptoms (e.g. patients presenting for dialysis, patients with a history of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 36 of 49
blood cell or organ transplantation, chemotherapy, or who are immunocompromised for other
reasons).
Patients who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 but require prompt acute care assessment
should be triaged to a specific waiting and examination area, physically separate from the
COVID-19 waiting and assessment area.
8.7.3Critical care
PPE must be worn:
• all respiratory equipment must be protected with a high efficiency filter (such as BS EN 13328-
1). This filter must be disposed of after use
• disposable respiratory equipment should be used wherever possible. Re-usable equipment
must, as a minimum, be decontaminated in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
• a closed suctioning system must be used
• ventilator circuits should not be broken unless necessary
• ventilators must be placed on standby when carrying out bagging
8.7.4 Theatres
• theatres must be informed in advance of a patient transfer of a confirmed or possible COVID-
19 positive case
• the patient should be transported directly to the operating theatre and should wear a surgical
mask if it can be tolerated
• the patient should be anaesthetised and recovered in the theatre. Staff should wear protective
clothing but only those at risk of exposure from aerosol generating procedures, i.e during
intubation need to wear FFP3 respirators and full gowns. considerations about the use of
respiratory/anaesthetic equipment are addressed in the critical care section above
• instruments and devices should be decontaminated in the normal manner in accordance with
manufacturers’ advice
• both laryngoscope handle and blade should either be single use or reprocessed in the Sterile
Supply Department. Video laryngoscope blades should be single use and scope/handle
decontaminated as per manufacture instructions.
• the theatre should be cleaned as per local policy for infected cases, paying particular attention
to hand contact points on the anaesthetic machine
• theatres should not be used by staff or patients for 20 minutes after the patient leaves if
conventionally ventilated, or 5 minutes if ultraclean ventilation is used

Appendix 7 Glossary
Aerosol-generating procedures
(AGPs)
Certain medical and patient care activities that
can result in the release of airborne particles
(aerosols). AGPs can create a risk of airborne
transmission of infections that are usually only
spread by droplet transmission.
Airborne Transmission
The spread of infection from one person to
another by airborne particles (aerosols)
containing infectious agents.
Airborne particles
Very small particles that may contain
infectious agents. They can remain in the air for
long periods of time and can be carried over
long distances by air currents. Airborne particles
can be released when a person coughs
or sneezes, and during aerosol generating
procedures (AGPs). “Droplet nuclei” are
aerosols formed from the evaporation of larger
droplet particles (see Droplet Transmission).
Aerosols formed from droplet particles in this
way behave as other aerosols.
Airborne precautions Measures used to prevent and control infections
spread without necessarily having close patient
contact via aerosols (less than or equal to 5μm)
from the respiratory tract of one individual
directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae
of another individual. Aerosols can penetrate the
respiratory system to the alveolar level.
BS/EN standards
Mandatory technical specifications created by
either the British Standards Institute (BS) or
European Standardisation Organisations (EN) in
collaboration with government bodies, industry
experts and trade associations. They aim to
ensure the quality and safety of products,
services and systems.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 44 of 49
Cohort area
An area (room, bay, ward) in which two or more
patients (a cohort) with the same confirmed
infection are placed. A cohort area should be
physically separate from other patients.
Contact precautions
Measures used to prevent and control infections
that spread via direct contact with the patient or
indirectly from the patient’s immediate care
environment (including care equipment). This is
the most common route of infection
transmission.
Contact transmission Contact transmission is the most common route
of transmission, and consists of two distinct
types: direct contact and indirect contact. Direct
transmission occurs when microorganisms are
transmitted directly from an infectious individual
to another individual without the involvement of
another contaminated person or object (fomite).
Indirect transmission occurs when
microorganisms are transmitted from an
infectious individual to another individual through
a contaminated object or person (fomite) or
person.
COVID-19 COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory
disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The
disease was discovered in China in December
2019 and has since spread around the world.
Droplet precautions
Measures used to prevent and control infections
spread over short distances (at least 1 metre (3
feet) via droplets (greater than 5μm) from the
respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a
mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another
individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory
system to above the alveolar level.
Droplet transmission
The spread of infection from one person to
another by droplets containing infectious agents.
Eye/Face protection
Worn when there is a risk from splashing of
secretion (including respiratory secretions),
eye/face protection can be achieved by the use
of any one of the following: a surgical mask with
integrated visor; a full face visor/shield; or
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 45 of 49
polycarbonate safety spectacles or equivalent;
FFP3 Respiratory protection that is worn over the nose
and mouth designed to protect the wearer from
inhaling hazardous substances, including
airborne particles (aerosols). FFP stands for
filtering face piece. There are three categories of
FFP respirator: FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3. An FFP3
respirator provides the highest level of
protection, and is the only category of respirator
legislated for use in UK healthcare settings.
Fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical face
mask (FRSM)
A disposable fluid-resistant mask worn over the
nose and mouth to protect the mucous
membranes of the wearer’s nose and mouth
from splashes and infectious droplets. FRSMs
can also be used to protect patients.
When
recommended for infection control purposes a
'surgical face mask' typically denotes a
fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask.
Fluid-resistant
A term applied to fabrics that resist liquid
penetration, often used interchangeably with
'fluid-repellent' when describing the properties of
protective clothing or equipment.
Frequently touched surfaces
Surfaces of the environment which are
commonly touched/come into contact with
human hands.
High Consequence Infectious Disease
(HCID)
In the UK, a high consequence infectious disease
(HCID) is defined according to the following
criteria: Acute infectious disease; typically has a
high case-fatality rate; may not have effective
prophylaxis or treatment; often difficult to
recognise and detect rapidly; ability to spread in
the community and within healthcare settings; and
requires an enhanced individual, population and
system response to ensure it is managed
effectively, efficiently and safely.
Healthcare/clinical waste Waste produced as a result of healthcare
activities for example soiled dressings, sharps.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 46 of 49
High risk units
Intensive care units, intensive therapy units and
high dependency units.
Incubation period
The period between the infection of an individual
by a pathogen and the manifestation of the illness
or disease it causes.
Induction of sputum Induction of sputum typically involves the
administration of nebulised saline to moisten and
loosen respiratory secretions (this may be
accompanied by chest physiotherapy (percussion
and vibration)) to induce forceful coughing.
Infectious linen
Linen that has been used by a patient who is
known or suspected to be infectious and/or linen
that is contaminated with blood and/or other body
fluids e.g. faeces.
Long term health condition
Defined as:
• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
bronchitis, emphysema or asthma
• Heart disease
• Kidney disease
• Liver disease
• Stroke or a transient ischaemic attack (TIA)
• Diabetes
• Lowered immunity as a result of disease or
medical treatment, such as steroid
medication or cancer treatment
• Neurological condition, such as
Parkinson's disease, motor neurone
disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), cerebral
palsy, or a learning disability
• Problem with spleen, including sickle cell
disease, or had spleen removed
• A BMI of 40 or above (obese).
Negative pressure isolation room
A room which maintains permanent negative
pressure i.e. air flow is from the outside adjacent
space (e.g. corridor) into the room and then
exhausted to the outdoors.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 47 of 49
New and emerging viruses (including
respiratory viruses)
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) defines emerging infectious diseases as:
• New infections resulting from changes in or
evolution of existing organisms.
• Known infections spreading to new
geographical areas or populations.
• Previously unrecognised infections
appearing in areas undergoing ecological
transformation.
• Old infections re-emerging as a result of
antibiotic resistance in known agents or
breakdown in public health measures.
Personal Protective Equipment
(PPE)
Equipment a person wears to protect themselves
from risks to their health or safety, including
exposure to infection agents. The level of PPE
required depends on: Suspected/known infectious
agent; severity of the illness caused; transmission
route of the infectious agent; and the
procedure/task being undertaken.
Respiratory droplets
A small droplet, such as a particle of moisture
released from the mouth during coughing,
sneezing, or speaking.
Respiratory symptoms ‘Respiratory symptoms’ include rhinorrhoea
(runny nose); sore throat; cough; difficulty
breathing or shortness of breath.
Segregation
Physically separating or isolating from other
people.
SARS-CoV Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,
the virus responsible for the 2003 outbreak of
human coronavirus disease.
SARS-CoV-2 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,
the virus responsible for the 2019 outbreak of
COVID-19 disease.
Standard infection control
precautions (SICPs)
SICPs are the basic infection prevention and
control measures necessary to reduce the risk of
transmission of an infectious agent from both
recognised and unrecognised sources of

Purpose
1. The purpose of this document is to set out the minimum operating standards for
each element of the patient pathway (see flowcharts on pages 3 and 4) from
identification of a possible COVID-19 case, through co-ordination of required
steps and on to discharge.
2. The initial phase will involve the isolation of all individuals testing positive for
COVID-19 within the High Consequence Infectious Disease (HCID) network,
with that network co-ordinating the response once a positive response has
been confirmed by Public Health England (PHE). This is part of the
‘containment’ strategy to slow/halt any outbreak.
3. If case numbers increase significantly, the strategy may change to infected but
otherwise well individuals being isolated at home, or on wards (as clinically
appropriate). The pathway and interfaces between decision makers should
remain the same but the ‘co-ordination’ phase may be different.
4. Each local system must ensure it has a pathway in place that can deliver the
minimum standards set out in this document from identification to discharge.
These standards may be delivered in a way that best fits local/regional
operating models.
5. This is a live document which will be updated as the situation develops and
contains links to national guidance and should be referred to when guidance is
updated to ensure that the pathway remains intact with appropriate governance
mechanisms in place.
Principles
Pathway 1: Primary presentation of suspected case
There are two phases in the pathway of an individual presenting to NHS 111 with
symptoms they attribute to COVID-19 or a concern they have had direct contact with
a case of COVID-19.
• Phase 1: The identification phase
- An individual, wherever they may be (healthcare setting or community),
has a concern they meet the latest case definitions that would require
further action.
V 2.3 27/02/2020
3
- This individual should remove themselves from other people (at home, at
work/public space or in a healthcare setting) to a minimum distance of two
metres and ideally in a separate room and be directed to call NHS 111.
- NHS 111 is the gatekeeper to this pathway.
- NHS 111 has six possible outcomes after assessing this individual.
- If further action is required NHS 111 passes the responsibility for securing
that action to the COVID-19 co-ordination service and the co-ordination
phase begins.
• Phase 2: The co-ordination phase
- Once the individual has been referred to the co-ordination phase, then
NHS 111 no longer holds the clinical responsibility for that individual.
Pathway 2: Presentation of self-isolated patient with intercurrent illness or
exacerbation of known co-morbidity
Once a patient is placed under self-isolation for suspected or confirmed COVID-19
risk there is potential they may require further clinical input outside their ongoing
COVID-19 management. Pathway 2 describes the potential routes a patient may
follow for the management of intercurrent illness or an exacerbation of a co-
morbidity.
- NHS 111 is the gatekeeper to this pathway.
- The NHS 111 assessment will result in one of five possible dispositions.
-
If a patient requires a face-to-face clinical review, then NHS 111 will
contact the COVID-19 co-ordination service.
- The COVID-19 co-ordination service will once again assume
responsibility for co-ordinating the subsequent management of the
patient, including returning the patient to self-isolation once treatment is
complete (should this still be needed).
- If a patient requires urgent emergency department (ED) assessment and
intervention the patient will be directed to ED with the required urgency
and managed as an HCID case with the ED receiving a priority call to
give advance warning.

1. Phase 1: Identification
1.1 Identification by NHS 111
• NHS 111 is running an COVID-19 enhanced service that will be the entry point for
all individuals concerned they may meet the case definition for COVID-19.
• The NHS 111 clinical algorithm for the first presentation of a suspected case will
lead to one of six possible outcomes:
1) Case definition not met – managed as normal NHS 111 call (e.g. advice,
referral back for management in general practice, referral to emergency
department, etc).
2) Case definition not met – NHS 111 redirects to PHE helpline if individual
‘requesting information’ about COVID-19.
3) Patient meets case definition but is clinically ‘well’ and requires
co-ordination of diagnostic sampling and self-isolation (the patient does
not need to attend ED).
- NHS 111 uses the ‘priority access line’ to contact the allocated local
COVID-19 co-ordination service that then takes responsibility for the
individual from this referral point.
4) Patient meets case definition ‒ Patient requires ED attendance (but not
999 ambulance response).
- The ED is alerted to the patient before they arrive through notification by
NHS 111 via the agreed priority access line.
- If no appropriate private transport is available, then case transport co-
ordination is required (see section 3.2).
- In transit and arrival the patient should be managed as a suspected High
Consequence Infectious Disease (HCID) case, as per local protocols.
5) Patient meets case-definition ‒ Patient triaged as sufficiently unwell to
require urgent 999 ambulance conveyance to ED.
- Ambulance service is alerted to patient COVID-19 risk status before
vehicle arrival.
- Ambulance service contacts receiving ED via red phone.
- Patient managed as suspected HCID case, as per local protocols.
6) Patient identifies as a possible contact of a confirmed case or
asymptomatic with strong travel history.
- 6a) Possible contact of confirmed case: If a patient identifies as a
possible contact of a verified case, the person should be asked to call
the relevant Health Protection Team for assessment and any
necessary follow up.
- 6b) Asymptomatic patient with a relevant travel history: If a patient
presents as asymptomatic but has a strong travel history (see latest
guidance on gov.uk for country risk grading), they will be asked to self-
monitor symptoms and may be asked to self-isolate. If the patient
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-specified-countries-and-areas/covid-19-specified-countries-and-areas-with-implications-for-returning-travellers-or-visitors-arriving-in-the-uk
V 2.3 27/02/2020
7
subsequently develops symptoms, they will be asked to contact NHS
111 for further assessment.”1
NHS 111 and primary care commissioners MUST anticipate and prepare for
secondary presentations of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases that will
be in self-isolation (further guidance on preparation requirements will follow).
1.2 Minimum system requirements
• NHS 111 holds responsibility for the individual during the identification phase
according to their internal algorithms/pathways.
• All relevant staff involved in the COVID-19 response should be briefed that NHS
111 is the primary entry point to this pathway for all possible COVID-19 cases,
unless a life-threatening emergency in which case call 999.
• All relevant staff involved in the COVID-19 response should be aware of the six
possible outcomes of the NHS 111 calls.
1.3 System interoperability
• The NHS 111 service will decide, according to its algorithms, whether an
individual meets the case definition and will alert the appropriate service
according to which of the six outcomes has been selected.
• NHS 111 will not routinely contact local health protection teams (HPTs) nor PHE
by default to discuss whether or not the case definition has been met for an
individual. They may do so, however, if they require support in unusual or
complex cases.
• If there is uncertainty in a setting that leaves frontline clinicians unsure of how to
proceed, they should isolate the patient in the locality, and phone NHS 111 which
can link to the health protection team and the local COVID-19 co-ordination
service for advice.
• Once NHS 111 has alerted that service co-ordinating the next pathway steps, and
has passed on required patient details, this is to be regarded as a handover of the
clinical responsibility for this individual’s care to the team receiving the referral.
1 Currently, asymptomatic individuals returning from category 1 countries are the only patients
classified as having a ‘strong’ travel history. If patients have returned from any other country and are
asymptomatic they will be asked to self-monitor symptoms but can receive care as per normal
pathways (see Box 1)
V 2.3 27/02/2020

2. Phase 2: Co-ordination
Definition: In order to co-ordinate transportation, sampling and result reporting for
COVID-19 patients, the NHS England and NHS Improvement regional teams must
ensure there is a co-ordinating service in all healthcare systems. This will be called
the COVID-19 co-ordination service.
2.1 Minimum service requirements
2.1.1 COVID-19 co-ordination service
This COVID-19 co-ordination service must include:
1) A single point of contact for enquiries about patients in COVID-19 pathways.
2) An agreed ‘priority access line’ allowing NHS 111 to pass the referral, and
responsibility for the individual identified, to the care provider.
3) An ability to arrange transport of a possible COVID-19 case to and from the
designated local care provider 24/7 if required.
4) The ability to access appropriate diagnostic sampling services.
5) Arranging transportation of samples into the appropriate PHE diagnostic
testing laboratory.
6) A reporting mechanism to capture negative results from PHE eLab (https://phe-
elab.phe.org.uk/Authentication/Login?ReturnUrl=%2F) and ensure the notification
of results to patients and their relevant healthcare providers.2 PHE is
responsible for reporting positive results only to patients.
7) A capability to address issues arising from results received, with 24/7 access
to receiving and diverting units if required.
8) A system for co-ordinating the logistics of any patient transport required.
9) The maintenance of a log for patient tracking, unit activities and recording
lessons identified (good practice and incidents).
10) Going forward the co-ordination centre will be the source of data for situation
reporting.
11) A single point of contact for allied health services (e.g. isolation facilities,
secure facilities and mental health services).
2 For patients in self-isolation in the community or home setting their GP is also to be notified of
sample results.
For patients admitted into a receiving unit sample results are to be reported to the unit and the
patient’s GP, in this scenario the receiving unit is responsible for informing the patient.

Responsibilities
The location, hosting and resourcing of the COVID-19 co-ordination service is at the
discretion of local healthcare systems. This service could reasonably sit with an STP,
acute trust, LRF, regional team or other organisation that best fits local operating
models.
Hospitals and other diagnostic sampling services have a responsibility to notify the
COVID-19 co-ordination service of samples they have taken. This is particularly
important if there are plans to return these patients home for self-isolation.
All these processes must be co-ordinated in accordance with the up-to-date
guidance for:
- Infection and prevention control
- Case transport
- Home diagnostic sampling
- Home isolation
- Suspected and confirmed High Consequence Infectious Disease
(HCID) cases
- Public Health England notification and result reporting.
Further details can be found in the Accessories section.
2.1.2 Identification as a ‘receiving’ or ‘diverting’ unit
In acknowledgement of the complexity of the NHS landscape, sites are sensibly
considered to function for the purposes of COVID-19 management as either
‘receiving units’ or ‘diverting units’.
Whether a site is a receiving or diverting unit, all plans must be in accordance with
up-to-date guidance on:

Receiving units
Definition: Any unit that hosts a ‘Coronavirus Priority Assessment Service’ (CPAS),
including an ‘NHS 111 Coronavirus Pod’ (Pod) or other COVID-19 diagnostic
sampling service.
Minimum requirements
Priority access line
• A telephone number agreed between a local NHS 111 provider and a
‘receiving unit’ to alert the unit to a suspected COVID-19 case in any location.
• NHS 111 uses this line to convey patient details to the ‘receiving unit’ and
hence make a formal referral for the next steps in care.
Note: The priority access line was previously proposed as being the ED ‘red
phone’. However, as ambulance 999 or ED attendance disposition cases will
still use the red phone, NHS 111 referral of non-ED bound cases for
diagnostic swabbing must have access to a separate priority line to avoid the
red phone being overwhelmed.
• Priority access lines must be staffed throughout the opening hours of the
receiving unit by an individual who is able to respond; an answerphone or
voicemail is not acceptable.
• Any ‘receiving units’ not open 24/7 must have regional agreement for out-of-
hours cover.
Allocation as a receiving unit
• EDs and most urgent treatment centres (UTCs) should be designated as
receiving units.
• Any UTC unable to provide 24/7 cover must agree out-of-hours arrangements
with all relevant stakeholders.
• Walk-in-centres (WiCs) and minor injury units (MIUs) must agree with their
regional teams on a case-by-case basis whether they can fulfil the minimum
requirements of a receiving unit.
If a unit is unable to meet the minimum requirements of a ‘receiving unit’, then
they will revert by default to being defined as a ‘diverting unit’.
Your NHS England/NHS Improvement regional operations and EPRR teams are
there to support you in ensuring your local health system can provide the capability
required.
V 2.3 27/02/2020

Diverting units
Definition: Any unit that does not have a CPAS or a diagnostic sampling service
defaults to be a diverting unit.
Minimum requirements
Local plans to avoid suspected COVID-19 cases entering the unit
If a diverting unit encounters a suspected COVID-19 case, the primary aim is to:
• Instruct the individual to return home, enter self-isolation and enter the
pathway via NHS 111. This will protect NHS staff and members of the
public, and ensure the individual can be treated quickly and appropriately
- Local signage on all entrances should direct patients follow this course
of action.
If unable to send the individual home:
• Isolate that individual in accordance with PHE guidance to protect NHS
staff and members of the public.
• Preferably the patient, or a healthcare professional, should call NHS 111.
• After NHS 111 assessment, and if required, NHS 111 will alert the local
COVID-19 co-ordination service to organise safe conveyance of the
individual from that location to an appropriate setting in accordance with
local plans.
• Any isolation of possible COVID-19 cases will need to be managed in line
with infection and prevention control guidance.
• Following transfer of a suspected COVID-19 case:
- A decontamination of the isolation area used should be carried out
promptly in line with infection and prevention control guidance.
- The Health Protection Team should undertake a risk assessment of the
unit’s healthcare workers in contact with the suspected case and advise
on further actions.
Further specific guidance on how to continue to provide primary care to suspected
COVID-19 cases in isolation will follow.
Section 4 describes the management pathways for patients who develop intercurrent
illness or exacerbation of co-morbidities during the isolation period. If you are unsure
whether an individual poses a risk, the default is to isolate at home, or in a clinically
appropriate setting, and call NHS 111.

3 Pathway accessories required
3.1 Diagnostic sampling
The COVID-19 co-ordination service will decide which diagnostic sampling service is
most appropriate on a case-by-case basis, according to what is available locally.
Minimum requirements
- Please consult the ‘Coronavirus (COVID-19) Diagnostic Sampling
Guidance’ published by NHS England and NHS Improvement (13
February 2020) for details of the safe taking and processing of
diagnostic samples.
- Diagnostic sampling arrangements are the responsibility of the COVID-
19 co-ordination service.
- Local healthcare systems may decide to develop different diagnostic
sampling services which best suit their local healthcare providers.
- These services must adhere to the core principles of the NHSE/I and
the PHE guidance at the hyperlink below.
- Up-to-date guidance can be found here
3.2 Case transport
The COVID-19 co-ordinating service is responsible for organising the transport of
suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases around the system. The following framework
is designed to enable provider organisations to implement services locally that will
support existing arrangements to transport patients to and from units.
Minimum requirements
• Private cars (or other vehicles) can be used if driven by the individual if well,
or family and household members who have been in regular recent contact
with the individual.
• Suspected COVID-19 cases must not travel on public transport or in taxis
(private or shared).
• Providers with experience in providing patient transport services should
provide transportation services for suspected cases and receive training in
appropriate PPE infection control management.
• We recommend that COVID-19 transport request and dispatch is provided in
ambulance service Emergency Operations Centres. This should be capable
of being scaled up as needed.
• Collaboration with other healthcare transport providers may be needed to
ensure demand is met.
http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-guidance-for-clinical-diagnostic-laboratories
V 2.3 27/02/2020
13
• Transportation should adhere to PHE infection and prevention control
guidance. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-
coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control.
• The case transport response service should be run in conjunction with the
COVID-19 co-ordinating service.
• Suspected cases will be transported to the receiving unit, using the modality
and urgency of transport recommended by NHS 111.
We will shortly release the case transport framework to give more detailed
information on the requirements to deliver this service.
3.3 Infection prevention and control
The safety of NHS staff and the wider public is paramount in this response. Any
interaction with potential cases of COVID-19 must be managed by staff trained in the
relevant infection control procedures.
Minimum requirements
Personal protective equipment (PPE)
PPE requirements may differ depending on the environment the individual is being
managed in. PHE provides up-to-date guidance for PPE on its gov.uk website
including:
i) Up-to-date guidance for primary care
ii) Up-to-date guidance for secondary care
iii) Up-to-date guidance for ambulance trusts
• If in any doubt regarding how to manage a patient you are concerned does not
fit into this guidance, isolate the patient and contact your local health
protection team for support.
• Details of your local health protection team are at:
www.gov.uk/health-
protection-team
Decontamination of any area
• Any environment that has been used to isolate a possible COVID-19 case
must be promptly decontaminated in line with PHE guidance provided on
above hyperlinks.
• This includes any vehicles used for case transport.

• Any staff performing this role must be appropriately trained. Staff must also
have access to the appropriate level of PPE and associated training in its
use.
• If local plans involve any vehicles or environments that do not appear to be
covered in available guidance, please escalate this to your regional
operational and EPRR teams for support or contact your local Health
Protection Team.
Clinical waste
Large volumes of waste may be generated by frequent use of PPE. Advice from the
local waste management team should be sought in advance on how to manage this.
Dispose of all waste as clinical waste.
Waste from a possible or a confirmed case must be disposed of as Category B
waste. The transport of Category B waste is described in Health Technical
Memorandum 07-01: Safe management of healthcare waste. The Advisory
Committee on Dangerous Pathogens provided advice on waste categorisation on 31
January 2020. Further advice on clinical waste management is described
iwww.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-
and-control/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-wn-cov-infection-prevention-and-control-
guidance#waste
3.4 The role of Public Health England (PHE)
i) Confirmation of meeting the case definition
NHS 111 is not required to check with local Health Protection Teams, or other
functions of PHE, whether a patient is suitable for sampling and testing.
If a patient meets the case definition, as defined by the algorithm at that moment in
time, then NHS 111 makes the decision to move the patient to the co-ordination
phase.
ii) Follow up of self-declared ‘suspected’ contacts of COVID-19 cases
PHE does NOT expect to be alerted by NHS 111 of ‘possible’ or ‘suspected’ contacts
who self-declare via NHS 111. These individuals are directed to self-isolate for 14
days and contact NHS 111 again should they become symptomatic.
PHE will not track contacts within the UK of possible or suspected infections outside
high-risk geographic regions, as these cases are highly unlikely to be confirmed.
If an individual is returning from a country listed by PHE as being of high risk of
COVID-19, and they are symptomatic, they will be tested for COVID-19 regardless of
contact status.

V 2.3 27/02/2020
15
If a patient states they have been a contact of a confirmed case from another
country, they will require an assessment by a clinician (this could be remotely
through 111) to determine risk of infection and next steps.
iii) Follow up of confirmed positive COVID-19 samples
PHE will be notified of positive results via its laboratory network and will co-ordinate
the next steps for confirmed COVID-19 cases (be that entry into HCID network, or
relay to the relevant COVID-19 co-ordination service if no longer in the ‘isolate and
contain’ stage).
PHE has agreed communications protocols for notifying individuals, and the wider
public, of positive results. The responsibility for this sits with the Chief Medical Officer
(CMO) in England.
It remains the responsibility of the PHE laboratory to inform the local COVID-19
co-ordination service of positive results. In current conditions, the COVID-19
co-ordination service will arrange urgent ambulance transportation for the confirmed
case to a HCID unit, with a paramedic team. The local clinician responsible for the
patients care must undertake the following actions for any positive case:
a. Checking if the patient is clinically stable
b. Confirming the patient’s current address and status to regional and
national EPRR teams.
c. Informing NHS England and NHS Improvement EPRR to confirm the
above has taken place so the HCID network conference call can be
activated.
d. Joining the HCID network call to convey accurate clinical and
demographic information; including any relevant information on the
social situation (including whether there are children needing care, etc).
e. Remaining locally responsible for patient care until the patient is being
conveyed to an Infectious Diseases Unit.
Through the laboratory reporting system, PHE is notified of positive cases of COVID-
19.
PHE is also informed internally and then identifies the list of contacts of the case
and follows up each contact. This may not always be carried out by the local Health
Protection Team where the case has been identified.
iv) Contact tracing of confirmed COVID-19 cases:
PHE is responsible for identifying any contacts of confirmed positive cases. PHE
does not follow up contacts of suspected or possible (and unconfirmed cases) as the
contact tracing starts on notification of a confirmed case and is comprehensive and
rigorous.
v) Follow-up of negative test results
The COVID-19 co-ordination service will be responsible for disseminating negative
results to patients, providers and the local responsible clinicians.
V 2.3 27/02/2020
16
Each region’s COVID-19 co-ordination service must have be able to disseminate
negative results.
Each COVID-19 co-ordination service must agree with the relevant laboratories how
these results will be communicated to them and the appropriate next steps that
should be taken.
V 2.3 27/02/2020

4 Managing illness during self-isolation
As described in section 1, NHS 111 and regional primary care commissioners must
anticipate and prepare for the development of intercurrent illness or exacerbation of
co-morbidities during the self-isolation period.
If a patient develops new symptoms during their period of self-isolation they are
advised to call 111 where risk assessment will be performed. There are five potential
dispositions that could result from this interaction. Two of them follow normal, non-
COVID-19 pathways but three will require involvement of the COVID-19 co-
ordination service, case transport service (See Pathway 2: Presentation of self-
isolated patient with intercurrent illness or exacerbation of known co-morbidity,
further guidance on this will follow)
4.1 Illness during self-isolation dispositions
The five dispositions are:
1) Self-management disposition – Patient is well, has received advice from
NHS 111 and can manage symptoms at home without further clinical input.
2) Remote consultation disposition – Patient requires virtual input from a
clinician via telephone and can be managed remotely. 111 will refer this
patient a suitable local service. Remote consultation clinicians will also
have access to the priority access line if, following remote
consultation, they believe the patient is sufficiently unwell to require
a face-to-face consultation.
3) Face-to-face primary care consultation – Patient requires face-to-face
assessment and management by primary care provider. Contact will be
made via the priority access line to the COVID-19 co-ordination service
who will arrange assessment and ongoing management (further guidance
to follow)
4) ED disposition non-999 – Patient is sufficiently unwell to require
assessment in an Emergency Department, patient will be transported from
self-isolation to ED for assessment and management co-ordinated via
COVID-19 co-ordination service using the COVID-19 case transport
service.
5) ED disposition 999 – Patient is sufficiently unwell to require urgent
assessment in Emergency Department, patient will be transported from
self-isolation to ED for assessment and management co-ordinated via
COVID-19 co-ordination service and case transport service.",12657a92-ef48-4908-af61-ed128232bfa1.pdf

1. Introduction
This document outlines the infection prevention and control advice for healthcare workers
involved in receiving, assessing and caring for patients who are a possible or confirmed case of
COVID-19.
It is based on the best evidence available from previous pandemic and inter-
pandemic periods and focuses on the infection prevention and control aspects of this disease
only, recognising that a preparedness plan will consider other counter measures.
The infection prevention and control advice in this document is considered good practice in
response to this COVID-19 pandemic.
N.B. The emerging evidence base on COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. Further updates may
be made to this guidance as new detail or evidence emerges.
1.1 Scope and purpose
This document provides guidance and information on infection prevention and control
procedures to inform and advise local healthcare planning for COVID-19. This guidance has
been written for the NHS, but the infection prevention and control principles apply to other
settings where healthcare is delivered. It is issued jointly by the Department of Health and
Social Care (DHSC), Public Health Wales (PHW), Public Health Agency (PHA) Northern
Ireland, Health Protection Scotland (HPS) and Public Health England as official guidance.
Whilst this guidance seeks to ensure a consistent and resilient UK wide approach, some
differences in operational details and organisational responsibilities may apply in Northern
Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 7 of 49
2. Transmission characteristics of COVID-
19 and principles of infection prevention
and control
2.1 Routes of transmission
Infection control advice is based on the reasonable assumption that the transmission
characteristics of COVID-19 are similar to those of the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak. The initial
phylogenetic and immunologic similarities between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV can be
extrapolated to gain insight into some of the epidemiological characteristics. The transmission
of COVID-19 is thought to occur mainly through respiratory droplets generated by coughing and
sneezing, and through contact with contaminated surfaces.1
The predominant modes of
transmission are assumed to be droplet and contact.
For SARS-CoV, there is limited evidence
from observational studies showing a protective effect of up to 80% of masks and N95
respirators (the US equivalent of UK FFP2 respirators) used by healthcare workers however the
evidence base is sparse and indications (and compliance) for mask/respirator use in these
studies varied.2 It should be noted that N95 respirators are not recommended for use in UK
healthcare settings. In the UK, FFP3 respirators should be worn for airborne precautions and
must be compliant with BS EN149:200.1 For SARS-CoV, evidence suggests that use of both
respirators and surgical face masks offer a similar level of protection, both associated with up to
an 80% reduction in risk of infection.2 During AGPs there is an increased risk of aerosol spread
of infectious agents irrespective of the mode of transmission (contact, droplet, or airborne)
(Section 6.5 AGPs), and airborne precautions must be implemented when performing AGPs,
including those carried out on a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.
In light of the above, the Department of Health and Social Care’s New and Emerging
Respiratory Virus Threat Assessment Group (NERVTAG) have recommended that airborne
precautions should be implemented at all times in clinical areas considered AGP ‘hot spots’ e.g.
Intensive Care Units (ICU), Intensive Therapy Units (ITU) or High Dependency Units (HDU) that
are managing COVID-19 patients (unless patients are isolated in a negative pressure isolation
room/or single room, where only staff entering the room need wear a respirator).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 8 of 49
In other areas a fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask (FRSM) is recommended; all general
ward staff, community, ambulance and social care staff should wear an FRSM for close patient
contact (within 1 metre), unless performing an AGP, when a filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3)
respirator, eye protection, a disposable long sleeved gown and gloves should be worn.
Initial research has identified the presence of live COVID-19 virus in the stools and conjunctival
secretions of confirmed cases.1
All secretions (except sweat) and excretions, including
diarrhoeal stools from patients with known or suspected COVID-19, should be regarded as
potentially infectious.
2.2 Incubation and infectious period
Assessment of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 cases suggests
that, similar to SARS-CoV, patients will not be infectious until the onset of symptoms.
In most
cases, individuals are usually considered infectious while they have symptoms; how infectious
individuals are, depends on the severity of their symptoms and stage of their illness. The median
time from symptom onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately 2 weeks and is 3-6
weeks for severe or critical cases.3
There have been case reports that suggest infectivity
during the asymptomatic period, with one patient found to be shedding virus before the onset of
symptoms.4
Further study is required to determine the actual occurrence and impact of
asymptomatic transmission.
Precautions in section 5: Standard Infection Control Precautions (SICPs) and section 6:
Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs) should remain in place until symptoms resolve.
From international data, the balance of evidence is that infectivity has significantly reduced 7
days after the onset of symptoms.
2.3 Survival in the environment
In light of limited data for SARS-CoV-2, evidence was assessed from studies conducted with
previous human coronaviruses including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Human coronaviruses
can survive on inanimate objects and can remain viable for up to 5 days at temperatures of 22-
25°C and relative humidity of 40-50% (which is typical of air-conditioned indoor environments).1
Survival on environmental surfaces is also dependent on the surface type.1
An experimental
study using a SARS-CoV-2 strain reported viability on plastic for up to 72 hours, for 48 hours on
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 9 of 49
stainless steel and up to 8 hours on copper.1 Viability was quantified by end-point titration on
Vero E6 cells. Extensive environmental contamination may occur following an aerosol
generating procedure (AGP). The rate of clearance of aerosols in an enclosed space is
dependent on the extent of any mechanical/natural ventilation – the greater the number of air
changes per hour (ventilation rate), the sooner any aerosol will be cleared.5 The time required
for clearance of aerosols, and thus the time after which the room can be entered without a
filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirator, can be determined by the number of air changes
per hour (ACH) as outlined in WHO guidance; in general wards and single rooms there should
be a minimum of 6 air changes per hour, in negative-pressure isolation rooms there should be
a minimum of 12 air changes per hour.6 Where feasible, environmental
decontamination
should be performed when it is considered appropriate to enter the room/area without an FFP3
respirator. A single air change is estimated to remove 63% of airborne contaminants, after 5 air
changes less than 1% of airborne contamination is thought to remain.7 A minimum of 20
minutes i.e. 2 air changes, in hospital settings where the majority of these procedures occur is
considered pragmatic.
The precautions described in section 5.2: Hand hygiene and section 6.6: Management of
patient care environment and equipment should be followed.

3. Organisational preparedness for
preventing and controlling COVID-19
Limiting transmission of COVID-19 in the healthcare setting requires a range of infection
prevention and control measures which can be considered as a hierarchy of controls.
Administrative controls are implemented at an organisational level (e.g. the design and use of
appropriate processes, systems and engineering controls, and provision and use of suitable
work equipment and materials) to help prevent the introduction of infection and to control and
limit the transmission of infection in healthcare. The control of exposure at source, including
adequate ventilation systems and effective environmental decontamination will physically
reduce exposure to infection. Employers are under a legal obligation – under control of
substances hazardous to health (COSHH) – to adequately control the risk of exposure to
hazardous substances where exposure cannot be prevented. The provision and use of personal
protective equipment (PPE), including respiratory protective equipment (RPE), will protect staff,
patients and visitors. Employees have an obligation to make full and proper use of any control
measures, including PPE, provided by their employer. The principles below are listed as a
hierarchy of infection prevention and control measures at a local hospital/ward level. (Note that
this list is not exhaustive but includes key principles and illustrates a useful approach to
preventing and controlling COVID-19).
Hierarchy of Control measures:
● Early recognition/reporting of cases;
● Early assessment/triaging of cases;
● Implementing control measures, including:
– maintaining separation in space and/or time between suspected and confirmed
COVID-19 patients,
– educating staff, patients and visitors about Standard infection control precautions
(SICPs) and Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs),
– prompt implementation of TBPs to limit transmission,
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 11 of 49
– restricting access of ill visitors to the facility,
– instructing staff members with symptoms to stay at home and not come to work until
symptoms resolve,
– planning and implementation of strategies for surge capacity.
In preparedness for implementing these control measures all healthcare organisations should
undertake planning, and test the preparedness response for the various phases of a pandemic.
This includes:
● An assessment of their facilities’ current capabilities. Healthcare services will not be able
to operate under ‘business as usual’ during a COVID-19 pandemic. An assessment of
the practical ability to deliver care and implement control measures under the pressure
of an exceptional number of patient admissions and reduced staff numbers due to illness
must be assessed; ensuring their facilities’ most current blueprints are readily available
and accessible if needed to make necessary changes;
● An assessment of the current workforce;
● Working in a multidisciplinary team with healthcare and social care leaders/managers,
engineering, and clinical staff to plan for segregation of patients and/or services and
creation of adequate isolation rooms; identifying potential areas that could be converted
effectively with minimum modifications; and
● Defining engineering, administrative, and personnel requirements that can be efficiently
implemented during a pandemic COVID-19 event.8

Page 12 of 49
4. Infection prevention and control
precautions
Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission based precautions (TBPs)
must be used when managing patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
4.1 Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) definition
Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) are the basic infection prevention and control
measures necessary to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious agents from both
recognised and unrecognised sources. Sources include blood and other body fluids, secretions
and excretions (excluding sweat), non-intact skin or mucous membranes, and any equipment or
items in the care environment. SICPs should be used by all staff, in all care settings, at all
times, for all patients.
4.2 Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs) definition
Transmission based precautions (TBPs) are applied when SICPs alone are insufficient to
prevent cross transmission of an infectious agent. TBPs are additional infection control
precautions required when caring for a patient with a known or suspected infectious agent.
TBPs are categorised by the route of transmission of the infectious agent:
4.3 Routes of transmission:
● Contact precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission via direct
contact or indirectly from the immediate care environment (including care equipment).
This is the most common route of infection transmission.
● Droplet precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission over short
distances via droplets (>5μm) from the respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a
mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory
system to above the alveolar level. The maximum distance for cross transmission from
droplets has not been definitively determined, although a distance of approximately
1 metre (3 feet) around the infected individual has frequently been reported in the
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 13 of 49
medical literature as the area of risk.7, 9
● Airborne precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission without
necessarily having close contact via aerosols (≤5μm) from the respiratory tract of one
individual directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Aerosols
penetrate the respiratory system to the alveolar level.
Interrupting transmission of COVID-19 requires both droplet and contact precautions; if an
aerosol generating procedure (AGP) is being undertaken then airborne precautions are
required in addition to contact precautions.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 14 of 49
5. Standard infection control precautions
(SICPs)
5.1 Patient placement/assessment for infection risk
Patients must be promptly assessed for infection risk on arrival at the care area and, if possible,
prior to accepting a patient from another care area. Patients should be continuously reviewed
throughout their inpatient stay. In all healthcare settings, patients with symptoms of COVID-19
should be segregated from non-symptomatic patients as promptly as possible.
5.2 Hand hygiene
Hand hygiene is essential to reduce the transmission of infection in health and other care settings
and is a critical element of standard infection control precautions (SICPs). All staff, patients and
visitors should decontaminate their hands with alcohol based hand rub (ABHR) when entering
and leaving areas where care for –suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients is being
delivered.
Hand hygiene must be performed immediately before every episode of direct patient care and
after any activity or contact that potentially results in hands becoming contaminated, including
the removal of personal protective equipment (PPE), equipment decontamination and waste
handling: https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Your_5_Moments_For_Hand_Hygiene_Poster.pdf
Before performing hand hygiene:
● expose forearms (bare below the elbows);
● remove all hand and wrist jewellery (a single, plain metal finger ring is permitted but
should be removed (or moved up) during hand hygiene);
● ensure finger nails are clean, short and that artificial nails or nail products are not worn;
● cover all cuts or abrasions with a waterproof dressing.
https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Your_5_Moments_For_Hand_Hygiene_Poster.pdf
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 15 of 49
Technique for hand washing and rubbing
● Hand hygiene includes the use of ABHR for routine hand hygiene and hand washing with
soap and water, including thorough drying, if hands are visibly soiled or dirty.
● The technique for hand washing must be carried out thoroughly and for a time period
sufficient to inactivate the virus i.e. 40 to 60 seconds. See Appendix 1 – Best practice
how to hand wash.
● ABHR must be available for all staff as near to point of care as possible, where this is not
practical, personal dispensers should be used. The technique for use of ABHR to
decontaminate hands must be carried out thoroughly and for a time period sufficient to
inactivate the virus i.e. 20 to 30 seconds. See Appendix 2.
● Where no running water is available or hand hygiene facilities are lacking, such as in a
patient’s home, staff may use hand wipes followed by ABHR and should wash their
hands at the first available opportunity.
5.3 Respiratory and cough hygiene – ‘Catch it, bin it, kill it’
Patients, staff and visitors should be encouraged to minimise potential COVID-19 transmission
through good respiratory hygiene measures:
● Disposable, single-use tissues should be used to cover the nose and mouth when
sneezing, coughing or wiping and blowing the nose. Used tissues should be disposed of
promptly in the nearest waste bin.
● Tissues, waste bins (lined and foot operated) and hand hygiene facilities should be
available for patients, visitors and staff.
● Hands should be cleaned (using soap and water if possible, otherwise using ABHR) after
coughing, sneezing, using tissues or after any contact with respiratory secretions and
contaminated objects.
● Encourage patients to keep hands away from the eyes, mouth and nose.
● Some patients (e.g. the elderly and children) may need assistance with containment of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 16 of 49
respiratory secretions; those who are immobile will need a container (e.g. a plastic bag)
readily at hand for immediate disposal of tissues.
● In common waiting areas or during transportation, symptomatic patients may wear a
fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical face mask (FRSM), if tolerated, to minimise the
dispersal of respiratory secretions and reduce environmental contamination.
5.4 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Before undertaking any procedure, staff should assess any likely exposure and ensure PPE is
worn that provides adequate protection against the risks associated with the procedure or task
being undertaken. All staff should be trained in the proper use of all PPE that they may be
required to wear.
In addition:
● Staff who have had and recovered from COVID-19 should continue to follow infection
control precautions, including the PPE recommended in this document.
All PPE should be:
● compliant with the relevant BS/EN standards (European technical standards as adopted
in the UK);
● located close to the point of use;
● stored to prevent contamination in a clean/dry area until required for use (expiry dates
must be adhered to);
● single-use only;
● changed immediately after each patient and/or following completion of a procedure or task;
and
● disposed of after use into the correct waste stream i.e. healthcare/clinical waste (this may
require disposal via orange or yellow bag waste; local guidance will be provided depending
on the impact of the disease)
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 17 of 49
5.4.1 Disposable apron/gown
Disposable plastic aprons must be worn to protect staff uniform or clothes from contamination
when providing direct patient care and during environmental and equipment decontamination.
Fluid-resistant gowns must be worn when a disposable plastic apron provides inadequate cover
of staff uniform or clothes for the procedure/task being performed and when there is a risk of
extensive splashing of blood and/or other body fluids e.g. during aerosol generating procedures
(AGPs). If non fluid-resistant gowns are used, a disposable plastic apron should be worn
underneath.
Disposable aprons and gowns must be changed between patients and immediately after
completion of a procedure/task.
5.4.2 Disposable gloves
Disposable gloves must be worn when providing direct patient care and when exposure to
blood and/or other body fluids is anticipated/likely, including during equipment and
environmental decontamination. Gloves must be changed immediately following the care
episode or the task undertaken.
5.4.3 Eye protection/Face visor
Eye/face protection should be worn when there is a risk of contamination to the eyes from
splashing of secretions (including respiratory secretions), blood, body fluids or excretions. An
individual risk assessment should be carried out prior to/at the time of providing care.
Disposable, single-use, eye/face protection is recommended.
Eye/face protection can be achieved by the use of any one of the following:
● surgical mask with integrated visor;
● full face shield/visor;
● polycarbonate safety spectacles or equivalent;
Regular corrective spectacles are not considered adequate eye protection.
See Appendix 3 for the correct order of donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 18 of 49
5.5 Safe management of linen (laundry)
No special procedures are required; linen is categorised as ‘used’ or ‘infectious’. All linen used
in the direct care of patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 should be managed as
‘infectious’ linen. Linen must be handled, transported and processed in a manner that prevents
exposure to the skin and mucous membranes of staff, contamination of their clothing and the
environment:
Disposable gloves and an apron should be worn when handling infectious linen.
All linen should be handled inside the patient room/cohort area. A laundry receptacle should be
available as close as possible to the point of use for immediate linen deposit.
When handling linen do not:
● rinse, shake or sort linen on removal from beds/trolleys;
● place used/infectious linen on the floor or any other surfaces e.g. a locker/table top;
● re-handle used/infectious linen once bagged;
● overfill laundry receptacles; or
● place inappropriate items in the laundry receptacle e.g. used equipment/needles.
When managing infectious linen:
● place directly into a water-soluble/alginate bag and secure;
● place the water-soluble bag inside a clear polythene bag and secure;
● place the polythene bag into in the appropriately coloured (as per local policy) linen bag
(hamper).
All linen bags/receptacles must be tagged e.g. ward/care area and date. Store all
used/infectious linen in a designated, safe, lockable area whilst awaiting uplift. Organisational
preparedness plans should consider the safe storage of excess linen awaiting collection and for
maintaining supplies of clean linen for patient use.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 19 of 49
5.6 Staff uniforms/clothes
The appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) will protect staff uniform from
contamination in most circumstances. Healthcare facilities should provide changing
rooms/areas where staff can change into uniforms on arrival at work.
Organisations may consider the use of theatre scrubs for staff who do not usually wear a
uniform but who are likely to come into close contact with patients e.g. medical staff.
Healthcare laundry services should be used to launder staff uniforms. If there is no laundry
facility available, then uniforms should be transported home in a disposable plastic bag. This
bag should be disposed of into the household waste stream.
Uniforms should be laundered:
● separately from other household linen;
● in a load not more than half the machine capacity;
● at the maximum temperature the fabric can tolerate, then ironed or tumbled-dried.
NB. It is best practice to change into and out of uniforms at work and not wear them when
travelling; this is based on public perception rather than evidence of an infection risk. This does
not apply to community health workers who are required to travel between patients in the same
uniform.
5.7 Management of blood and body fluid spills
Spillages must be decontaminated in line with local policy. For an example, see Appendix 4.
5.8 Management of healthcare (including clinical) and non-clinical waste
Large volumes of waste may be generated by frequent use of PPE; advice from the local waste
management team should be sought prospectively on how to manage this.
Dispose of all waste as clinical waste.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 20 of 49
Waste from a possible or a confirmed case must be disposed of as Category B waste. The
transport of Category B waste is described in Health Technical Memorandum 07-01: Safe
management of healthcare waste. Disposal of all waste related to possible or confirmed cases
should be classified as infectious clinical waste suitable for alternative treatment, unless the
waste has other properties that would require it to be incinerated.
6. Transmission based precautions (TBPs)
for pandemic COVID-19
In addition to standard infection control precautions (SICPs), droplet precautions should be used
for patients known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19 in all healthcare settings.
● COVID-19 virus is expelled as droplets from the respiratory tract of an infected individual
(e.g. during coughing and sneezing) directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctiva of a
susceptible individual(s) or environmental surface(s).
● Droplets travel only short distances through the air; a distance of at least 1 metre has
been used for deploying droplet precautions.
However, this distance should be
considered as the minimum rather than an absolute:
● Transmission based precautions (TBPs (droplet) should be continued until the resolution
of the patient’s fever and respiratory symptoms.
6.1 Duration of precautions
Patients should remain in isolation/cohort with TBPs applied until the resolution of fever and
respiratory symptoms. The duration of TBPs may require modification based on the intelligence
gathered about COVID-19.
Patients can be discharged before resolution of symptoms provided they are deemed clinically
fit for discharge and should be advised to self-isolate as per staying at home guidance.
Discharge to long term care facilities should be discussed and agreed locally.
The decision to modify the duration of, or ‘stand down’ TBPs should be made by the clinical

Page 21 of 49
team managing the patient(s); based on patient condition and in agreement with the local
Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT).
6.2 Segregation and cohorting (inpatient settings)
6.2.1 Negative pressure isolation rooms
Special environmental controls, such as negative pressure isolation rooms, are not necessary
to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. However, in the early stages, and in high risk
settings, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may be isolated in negative pressure
rooms.
6.2.2 Single rooms
Wherever possible, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed in single
rooms. In an escalating situation there is however likely to be a lack of single rooms/isolation
facilities.
Where single/isolation rooms are in short supply, and cohorting is not yet considered
possible (patient(s) awaiting laboratory confirmation), prioritise patients who have excessive
cough and sputum production for single/isolation room placement.
Single rooms in COVID-19 segregated areas should, wherever possible, be reserved for
performing aerosol generating procedures (AGPs).
Single rooms in non-COVID-19 areas should be reserved for patients requiring isolation for
other (non-influenza-like illness) reasons.
The prioritising of patients for isolation other than suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients
should be decided locally, based on patient need and local resources.
6.2.3 Cohort areas
If a single/isolation room is not available, cohort confirmed respiratory infected patients with
other patients confirmed to have COVID-19. Ensure patients are physically separated; a
distance of at least 1 metre. Use privacy curtains between the beds to minimise opportunities
for close contact. Where possible, a designated self-contained area or wing of the healthcare
facility should be used for the treatment and care of patients with COVID-19. This area should:
● include a reception area that is separate from the rest of the facility and should, if
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 22 of 49
feasible, have a separate entrance/exit from the rest of the building;
● not be used as a thoroughfare by other patients, visitors or staff, including patients being
transferred, staff going for meal breaks, and staff and visitors entering and exiting the
building;
● be separated from non-segregated areas by closed doors; and
● have signage displayed warning of the segregated area to control entry.
Hospitals should consider creating cohort areas which differentiate the level of care required.
It
may also be prudent to consider:
● the need for cohorting in single/mixed sex wards/bays
● underlying patient condition (immunocompromised);
● age groups when cohorting children; and
● routine childhood vaccination status when cohorting children.
6.2.4 Staff cohorting
Assigning a dedicated team of staff to care for patients in isolation/cohort rooms/areas is an
additional infection control measure. This should be implemented whenever there are sufficient
levels of staff available (so as not to have a negative impact on non-affected patients’ care).
Staff who have had confirmed COVID-19 and recovered should continue to follow the infection
control precautions, including personal protective equipment (PPE), as outlined in this
document (see section 7).
6.2.5 Visitors to segregated/cohort areas
Visitors to all areas of the healthcare facility should be restricted to essential visitors only, such
as parents of paediatric patients or an affected patient’s main carer. Local risk assessment and
practical management should be considered, ensuring this is a pragmatic and proportionate
response, including the consideration of whether there is a requirement for visitors to wear PPE
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 23 of 49
or respiratory protective equipment (RPE).
Visiting may be suspended if considered appropriate. All visitors entering a segregated/cohort
area must be instructed on hand hygiene. They must not visit any other care area.
Signage to support restrictions is critical. Visitors with COVID-19 symptoms must not enter the
healthcare facility. Visitors who are symptomatic should be encouraged to leave and must not
be permitted to enter areas where there are immunocompromised patients.
6.3 Patient transfers and transport
6.3.1 Intra-hospital transfers:
● The movement and transport of patients from their single room/cohort area should be
limited to essential purposes only. Staff at the receiving destination must be informed
that the patient has or is suspected to have COVID-19.
● If transport/movement is necessary, consider offering the patient a fluid-resistant (Type
IIR) surgical mask (FRSM) to be worn during transportation, to minimise the dispersal of
respiratory droplets when this can be tolerated.
● Patients must be taken straight to and returned from clinical departments and must not
wait in communal areas. If possible, patients should be placed at the end of clinical lists.
6.3.2 Transfer from primary care/community settings:
● If transfer from a primary care facility or community setting to hospital is required, the
ambulance service should be informed of the infectious status of the patient.
● Staff of the receiving ward/department should be notified in advance of any transfer and
must be informed that the patient has or is suspected to have COVID-19.
6.3.3 Inter-hospital transfers:
● Patient transfer from one healthcare facility to another should be avoided; transfer may
be undertaken if medically necessary for specialist care arising out of complications or
concurrent medical events (for example, cardiac angioplasty, and renal dialysis). If
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 24 of 49
transfer is essential, the ambulance service and receiving hospital must be advised in
advance of the infectious status of the patient.
6.4 Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Personal protective equipment (PPE) for the care of patients with COVID-19 is summarised in
Table 1, see Appendix 3 for how to put on and remove PPE.

6.4.1 Fluid resistant (Type IIR) surgical face masks (FRSM)
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 25 of 49
Fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical masks (FRSMs) are worn to protect the wearer from the
transmission of COVID-19 by respiratory droplets.
In all healthcare settings:
● A FRSM must be worn when working in close contact (within 1 metre) of a patient with
COVID-19 symptoms.
This provides a physical barrier to minimise contamination of the
mucosa of the mouth and nose.
● In an area where pandemic COVID-19 patients have been cohorted together, it may be
more practical for staff to wear a FRSM at all times, rather than only when in close
contact with a patient. Similarly, in primary care/outpatient settings it may be more
practical for staff working in a segregated (COVID-19 patient) area to wear a FRSM for
the duration they are in the patient area.
●
A FRSM for COVID-19 should:
– be well fitted covering both nose and mouth;
– not be allowed to dangle around the neck of the wearer after or between each
use;
– not be touched once put on;
– be changed when they become moist or damaged;
– be removed outside the patient room, cohort area or 1 metre away from the
patient with possible/confirmed COVID-19; and
– be worn once and then discarded as healthcare (clinical) waste (hand
hygiene must always be performed after disposal).
The provision of a FRSM for patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 at point of
assessment or triage in any healthcare setting should be considered if the patient can tolerate it
(except when in a dedicated COVID-19 area).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 26 of 49
6.4.2 Filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirators
Filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirators should be worn whenever there is a risk of
airborne transmission of pandemic COVID-19 i.e. during aerosol generating procedures (AGPs)
and at all times in intensive care unit (ICU), intensive therapy unit (ITU), high dependency unit
(HDU) where COVID-19 patients are cohorted.
All tight fitting respiratory protective equipment (RPE) (i.e. FFP3 respirators) must be:
● single use (disposable) and fluid-resistant*. Fluid resistant FFP3’s should be worn with
appropriate eye protection;
● fit tested on all healthcare staff who may be required to wear an FFP3 respirator to
ensure an adequate seal/fit according to the manufacturers’ guidance; fit checked
(according to the manufacturers’ guidance) every time an FFP3 respirator is donned to
ensure an adequate seal has been achieved;
● compatible with other facial protection used i.e. protective eyewear so that this does not
interfere with the seal of the respiratory protection. Regular corrective spectacles are not
considered adequate eye protection;
● disposed of and replaced if breathing becomes difficult, the respirator is damaged or
distorted, the respirator becomes obviously contaminated by respiratory secretions or
other body fluids, or if a proper face fit cannot be maintained; and
● be worn once and then discarded as healthcare (clinical) waste (hand hygiene
must always be performed after disposal).
*If wearing a FFP3 that is not fluid resistant, a full face shield/ visor must be worn
A FFP3 respirator, although ‘single use’, can be worn for as long as comfortable, for example
for the duration of a ward round or providing clinical care.
Once separated from the face FFP3s must be discarded.
In the absence of an anteroom/lobby remove FFP3 respirators in a safe area (e.g. outside the
isolation/cohort room/area).
All other PPE should be removed in the patient care area.

Page 28 of 49
6.5 Aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs)
Aerosols generated by medical procedures are one route for the transmission of the COVID-19
virus. The following procedures are considered to be potentially infectious AGPs:
● Intubation, extubation and related procedures;
● Tracheotomy/tracheostomy procedures;
● Manual ventilation;
● Open suctioning;
● Bronchoscopy;
● Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) e.g. Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) and
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ventilation (CPAP);
● Surgery and post-mortem procedures in which high-speed devices are used;
● High-frequency oscillating ventilation (HFOV);
● High-flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO)
● Induction of sputum (see glossary);
● Some dental procedures (e.g. high speed drilling).
For patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19, any of these potentially infectious AGPs
should only be carried out when essential. Where possible, these procedures should be carried
out in a single room with the doors shut. Only those healthcare staff who are needed to
undertake the procedure should be present. A disposable, fluid repellant surgical gown, gloves,
eye protection and a FFP3 respirator should be worn by those undertaking the procedure and
those in the room.
Certain other procedures/equipment may generate an aerosol from material other than patient
secretions but are not considered to represent a significant infectious risk. Procedures in this
category include:
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 29 of 49
● administration of pressurised humidified oxygen;
● administration of medication via nebulisation.
Note: During nebulisation, the aerosol derives from a non-patient source (the fluid in the
nebuliser chamber) and does not carry patient-derived viral particles. If a particle in the aerosol
coalesces with a contaminated mucous membrane, it will cease to be airborne and therefore
will not be part of an aerosol. Staff should use appropriate hand hygiene when helping patients
to remove nebulisers and oxygen masks.
6.6 Management of equipment and the care environment
Decontamination of equipment and the care environment must be performed using either:
● A combined detergent/disinfectant solution at a dilution of 1,000 parts per million
available chlorine (ppm available chlorine (av.cl.)); or
● A general purpose neutral detergent in a solution of warm water followed by a
disinfectant solution of 1,000ppm av.cl.
Only cleaning (detergent) and disinfectant products supplied by employers are to be used.
Products must be prepared and used according to the manufacturers’ instructions and
recommended product ""contact times"" must be followed. If alternative cleaning
agents/disinfectants are to be used, they should only on the advice of the IPCT and conform to
EN standard 14476 for virucidal activity

Patient care equipment should be single-use items if possible. Reusable (communal) non-
invasive equipment should as far as possible be allocated to the individual patient or cohort of
patients.
Reusable (communal) non-invasive equipment must be decontaminated:
● between each patient and after patient use;
● after blood and body fluid contamination; and
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 30 of 49
● at regular intervals as part of equipment cleaning.
An increased frequency of decontamination should be considered for reusable non-invasive
care equipment when used in isolation/cohort areas.
• ventilators should be protected with a high efficiency filter, such as BS EN 13328-1
• closed system suction should be used
See Appendix 4 for guidance on routine decontamination of reusable non-invasive patient care
equipment.
Avoid the use of fans that re-circulate the air.10
There is no need to use disposable plates or cutlery. Crockery and cutlery can be washed by
hand or in a dishwasher using household detergent and hand-hot water after use.
6.6.2 Environment
Patient isolations rooms, cohort areas and clinical rooms must be decontaminated at least
daily. Clinical rooms should also be decontaminated after clinical sessions for patients with
suspected/known pandemic COVID-19. In addition, patient isolation rooms must be terminally
cleaned:
● Following resolution of symptoms, discharge or transfer (this includes removal and
laundering of all curtains and bed screens);
● Once vacated by staff following an AGP. Clearance of infectious particles after an AGP
is dependent on the mechanical/natural ventilation and air change per hour(ACH) within
the room. A single air change is estimated to remove 63% of airborne contaminants;
after 5 air changes, less than 1% of airborne contamination is thought to remain.
In an
isolation room with 10-12 ACH a minimum of 20 minutes is considered pragmatic; in a
side room with 6 ACH this would be approximately 1 hour. Advice should be sought from
the local Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT).
An increased frequency of decontamination should be incorporated into the environmental
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 31 of 49
decontamination schedules for areas where there may be higher environmental contamination
rates e.g.
● toilets/commodes particularly if patients have diarrhoea; and
● “frequently touched” surfaces such as medical equipment, door/toilet handles and locker
tops, patient call bells, over bed tables and bed rails should be cleaned at least twice
daily and when known to be contaminated with secretions, excretions or body fluids.
Domestic/cleaning staff performing environmental decontamination should:
● be allocated to specific area(s) and not be moved between COVID-19 and non-COVID-
19 care areas;
● be trained in which personal protective equipment (PPE) to use and the correct methods
of wearing, removing and disposing of PPE. The care environment should be kept clean
and clutter free. All non-essential items including toys, books and magazines should be
removed from reception and waiting areas, consulting and treatment rooms, emergency
departments, day rooms and lounges.
When made available, these items should not be
shared. All toys must be cleanable and should be cleaned regularly (preferably at the
same time as the environment).
6.7 Handling dead bodies
The principles of Standard Infection Control Precautions (SICPs) and Transmission Based
Precautions (TBPs) continue to apply whilst deceased individuals remain in the care
environment. This is due to the ongoing risk of infectious transmission via contact although the
risk is usually lower than for living patients. Where the deceased was known or suspected to
have been infected with COVID-19, there is no requirement for a body bag, and viewing,
hygienic preparations, post-mortem and embalming are all permitted.
Following a risk assessment of the potential post-mortem risk pathways PHE has developed
this advice in line with the principles set out in the HSE guidance for droplet transmission risk
as set out in: ‘Managing infection risks when handling the deceased: Guidance for the
mortuary, post-mortem room and funeral premises, and during exhumation’.

7. Occupational health and staff
deployment
Prompt recognition of cases of COVID-19 among healthcare staff is essential to limit the
spread. Healthcare staff with influenza-like illness should not come to work. As a general
principle, healthcare staff who provide care in areas for suspected/confirmed patients should not
care for other patients, although exceptions may be necessary.
A risk assessment is required for health and social care staff at high risk of complications from
COVID-19, including pregnant staff. Employers should:
● Discuss with employees who are at risk or are pregnant the need to be deployed away from
areas used for the care of those who have, or are clinically suspected of having, COVID-19;
or, in the primary care setting, from clinics set up to manage people with COVID-19
symptoms.
● Ensure that advice is available to all healthcare staff, including specific advice to those at
risk from complications.
Bank, agency and locum staff should follow the same deployment advice as permanent staff.
As part of their employer’s duty of care, providers have a role to play in ensuring that a fit
testing programme is in place for those who may need to wear filtering face piece (class 3)
(FFP3) respirator. In the event of a breach in infection control procedures e.g. an incorrectly worn
FFP3 respirator during a potentially infectious aerosol generating procedure (AGP, staff should
be reviewed by occupational health.
Occupational health departments should lead on the implementation of systems to monitor staff
illness and absence.
Where possible, staff who have had confirmed COVID-19 (early in the stages of the outbreak
this would be via virology confirmation, thereafter, this is likely to be as per case definition)
should work in the cohort areas and care for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients. Such
staff should continue to follow the infection control precautions, including personal protective
equipment (PPE), as outlined in this document.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 33 of 49
8. Specific settings
The following guidance is given to assist specific care settings to implement the principles of
standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission based precautions (TBPs)
described in this document, which apply in all care settings.
8.1 Care home settings
Isolation within a care home for a known/suspected infection can be achieved in the persons’
bedroom in most cases. Residents should remain in their bedroom whilst considered infectious
(as described above) and the door should remain closed (if unable to isolate the individual then
this should be documented).
8.2 Primary care
In primary care settings (e.g. General Practitioner (GP) practices) suspected COVID-19
patients should be segregated in place or time from other patients, this may be achieved by:
● Creating a separate area within the facility for care of suspected patients, including
separate waiting and reception areas if possible. The area should be separated from
non-segregated areas by closed doors. To control entry, signage should be displayed
warning of the segregated area.
● Alternatively, suspected patients should be seen at a different time from other patients,
with disinfection of shared areas taking place between different clinics.
● GP practices may make arrangements for distinct COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 clinics.
(Non-essential GP clinics may need to be cancelled to enable this).
● Primary care staff should, wherever possible be allocated to either COVID-19
or
other patients.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 34 of 49
8.3 Outpatient settings
For patients who develop symptoms and have long term health conditions that require
attendance at outpatient settings e.g. hospital day care, options include:
● deferring the procedure and re-scheduling the next appointment;
● transferring the patient to a designated hospital with isolation or cohort facilities;
● introducing physical barriers such as screens in special units to separate patients with
symptoms of COVID-19.
8.4 Dental surgeries
Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 should not be seen for routine dental care. If a dental
emergency is suspected such as severe haemorrhaging or difficulty in breathing the patient
should be seen in a hospital environment.
If emergency dental care is required staff in attendance should be kept to a minimum and must
wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (see table 1) particularly if this involves
high speed drilling section 6.5.
8.5 Home visits
Home visits should continue as long as required to patients without COVID-19. If it becomes
necessary to suspend some home visits, alternative arrangements must be put in place to
maintain contact (e.g. telephone liaison). Health and social care staff performing non-deferrable
essential visits (for example, child protection) to households with suspected/confirmed COVID-
19, should follow the infection control precautions in this document.
8.6 Ambulances
In ambulances, patient segregation can be achieved by:
● designating an ambulance(s) for transfer of patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19
for the duration of each shift;
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 35 of 49
● transporting coughing and sneezing patients on their own whenever possible. However, if
pressure upon the service occurs, two patients with symptoms of COVID-19 may be
transferred together and should wear a fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask (FRSM).
Depending on the stage of the pandemic and an assessment of risk, ambulance staff may be
required to wear respiratory protective equipment (RPE). This will be determined locally.
8.7 Emergency departments and acute assessment units
Emergency departments and acute assessment units may be overwhelmed with patients
seeking care during the peak of a pandemic. Alternative approaches to triage and initial
assessment will be required to:
● rapidly screen and identify those who have symptoms of COVID-19 upon their arrival;
● separate symptomatic patients from others to reduce the risk of transmission; and
● determine as early as possible the type of care patients will require (i.e. see and
discharge or admit for treatment).
8.7.1 Screening and triage
Signage should be displayed prior to and on entry to assessment units instructing patients with
symptoms to inform reception staff immediately on their arrival.
A triage practitioner(s) should be based in the reception to manage patient flow, including
deferral of patients who do not require emergency care.
8.7.2 Reception area
Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 should be triaged to a segregated waiting and
assessment area immediately. Patients should be instructed to stay in this waiting area and not
visit other departments or, parts of the hospital/unit, or go to public areas such as the cafeteria.
Signage and physical barriers should be used as appropriate.
If separate areas for patients with symptoms of COVID-19 cannot be established, an alternative
area/site should be set up for those at highest risk of complications from COVID-19 and who do
not have respiratory symptoms (e.g. patients presenting for dialysis, patients with a history of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 36 of 49
blood cell or organ transplantation, chemotherapy, or who are immunocompromised for other
reasons).
Patients who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 but require prompt acute care assessment
should be triaged to a specific waiting and examination area, physically separate from the
COVID-19 waiting and assessment area.
8.7.3Critical care
PPE must be worn:
• all respiratory equipment must be protected with a high efficiency filter (such as BS EN 13328-
1). This filter must be disposed of after use
• disposable respiratory equipment should be used wherever possible. Re-usable equipment
must, as a minimum, be decontaminated in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
• a closed suctioning system must be used
• ventilator circuits should not be broken unless necessary
• ventilators must be placed on standby when carrying out bagging
8.7.4 Theatres
• theatres must be informed in advance of a patient transfer of a confirmed or possible COVID-
19 positive case
• the patient should be transported directly to the operating theatre and should wear a surgical
mask if it can be tolerated
• the patient should be anaesthetised and recovered in the theatre. Staff should wear protective
clothing but only those at risk of exposure from aerosol generating procedures, i.e during
intubation need to wear FFP3 respirators and full gowns. considerations about the use of
respiratory/anaesthetic equipment are addressed in the critical care section above
• instruments and devices should be decontaminated in the normal manner in accordance with
manufacturers’ advice
• both laryngoscope handle and blade should either be single use or reprocessed in the Sterile
Supply Department. Video laryngoscope blades should be single use and scope/handle
decontaminated as per manufacture instructions.
• the theatre should be cleaned as per local policy for infected cases, paying particular attention
to hand contact points on the anaesthetic machine
• theatres should not be used by staff or patients for 20 minutes after the patient leaves if
conventionally ventilated, or 5 minutes if ultraclean ventilation is used
• possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19 should be placed at the end of the list where feasible

Appendix 7 Glossary
Aerosol-generating procedures
(AGPs)
Certain medical and patient care activities that
can result in the release of airborne particles
(aerosols). AGPs can create a risk of airborne
transmission of infections that are usually only
spread by droplet transmission.
Airborne Transmission
The spread of infection from one person to
another by airborne particles (aerosols)
containing infectious agents.
Airborne particles
Very small particles that may contain
infectious agents. They can remain in the air for
long periods of time and can be carried over
long distances by air currents. Airborne particles
can be released when a person coughs
or sneezes, and during aerosol generating
procedures (AGPs). “Droplet nuclei” are
aerosols formed from the evaporation of larger
droplet particles (see Droplet Transmission).
Aerosols formed from droplet particles in this
way behave as other aerosols.
Airborne precautions Measures used to prevent and control infections
spread without necessarily having close patient
contact via aerosols (less than or equal to 5μm)
from the respiratory tract of one individual
directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae
of another individual. Aerosols can penetrate the
respiratory system to the alveolar level.
BS/EN standards
Mandatory technical specifications created by
either the British Standards Institute (BS) or
European Standardisation Organisations (EN) in
collaboration with government bodies, industry
experts and trade associations. They aim to
ensure the quality and safety of products,
services and systems.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 44 of 49
Cohort area
An area (room, bay, ward) in which two or more
patients (a cohort) with the same confirmed
infection are placed. A cohort area should be
physically separate from other patients.
Contact precautions
Measures used to prevent and control infections
that spread via direct contact with the patient or
indirectly from the patient’s immediate care
environment (including care equipment). This is
the most common route of infection
transmission.
Contact transmission Contact transmission is the most common route
of transmission, and consists of two distinct
types: direct contact and indirect contact. Direct
transmission occurs when microorganisms are
transmitted directly from an infectious individual
to another individual without the involvement of
another contaminated person or object (fomite).
Indirect transmission occurs when
microorganisms are transmitted from an
infectious individual to another individual through
a contaminated object or person (fomite) or
person.
COVID-19 COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory
disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The
disease was discovered in China in December
2019 and has since spread around the world.
Droplet precautions
Measures used to prevent and control infections
spread over short distances (at least 1 metre (3
feet) via droplets (greater than 5μm) from the
respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a
mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another
individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory
system to above the alveolar level.
Droplet transmission
The spread of infection from one person to
another by droplets containing infectious agents.
Eye/Face protection
Worn when there is a risk from splashing of
secretion (including respiratory secretions),
eye/face protection can be achieved by the use
of any one of the following: a surgical mask with
integrated visor; a full face visor/shield; or
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 45 of 49
polycarbonate safety spectacles or equivalent;
FFP3 Respiratory protection that is worn over the nose
and mouth designed to protect the wearer from
inhaling hazardous substances, including
airborne particles (aerosols). FFP stands for
filtering face piece. There are three categories of
FFP respirator: FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3. An FFP3
respirator provides the highest level of
protection, and is the only category of respirator
legislated for use in UK healthcare settings.
Fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical face
mask (FRSM)
A disposable fluid-resistant mask worn over the
nose and mouth to protect the mucous
membranes of the wearer’s nose and mouth
from splashes and infectious droplets. FRSMs
can also be used to protect patients.
When
recommended for infection control purposes a
'surgical face mask' typically denotes a
fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask.
Fluid-resistant
A term applied to fabrics that resist liquid
penetration, often used interchangeably with
'fluid-repellent' when describing the properties of
protective clothing or equipment.
Frequently touched surfaces
Surfaces of the environment which are
commonly touched/come into contact with
human hands.
High Consequence Infectious Disease
(HCID)
In the UK, a high consequence infectious disease
(HCID) is defined according to the following
criteria: Acute infectious disease; typically has a
high case-fatality rate; may not have effective
prophylaxis or treatment; often difficult to
recognise and detect rapidly; ability to spread in
the community and within healthcare settings; and
requires an enhanced individual, population and
system response to ensure it is managed
effectively, efficiently and safely.
Healthcare/clinical waste Waste produced as a result of healthcare
activities for example soiled dressings, sharps.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 46 of 49
High risk units
Intensive care units, intensive therapy units and
high dependency units.
Incubation period
The period between the infection of an individual
by a pathogen and the manifestation of the illness
or disease it causes.
Induction of sputum Induction of sputum typically involves the
administration of nebulised saline to moisten and
loosen respiratory secretions (this may be
accompanied by chest physiotherapy (percussion
and vibration)) to induce forceful coughing.
Infectious linen
Linen that has been used by a patient who is
known or suspected to be infectious and/or linen
that is contaminated with blood and/or other body
fluids e.g. faeces.
Long term health condition
Defined as:
• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
bronchitis, emphysema or asthma
• Heart disease
• Kidney disease
• Liver disease
• Stroke or a transient ischaemic attack (TIA)
• Diabetes
• Lowered immunity as a result of disease or
medical treatment, such as steroid
medication or cancer treatment
• Neurological condition, such as
Parkinson's disease, motor neurone
disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), cerebral
palsy, or a learning disability
• Problem with spleen, including sickle cell
disease, or had spleen removed
• A BMI of 40 or above (obese).
Negative pressure isolation room
A room which maintains permanent negative
pressure i.e. air flow is from the outside adjacent
space (e.g. corridor) into the room and then
exhausted to the outdoors.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 47 of 49
New and emerging viruses (including
respiratory viruses)
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) defines emerging infectious diseases as:
• New infections resulting from changes in or
evolution of existing organisms.
• Known infections spreading to new
geographical areas or populations.
• Previously unrecognised infections
appearing in areas undergoing ecological
transformation.
• Old infections re-emerging as a result of
antibiotic resistance in known agents or
breakdown in public health measures.
Personal Protective Equipment
(PPE)
Equipment a person wears to protect themselves
from risks to their health or safety, including
exposure to infection agents. The level of PPE
required depends on: Suspected/known infectious
agent; severity of the illness caused; transmission
route of the infectious agent; and the
procedure/task being undertaken.
Respiratory droplets
A small droplet, such as a particle of moisture
released from the mouth during coughing,
sneezing, or speaking.
Respiratory symptoms ‘Respiratory symptoms’ include rhinorrhoea
(runny nose); sore throat; cough; difficulty
breathing or shortness of breath.
Segregation
Physically separating or isolating from other
people.
SARS-CoV Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,
the virus responsible for the 2003 outbreak of
human coronavirus disease.
SARS-CoV-2 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,
the virus responsible for the 2019 outbreak of
COVID-19 disease.
Standard infection control
precautions (SICPs)
SICPs are the basic infection prevention and
control measures necessary to reduce the risk of
transmission of an infectious agent from both
recognised and unrecognised sources of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 48 of 49
infection.
Single room
A room with space for one patient and usually
contains as a minimum: a bed; locker/wardrobe;
and a clinical wash-hand basin.
Staff cohorting
When staff care for one specific group of patients
and do not move between different patient
cohorts. Patient cohorts may include for example
‘symptomatic’, ‘asymptomatic and exposed’, or
‘asymptomatic and unexposed’ patient groups.
Transmission based precautions
Additional precautions to be used in addition to
SICPs when caring for patients with a known or
suspected infection or colonisation.

1. Introduction
This document outlines the infection prevention and control advice for healthcare workers
involved in receiving, assessing and caring for patients who are a possible or confirmed case of
COVID-19.
It is based on the best evidence available from previous pandemic and inter-
pandemic periods and focuses on the infection prevention and control aspects of this disease
only, recognising that a preparedness plan will consider other counter measures.
The infection prevention and control advice in this document is considered good practice in
response to this COVID-19 pandemic.
N.B. The emerging evidence base on COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. Further updates may
be made to this guidance as new detail or evidence emerges.
1.1 Scope and purpose
This document provides guidance and information on infection prevention and control
procedures to inform and advise local healthcare planning for COVID-19. This guidance has
been written for the NHS, but the infection prevention and control principles apply to other
settings where healthcare is delivered. It is issued jointly by the Department of Health and
Social Care (DHSC), Public Health Wales (PHW), Public Health Agency (PHA) Northern
Ireland, Health Protection Scotland (HPS) and Public Health England as official guidance.
Whilst this guidance seeks to ensure a consistent and resilient UK wide approach, some
differences in operational details and organisational responsibilities may apply in Northern
Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland.

2. Transmission characteristics of COVID-
19 and principles of infection prevention
and control
2.1 Routes of transmission
Infection control advice is based on the reasonable assumption that the transmission
characteristics of COVID-19 are similar to those of the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak. The initial
phylogenetic and immunologic similarities between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV can be
extrapolated to gain insight into some of the epidemiological characteristics. The transmission
of COVID-19 is thought to occur mainly through respiratory droplets generated by coughing and
sneezing, and through contact with contaminated surfaces.1
The predominant modes of
transmission are assumed to be droplet and contact.
For SARS-CoV, there is limited evidence
from observational studies showing a protective effect of up to 80% of masks and N95
respirators (the US equivalent of UK FFP2 respirators) used by healthcare workers however the
evidence base is sparse and indications (and compliance) for mask/respirator use in these
studies varied.2 It should be noted that N95 respirators are not recommended for use in UK
healthcare settings. In the UK, FFP3 respirators should be worn for airborne precautions and
must be compliant with BS EN149:200.1 For SARS-CoV, evidence suggests that use of both
respirators and surgical face masks offer a similar level of protection, both associated with up to
an 80% reduction in risk of infection.2 During AGPs there is an increased risk of aerosol spread
of infectious agents irrespective of the mode of transmission (contact, droplet, or airborne)
(Section 6.5 AGPs), and airborne precautions must be implemented when performing AGPs,
including those carried out on a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.
In light of the above, the Department of Health and Social Care’s New and Emerging
Respiratory Virus Threat Assessment Group (NERVTAG) have recommended that airborne
precautions should be implemented at all times in clinical areas considered AGP ‘hot spots’ e.g.
Intensive Care Units (ICU), Intensive Therapy Units (ITU) or High Dependency Units (HDU) that
are managing COVID-19 patients (unless patients are isolated in a negative pressure isolation
room/or single room, where only staff entering the room need wear a respirator).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 8 of 49
In other areas a fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask (FRSM) is recommended; all general
ward staff, community, ambulance and social care staff should wear an FRSM for close patient
contact (within 1 metre), unless performing an AGP, when a filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3)
respirator, eye protection, a disposable long sleeved gown and gloves should be worn.
Initial research has identified the presence of live COVID-19 virus in the stools and conjunctival
secretions of confirmed cases.1
All secretions (except sweat) and excretions, including
diarrhoeal stools from patients with known or suspected COVID-19, should be regarded as
potentially infectious.
2.2 Incubation and infectious period
Assessment of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 cases suggests
that, similar to SARS-CoV, patients will not be infectious until the onset of symptoms.
In most
cases, individuals are usually considered infectious while they have symptoms; how infectious
individuals are, depends on the severity of their symptoms and stage of their illness. The median
time from symptom onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately 2 weeks and is 3-6
weeks for severe or critical cases.3
There have been case reports that suggest infectivity
during the asymptomatic period, with one patient found to be shedding virus before the onset of
symptoms.4
Further study is required to determine the actual occurrence and impact of
asymptomatic transmission.
Precautions in section 5: Standard Infection Control Precautions (SICPs) and section 6:
Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs) should remain in place until symptoms resolve.
From international data, the balance of evidence is that infectivity has significantly reduced 7
days after the onset of symptoms.
2.3 Survival in the environment
In light of limited data for SARS-CoV-2, evidence was assessed from studies conducted with
previous human coronaviruses including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Human coronaviruses
can survive on inanimate objects and can remain viable for up to 5 days at temperatures of 22-
25°C and relative humidity of 40-50% (which is typical of air-conditioned indoor environments).1
Survival on environmental surfaces is also dependent on the surface type.1
An experimental
study using a SARS-CoV-2 strain reported viability on plastic for up to 72 hours, for 48 hours on
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 9 of 49
stainless steel and up to 8 hours on copper.1 Viability was quantified by end-point titration on
Vero E6 cells. Extensive environmental contamination may occur following an aerosol
generating procedure (AGP). The rate of clearance of aerosols in an enclosed space is
dependent on the extent of any mechanical/natural ventilation – the greater the number of air
changes per hour (ventilation rate), the sooner any aerosol will be cleared.5 The time required
for clearance of aerosols, and thus the time after which the room can be entered without a
filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirator, can be determined by the number of air changes
per hour (ACH) as outlined in WHO guidance; in general wards and single rooms there should
be a minimum of 6 air changes per hour, in negative-pressure isolation rooms there should be
a minimum of 12 air changes per hour.6 Where feasible, environmental
decontamination
should be performed when it is considered appropriate to enter the room/area without an FFP3
respirator. A single air change is estimated to remove 63% of airborne contaminants, after 5 air
changes less than 1% of airborne contamination is thought to remain.7 A minimum of 20
minutes i.e. 2 air changes, in hospital settings where the majority of these procedures occur is
considered pragmatic.
The precautions described in section 5.2: Hand hygiene and section 6.6: Management of
patient care environment and equipment should be followed.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.

3. Organisational preparedness for
preventing and controlling COVID-19
Limiting transmission of COVID-19 in the healthcare setting requires a range of infection
prevention and control measures which can be considered as a hierarchy of controls.
Administrative controls are implemented at an organisational level (e.g. the design and use of
appropriate processes, systems and engineering controls, and provision and use of suitable
work equipment and materials) to help prevent the introduction of infection and to control and
limit the transmission of infection in healthcare. The control of exposure at source, including
adequate ventilation systems and effective environmental decontamination will physically
reduce exposure to infection. Employers are under a legal obligation – under control of
substances hazardous to health (COSHH) – to adequately control the risk of exposure to
hazardous substances where exposure cannot be prevented. The provision and use of personal
protective equipment (PPE), including respiratory protective equipment (RPE), will protect staff,
patients and visitors. Employees have an obligation to make full and proper use of any control
measures, including PPE, provided by their employer. The principles below are listed as a
hierarchy of infection prevention and control measures at a local hospital/ward level. (Note that
this list is not exhaustive but includes key principles and illustrates a useful approach to
preventing and controlling COVID-19).
Hierarchy of Control measures:
● Early recognition/reporting of cases;
● Early assessment/triaging of cases;
● Implementing control measures, including:
– maintaining separation in space and/or time between suspected and confirmed
COVID-19 patients,
– educating staff, patients and visitors about Standard infection control precautions
(SICPs) and Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs),
– prompt implementation of TBPs to limit transmission,
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 11 of 49
– restricting access of ill visitors to the facility,
– instructing staff members with symptoms to stay at home and not come to work until
symptoms resolve,
– planning and implementation of strategies for surge capacity.
In preparedness for implementing these control measures all healthcare organisations should
undertake planning, and test the preparedness response for the various phases of a pandemic.
This includes:
● An assessment of their facilities’ current capabilities. Healthcare services will not be able
to operate under ‘business as usual’ during a COVID-19 pandemic. An assessment of
the practical ability to deliver care and implement control measures under the pressure
of an exceptional number of patient admissions and reduced staff numbers due to illness
must be assessed; ensuring their facilities’ most current blueprints are readily available
and accessible if needed to make necessary changes;
● An assessment of the current workforce;
● Working in a multidisciplinary team with healthcare and social care leaders/managers,
engineering, and clinical staff to plan for segregation of patients and/or services and
creation of adequate isolation rooms; identifying potential areas that could be converted
effectively with minimum modifications; and
● Defining engineering, administrative, and personnel requirements that can be efficiently
implemented during a pandemic COVID-19 event.8

4. Infection prevention and control
precautions
Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission based precautions (TBPs)
must be used when managing patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
4.1 Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) definition
Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) are the basic infection prevention and control
measures necessary to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious agents from both
recognised and unrecognised sources. Sources include blood and other body fluids, secretions
and excretions (excluding sweat), non-intact skin or mucous membranes, and any equipment or
items in the care environment. SICPs should be used by all staff, in all care settings, at all
times, for all patients.
4.2 Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs) definition
Transmission based precautions (TBPs) are applied when SICPs alone are insufficient to
prevent cross transmission of an infectious agent. TBPs are additional infection control
precautions required when caring for a patient with a known or suspected infectious agent.
TBPs are categorised by the route of transmission of the infectious agent:
4.3 Routes of transmission:
● Contact precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission via direct
contact or indirectly from the immediate care environment (including care equipment).
This is the most common route of infection transmission.
● Droplet precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission over short
distances via droplets (>5μm) from the respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a
mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory
system to above the alveolar level. The maximum distance for cross transmission from
droplets has not been definitively determined, although a distance of approximately
1 metre (3 feet) around the infected individual has frequently been reported in the
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 13 of 49
medical literature as the area of risk.7, 9
● Airborne precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission without
necessarily having close contact via aerosols (≤5μm) from the respiratory tract of one
individual directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Aerosols
penetrate the respiratory system to the alveolar level.
Interrupting transmission of COVID-19 requires both droplet and contact precautions; if an
aerosol generating procedure (AGP) is being undertaken then airborne precautions are
required in addition to contact precautions.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 14 of 49
5. Standard infection control precautions
(SICPs)
5.1 Patient placement/assessment for infection risk
Patients must be promptly assessed for infection risk on arrival at the care area and, if possible,
prior to accepting a patient from another care area. Patients should be continuously reviewed
throughout their inpatient stay. In all healthcare settings, patients with symptoms of COVID-19
should be segregated from non-symptomatic patients as promptly as possible.
5.2 Hand hygiene
Hand hygiene is essential to reduce the transmission of infection in health and other care settings
and is a critical element of standard infection control precautions (SICPs). All staff, patients and
visitors should decontaminate their hands with alcohol based hand rub (ABHR) when entering
and leaving areas where care for –suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients is being
delivered.
Hand hygiene must be performed immediately before every episode of direct patient care and
after any activity or contact that potentially results in hands becoming contaminated, including
the removal of personal protective equipment (PPE), equipment decontamination and waste
handling: https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Your_5_Moments_For_Hand_Hygiene_Poster.pdf
Before performing hand hygiene:
● expose forearms (bare below the elbows);
● remove all hand and wrist jewellery (a single, plain metal finger ring is permitted but
should be removed (or moved up) during hand hygiene);
● ensure finger nails are clean, short and that artificial nails or nail products are not worn;
● cover all cuts or abrasions with a waterproof dressing.
https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Your_5_Moments_For_Hand_Hygiene_Poster.pdf
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 15 of 49
Technique for hand washing and rubbing
● Hand hygiene includes the use of ABHR for routine hand hygiene and hand washing with
soap and water, including thorough drying, if hands are visibly soiled or dirty.
● The technique for hand washing must be carried out thoroughly and for a time period
sufficient to inactivate the virus i.e. 40 to 60 seconds. See Appendix 1 – Best practice
how to hand wash.
● ABHR must be available for all staff as near to point of care as possible, where this is not
practical, personal dispensers should be used. The technique for use of ABHR to
decontaminate hands must be carried out thoroughly and for a time period sufficient to
inactivate the virus i.e. 20 to 30 seconds. See Appendix 2.
● Where no running water is available or hand hygiene facilities are lacking, such as in a
patient’s home, staff may use hand wipes followed by ABHR and should wash their
hands at the first available opportunity.
5.3 Respiratory and cough hygiene – ‘Catch it, bin it, kill it’
Patients, staff and visitors should be encouraged to minimise potential COVID-19 transmission
through good respiratory hygiene measures:
● Disposable, single-use tissues should be used to cover the nose and mouth when
sneezing, coughing or wiping and blowing the nose. Used tissues should be disposed of
promptly in the nearest waste bin.
● Tissues, waste bins (lined and foot operated) and hand hygiene facilities should be
available for patients, visitors and staff.
● Hands should be cleaned (using soap and water if possible, otherwise using ABHR) after
coughing, sneezing, using tissues or after any contact with respiratory secretions and
contaminated objects.
● Encourage patients to keep hands away from the eyes, mouth and nose.
● Some patients (e.g. the elderly and children) may need assistance with containment of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 16 of 49
respiratory secretions; those who are immobile will need a container (e.g. a plastic bag)
readily at hand for immediate disposal of tissues.
● In common waiting areas or during transportation, symptomatic patients may wear a
fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical face mask (FRSM), if tolerated, to minimise the
dispersal of respiratory secretions and reduce environmental contamination.
5.4 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Before undertaking any procedure, staff should assess any likely exposure and ensure PPE is
worn that provides adequate protection against the risks associated with the procedure or task
being undertaken. All staff should be trained in the proper use of all PPE that they may be
required to wear.
In addition:
● Staff who have had and recovered from COVID-19 should continue to follow infection
control precautions, including the PPE recommended in this document.
All PPE should be:
● compliant with the relevant BS/EN standards (European technical standards as adopted
in the UK);
● located close to the point of use;
● stored to prevent contamination in a clean/dry area until required for use (expiry dates
must be adhered to);
● single-use only;
● changed immediately after each patient and/or following completion of a procedure or task;
and
● disposed of after use into the correct waste stream i.e. healthcare/clinical waste (this may
require disposal via orange or yellow bag waste; local guidance will be provided depending
on the impact of the disease)
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 17 of 49
5.4.1 Disposable apron/gown
Disposable plastic aprons must be worn to protect staff uniform or clothes from contamination
when providing direct patient care and during environmental and equipment decontamination.
Fluid-resistant gowns must be worn when a disposable plastic apron provides inadequate cover
of staff uniform or clothes for the procedure/task being performed and when there is a risk of
extensive splashing of blood and/or other body fluids e.g. during aerosol generating procedures
(AGPs). If non fluid-resistant gowns are used, a disposable plastic apron should be worn
underneath.
Disposable aprons and gowns must be changed between patients and immediately after
completion of a procedure/task.
5.4.2 Disposable gloves
Disposable gloves must be worn when providing direct patient care and when exposure to
blood and/or other body fluids is anticipated/likely, including during equipment and
environmental decontamination. Gloves must be changed immediately following the care
episode or the task undertaken.
5.4.3 Eye protection/Face visor
Eye/face protection should be worn when there is a risk of contamination to the eyes from
splashing of secretions (including respiratory secretions), blood, body fluids or excretions. An
individual risk assessment should be carried out prior to/at the time of providing care.
Disposable, single-use, eye/face protection is recommended.
Eye/face protection can be achieved by the use of any one of the following:
● surgical mask with integrated visor;
● full face shield/visor;
● polycarbonate safety spectacles or equivalent;
Regular corrective spectacles are not considered adequate eye protection.
See Appendix 3 for the correct order of donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 18 of 49
5.5 Safe management of linen (laundry)
No special procedures are required; linen is categorised as ‘used’ or ‘infectious’. All linen used
in the direct care of patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 should be managed as
‘infectious’ linen. Linen must be handled, transported and processed in a manner that prevents
exposure to the skin and mucous membranes of staff, contamination of their clothing and the
environment:
Disposable gloves and an apron should be worn when handling infectious linen.
All linen should be handled inside the patient room/cohort area. A laundry receptacle should be
available as close as possible to the point of use for immediate linen deposit.
When handling linen do not:
● rinse, shake or sort linen on removal from beds/trolleys;
● place used/infectious linen on the floor or any other surfaces e.g. a locker/table top;
● re-handle used/infectious linen once bagged;
● overfill laundry receptacles; or
● place inappropriate items in the laundry receptacle e.g. used equipment/needles.
When managing infectious linen:
● place directly into a water-soluble/alginate bag and secure;
● place the water-soluble bag inside a clear polythene bag and secure;
● place the polythene bag into in the appropriately coloured (as per local policy) linen bag
(hamper).
All linen bags/receptacles must be tagged e.g. ward/care area and date. Store all
used/infectious linen in a designated, safe, lockable area whilst awaiting uplift. Organisational
preparedness plans should consider the safe storage of excess linen awaiting collection and for
maintaining supplies of clean linen for patient use.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 19 of 49
5.6 Staff uniforms/clothes
The appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) will protect staff uniform from
contamination in most circumstances. Healthcare facilities should provide changing
rooms/areas where staff can change into uniforms on arrival at work.
Organisations may consider the use of theatre scrubs for staff who do not usually wear a
uniform but who are likely to come into close contact with patients e.g. medical staff.
Healthcare laundry services should be used to launder staff uniforms. If there is no laundry
facility available, then uniforms should be transported home in a disposable plastic bag. This
bag should be disposed of into the household waste stream.
Uniforms should be laundered:
● separately from other household linen;
● in a load not more than half the machine capacity;
● at the maximum temperature the fabric can tolerate, then ironed or tumbled-dried.
NB. It is best practice to change into and out of uniforms at work and not wear them when
travelling; this is based on public perception rather than evidence of an infection risk. This does
not apply to community health workers who are required to travel between patients in the same
uniform.
5.7 Management of blood and body fluid spills
Spillages must be decontaminated in line with local policy. For an example, see Appendix 4.
5.8 Management of healthcare (including clinical) and non-clinical waste
Large volumes of waste may be generated by frequent use of PPE; advice from the local waste
management team should be sought prospectively on how to manage this.
Dispose of all waste as clinical waste.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 20 of 49
Waste from a possible or a confirmed case must be disposed of as Category B waste. The
transport of Category B waste is described in Health Technical Memorandum 07-01: Safe
management of healthcare waste. Disposal of all waste related to possible or confirmed cases
should be classified as infectious clinical waste suitable for alternative treatment, unless the
waste has other properties that would require it to be incinerated.
6. Transmission based precautions (TBPs)
for pandemic COVID-19
In addition to standard infection control precautions (SICPs), droplet precautions should be used
for patients known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19 in all healthcare settings.
● COVID-19 virus is expelled as droplets from the respiratory tract of an infected individual
(e.g. during coughing and sneezing) directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctiva of a
susceptible individual(s) or environmental surface(s).
● Droplets travel only short distances through the air; a distance of at least 1 metre has
been used for deploying droplet precautions.
However, this distance should be
considered as the minimum rather than an absolute:
● Transmission based precautions (TBPs (droplet) should be continued until the resolution
of the patient’s fever and respiratory symptoms.
6.1 Duration of precautions
Patients should remain in isolation/cohort with TBPs applied until the resolution of fever and
respiratory symptoms. The duration of TBPs may require modification based on the intelligence
gathered about COVID-19.
Patients can be discharged before resolution of symptoms provided they are deemed clinically
fit for discharge and should be advised to self-isolate as per staying at home guidance.
Discharge to long term care facilities should be discussed and agreed locally.
The decision to modify the duration of, or ‘stand down’ TBPs should be made by the clinical

team managing the patient(s); based on patient condition and in agreement with the local
Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT).
6.2 Segregation and cohorting (inpatient settings)
6.2.1 Negative pressure isolation rooms
Special environmental controls, such as negative pressure isolation rooms, are not necessary
to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. However, in the early stages, and in high risk
settings, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may be isolated in negative pressure
rooms.
6.2.2 Single rooms
Wherever possible, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed in single
rooms. In an escalating situation there is however likely to be a lack of single rooms/isolation
facilities.
Where single/isolation rooms are in short supply, and cohorting is not yet considered
possible (patient(s) awaiting laboratory confirmation), prioritise patients who have excessive
cough and sputum production for single/isolation room placement.
Single rooms in COVID-19 segregated areas should, wherever possible, be reserved for
performing aerosol generating procedures (AGPs).
Single rooms in non-COVID-19 areas should be reserved for patients requiring isolation for
other (non-influenza-like illness) reasons.
The prioritising of patients for isolation other than suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients
should be decided locally, based on patient need and local resources.
6.2.3 Cohort areas
If a single/isolation room is not available, cohort confirmed respiratory infected patients with
other patients confirmed to have COVID-19. Ensure patients are physically separated; a
distance of at least 1 metre. Use privacy curtains between the beds to minimise opportunities
for close contact. Where possible, a designated self-contained area or wing of the healthcare
facility should be used for the treatment and care of patients with COVID-19. This area should:
● include a reception area that is separate from the rest of the facility and should, if
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 22 of 49
feasible, have a separate entrance/exit from the rest of the building;
● not be used as a thoroughfare by other patients, visitors or staff, including patients being
transferred, staff going for meal breaks, and staff and visitors entering and exiting the
building;
● be separated from non-segregated areas by closed doors; and
● have signage displayed warning of the segregated area to control entry.
Hospitals should consider creating cohort areas which differentiate the level of care required.
It
may also be prudent to consider:
● the need for cohorting in single/mixed sex wards/bays
● underlying patient condition (immunocompromised);
● age groups when cohorting children; and
● routine childhood vaccination status when cohorting children.
6.2.4 Staff cohorting
Assigning a dedicated team of staff to care for patients in isolation/cohort rooms/areas is an
additional infection control measure. This should be implemented whenever there are sufficient
levels of staff available (so as not to have a negative impact on non-affected patients’ care).
Staff who have had confirmed COVID-19 and recovered should continue to follow the infection
control precautions, including personal protective equipment (PPE), as outlined in this
document (see section 7).
6.2.5 Visitors to segregated/cohort areas
Visitors to all areas of the healthcare facility should be restricted to essential visitors only, such
as parents of paediatric patients or an affected patient’s main carer. Local risk assessment and
practical management should be considered, ensuring this is a pragmatic and proportionate
response, including the consideration of whether there is a requirement for visitors to wear PPE
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 23 of 49
or respiratory protective equipment (RPE).
Visiting may be suspended if considered appropriate. All visitors entering a segregated/cohort
area must be instructed on hand hygiene. They must not visit any other care area.
Signage to support restrictions is critical. Visitors with COVID-19 symptoms must not enter the
healthcare facility. Visitors who are symptomatic should be encouraged to leave and must not
be permitted to enter areas where there are immunocompromised patients.
6.3 Patient transfers and transport
6.3.1 Intra-hospital transfers:
● The movement and transport of patients from their single room/cohort area should be
limited to essential purposes only. Staff at the receiving destination must be informed
that the patient has or is suspected to have COVID-19.
● If transport/movement is necessary, consider offering the patient a fluid-resistant (Type
IIR) surgical mask (FRSM) to be worn during transportation, to minimise the dispersal of
respiratory droplets when this can be tolerated.
● Patients must be taken straight to and returned from clinical departments and must not
wait in communal areas. If possible, patients should be placed at the end of clinical lists.
6.3.2 Transfer from primary care/community settings:
● If transfer from a primary care facility or community setting to hospital is required, the
ambulance service should be informed of the infectious status of the patient.
● Staff of the receiving ward/department should be notified in advance of any transfer and
must be informed that the patient has or is suspected to have COVID-19.
6.3.3 Inter-hospital transfers:
● Patient transfer from one healthcare facility to another should be avoided; transfer may
be undertaken if medically necessary for specialist care arising out of complications or
concurrent medical events (for example, cardiac angioplasty, and renal dialysis). If
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 24 of 49
transfer is essential, the ambulance service and receiving hospital must be advised in
advance of the infectious status of the patient.
6.4 Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Personal protective equipment (PPE) for the care of patients with COVID-19 is summarised in
Table 1, see Appendix 3 for how to put on and remove PPE.

6.4.1 Fluid resistant (Type IIR) surgical face masks (FRSM)
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 25 of 49
Fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical masks (FRSMs) are worn to protect the wearer from the
transmission of COVID-19 by respiratory droplets.
In all healthcare settings:
● A FRSM must be worn when working in close contact (within 1 metre) of a patient with
COVID-19 symptoms.
This provides a physical barrier to minimise contamination of the
mucosa of the mouth and nose.
● In an area where pandemic COVID-19 patients have been cohorted together, it may be
more practical for staff to wear a FRSM at all times, rather than only when in close
contact with a patient. Similarly, in primary care/outpatient settings it may be more
practical for staff working in a segregated (COVID-19 patient) area to wear a FRSM for
the duration they are in the patient area.
●
A FRSM for COVID-19 should:
– be well fitted covering both nose and mouth;
– not be allowed to dangle around the neck of the wearer after or between each
use;
– not be touched once put on;
– be changed when they become moist or damaged;
– be removed outside the patient room, cohort area or 1 metre away from the
patient with possible/confirmed COVID-19; and
– be worn once and then discarded as healthcare (clinical) waste (hand
hygiene must always be performed after disposal).
The provision of a FRSM for patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 at point of
assessment or triage in any healthcare setting should be considered if the patient can tolerate it
(except when in a dedicated COVID-19 area).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 26 of 49
6.4.2 Filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirators
Filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirators should be worn whenever there is a risk of
airborne transmission of pandemic COVID-19 i.e. during aerosol generating procedures (AGPs)
and at all times in intensive care unit (ICU), intensive therapy unit (ITU), high dependency unit
(HDU) where COVID-19 patients are cohorted.
All tight fitting respiratory protective equipment (RPE) (i.e. FFP3 respirators) must be:
● single use (disposable) and fluid-resistant*. Fluid resistant FFP3’s should be worn with
appropriate eye protection;
● fit tested on all healthcare staff who may be required to wear an FFP3 respirator to
ensure an adequate seal/fit according to the manufacturers’ guidance; fit checked
(according to the manufacturers’ guidance) every time an FFP3 respirator is donned to
ensure an adequate seal has been achieved;
● compatible with other facial protection used i.e. protective eyewear so that this does not
interfere with the seal of the respiratory protection. Regular corrective spectacles are not
considered adequate eye protection;
● disposed of and replaced if breathing becomes difficult, the respirator is damaged or
distorted, the respirator becomes obviously contaminated by respiratory secretions or
other body fluids, or if a proper face fit cannot be maintained; and
● be worn once and then discarded as healthcare (clinical) waste (hand hygiene
must always be performed after disposal).
*If wearing a FFP3 that is not fluid resistant, a full face shield/ visor must be worn
A FFP3 respirator, although ‘single use’, can be worn for as long as comfortable, for example
for the duration of a ward round or providing clinical care.
Once separated from the face FFP3s must be discarded.
In the absence of an anteroom/lobby remove FFP3 respirators in a safe area (e.g. outside the
isolation/cohort room/area).
All other PPE should be removed in the patient care area.

Page 28 of 49
6.5 Aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs)
Aerosols generated by medical procedures are one route for the transmission of the COVID-19
virus. The following procedures are considered to be potentially infectious AGPs:
● Intubation, extubation and related procedures;
● Tracheotomy/tracheostomy procedures;
● Manual ventilation;
● Open suctioning;
● Bronchoscopy;
● Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) e.g. Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) and
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ventilation (CPAP);
● Surgery and post-mortem procedures in which high-speed devices are used;
● High-frequency oscillating ventilation (HFOV);
● High-flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO)
● Induction of sputum (see glossary);
● Some dental procedures (e.g. high speed drilling).
For patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19, any of these potentially infectious AGPs
should only be carried out when essential. Where possible, these procedures should be carried
out in a single room with the doors shut. Only those healthcare staff who are needed to
undertake the procedure should be present. A disposable, fluid repellant surgical gown, gloves,
eye protection and a FFP3 respirator should be worn by those undertaking the procedure and
those in the room.
Certain other procedures/equipment may generate an aerosol from material other than patient
secretions but are not considered to represent a significant infectious risk. Procedures in this
category include:
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 29 of 49
● administration of pressurised humidified oxygen;
● administration of medication via nebulisation.
Note: During nebulisation, the aerosol derives from a non-patient source (the fluid in the
nebuliser chamber) and does not carry patient-derived viral particles. If a particle in the aerosol
coalesces with a contaminated mucous membrane, it will cease to be airborne and therefore
will not be part of an aerosol. Staff should use appropriate hand hygiene when helping patients
to remove nebulisers and oxygen masks.
6.6 Management of equipment and the care environment
Decontamination of equipment and the care environment must be performed using either:
● A combined detergent/disinfectant solution at a dilution of 1,000 parts per million
available chlorine (ppm available chlorine (av.cl.)); or
● A general purpose neutral detergent in a solution of warm water followed by a
disinfectant solution of 1,000ppm av.cl.
Only cleaning (detergent) and disinfectant products supplied by employers are to be used.
Products must be prepared and used according to the manufacturers’ instructions and
recommended product ""contact times"" must be followed. If alternative cleaning
agents/disinfectants are to be used, they should only on the advice of the IPCT and conform to
EN standard 14476 for virucidal activity
6.6.1 Equipment
Patient care equipment should be single-use items if possible. Reusable (communal) non-
invasive equipment should as far as possible be allocated to the individual patient or cohort of
patients.
Reusable (communal) non-invasive equipment must be decontaminated:
● between each patient and after patient use;
● after blood and body fluid contamination; and
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 30 of 49
● at regular intervals as part of equipment cleaning.
An increased frequency of decontamination should be considered for reusable non-invasive
care equipment when used in isolation/cohort areas.
• ventilators should be protected with a high efficiency filter, such as BS EN 13328-1
• closed system suction should be used
See Appendix 4 for guidance on routine decontamination of reusable non-invasive patient care
equipment.
Avoid the use of fans that re-circulate the air.10
There is no need to use disposable plates or cutlery. Crockery and cutlery can be washed by
hand or in a dishwasher using household detergent and hand-hot water after use.
6.6.2 Environment
Patient isolations rooms, cohort areas and clinical rooms must be decontaminated at least
daily. Clinical rooms should also be decontaminated after clinical sessions for patients with
suspected/known pandemic COVID-19. In addition, patient isolation rooms must be terminally
cleaned:
● Following resolution of symptoms, discharge or transfer (this includes removal and
laundering of all curtains and bed screens);
● Once vacated by staff following an AGP. Clearance of infectious particles after an AGP
is dependent on the mechanical/natural ventilation and air change per hour(ACH) within
the room. A single air change is estimated to remove 63% of airborne contaminants;
after 5 air changes, less than 1% of airborne contamination is thought to remain.
In an
isolation room with 10-12 ACH a minimum of 20 minutes is considered pragmatic; in a
side room with 6 ACH this would be approximately 1 hour. Advice should be sought from
the local Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT).
An increased frequency of decontamination should be incorporated into the environmental
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 31 of 49
decontamination schedules for areas where there may be higher environmental contamination
rates e.g.
● toilets/commodes particularly if patients have diarrhoea; and
● “frequently touched” surfaces such as medical equipment, door/toilet handles and locker
tops, patient call bells, over bed tables and bed rails should be cleaned at least twice
daily and when known to be contaminated with secretions, excretions or body fluids.
Domestic/cleaning staff performing environmental decontamination should:
● be allocated to specific area(s) and not be moved between COVID-19 and non-COVID-
19 care areas;
● be trained in which personal protective equipment (PPE) to use and the correct methods
of wearing, removing and disposing of PPE. The care environment should be kept clean
and clutter free. All non-essential items including toys, books and magazines should be
removed from reception and waiting areas, consulting and treatment rooms, emergency
departments, day rooms and lounges.
When made available, these items should not be
shared. All toys must be cleanable and should be cleaned regularly (preferably at the
same time as the environment).
6.7 Handling dead bodies
The principles of Standard Infection Control Precautions (SICPs) and Transmission Based
Precautions (TBPs) continue to apply whilst deceased individuals remain in the care
environment. This is due to the ongoing risk of infectious transmission via contact although the
risk is usually lower than for living patients. Where the deceased was known or suspected to
have been infected with COVID-19, there is no requirement for a body bag, and viewing,
hygienic preparations, post-mortem and embalming are all permitted.
Following a risk assessment of the potential post-mortem risk pathways PHE has developed
this advice in line with the principles set out in the HSE guidance for droplet transmission risk
as set out in: ‘Managing infection risks when handling the deceased: Guidance for the
mortuary, post-mortem room and funeral premises, and during exhumation’.

Page 32 of 49
7. Occupational health and staff
deployment
Prompt recognition of cases of COVID-19 among healthcare staff is essential to limit the
spread. Healthcare staff with influenza-like illness should not come to work. As a general
principle, healthcare staff who provide care in areas for suspected/confirmed patients should not
care for other patients, although exceptions may be necessary.
A risk assessment is required for health and social care staff at high risk of complications from
COVID-19, including pregnant staff. Employers should:
● Discuss with employees who are at risk or are pregnant the need to be deployed away from
areas used for the care of those who have, or are clinically suspected of having, COVID-19;
or, in the primary care setting, from clinics set up to manage people with COVID-19
symptoms.
● Ensure that advice is available to all healthcare staff, including specific advice to those at
risk from complications.
Bank, agency and locum staff should follow the same deployment advice as permanent staff.
As part of their employer’s duty of care, providers have a role to play in ensuring that a fit
testing programme is in place for those who may need to wear filtering face piece (class 3)
(FFP3) respirator. In the event of a breach in infection control procedures e.g. an incorrectly worn
FFP3 respirator during a potentially infectious aerosol generating procedure (AGP, staff should
be reviewed by occupational health.
Occupational health departments should lead on the implementation of systems to monitor staff
illness and absence.
Where possible, staff who have had confirmed COVID-19 (early in the stages of the outbreak
this would be via virology confirmation, thereafter, this is likely to be as per case definition)
should work in the cohort areas and care for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients. Such
staff should continue to follow the infection control precautions, including personal protective
equipment (PPE), as outlined in this document.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 33 of 49
8. Specific settings
The following guidance is given to assist specific care settings to implement the principles of
standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission based precautions (TBPs)
described in this document, which apply in all care settings.
8.1 Care home settings
Isolation within a care home for a known/suspected infection can be achieved in the persons’
bedroom in most cases. Residents should remain in their bedroom whilst considered infectious
(as described above) and the door should remain closed (if unable to isolate the individual then
this should be documented).
8.2 Primary care
In primary care settings (e.g. General Practitioner (GP) practices) suspected COVID-19
patients should be segregated in place or time from other patients, this may be achieved by:
● Creating a separate area within the facility for care of suspected patients, including
separate waiting and reception areas if possible. The area should be separated from
non-segregated areas by closed doors. To control entry, signage should be displayed
warning of the segregated area.
● Alternatively, suspected patients should be seen at a different time from other patients,
with disinfection of shared areas taking place between different clinics.
● GP practices may make arrangements for distinct COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 clinics.
(Non-essential GP clinics may need to be cancelled to enable this).
● Primary care staff should, wherever possible be allocated to either COVID-19
or
other patients.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 34 of 49
8.3 Outpatient settings
For patients who develop symptoms and have long term health conditions that require
attendance at outpatient settings e.g. hospital day care, options include:
● deferring the procedure and re-scheduling the next appointment;
● transferring the patient to a designated hospital with isolation or cohort facilities;
● introducing physical barriers such as screens in special units to separate patients with
symptoms of COVID-19.
8.4 Dental surgeries
Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 should not be seen for routine dental care. If a dental
emergency is suspected such as severe haemorrhaging or difficulty in breathing the patient
should be seen in a hospital environment.
If emergency dental care is required staff in attendance should be kept to a minimum and must
wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (see table 1) particularly if this involves
high speed drilling section 6.5.
8.5 Home visits
Home visits should continue as long as required to patients without COVID-19. If it becomes
necessary to suspend some home visits, alternative arrangements must be put in place to
maintain contact (e.g. telephone liaison). Health and social care staff performing non-deferrable
essential visits (for example, child protection) to households with suspected/confirmed COVID-
19, should follow the infection control precautions in this document.
8.6 Ambulances
In ambulances, patient segregation can be achieved by:
● designating an ambulance(s) for transfer of patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19
for the duration of each shift;
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 35 of 49
● transporting coughing and sneezing patients on their own whenever possible. However, if
pressure upon the service occurs, two patients with symptoms of COVID-19 may be
transferred together and should wear a fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask (FRSM).
Depending on the stage of the pandemic and an assessment of risk, ambulance staff may be
required to wear respiratory protective equipment (RPE). This will be determined locally.
8.7 Emergency departments and acute assessment units
Emergency departments and acute assessment units may be overwhelmed with patients
seeking care during the peak of a pandemic. Alternative approaches to triage and initial
assessment will be required to:
● rapidly screen and identify those who have symptoms of COVID-19 upon their arrival;
● separate symptomatic patients from others to reduce the risk of transmission; and
● determine as early as possible the type of care patients will require (i.e. see and
discharge or admit for treatment).
8.7.1 Screening and triage
Signage should be displayed prior to and on entry to assessment units instructing patients with
symptoms to inform reception staff immediately on their arrival.
A triage practitioner(s) should be based in the reception to manage patient flow, including
deferral of patients who do not require emergency care.
8.7.2 Reception area
Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 should be triaged to a segregated waiting and
assessment area immediately. Patients should be instructed to stay in this waiting area and not
visit other departments or, parts of the hospital/unit, or go to public areas such as the cafeteria.
Signage and physical barriers should be used as appropriate.
If separate areas for patients with symptoms of COVID-19 cannot be established, an alternative
area/site should be set up for those at highest risk of complications from COVID-19 and who do
not have respiratory symptoms (e.g. patients presenting for dialysis, patients with a history of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 36 of 49
blood cell or organ transplantation, chemotherapy, or who are immunocompromised for other
reasons).
Patients who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 but require prompt acute care assessment
should be triaged to a specific waiting and examination area, physically separate from the
COVID-19 waiting and assessment area.
8.7.3Critical care
PPE must be worn:
• all respiratory equipment must be protected with a high efficiency filter (such as BS EN 13328-
1). This filter must be disposed of after use
• disposable respiratory equipment should be used wherever possible. Re-usable equipment
must, as a minimum, be decontaminated in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
• a closed suctioning system must be used
• ventilator circuits should not be broken unless necessary
• ventilators must be placed on standby when carrying out bagging
8.7.4 Theatres
• theatres must be informed in advance of a patient transfer of a confirmed or possible COVID-
19 positive case
• the patient should be transported directly to the operating theatre and should wear a surgical
mask if it can be tolerated
• the patient should be anaesthetised and recovered in the theatre. Staff should wear protective
clothing but only those at risk of exposure from aerosol generating procedures, i.e during
intubation need to wear FFP3 respirators and full gowns. considerations about the use of
respiratory/anaesthetic equipment are addressed in the critical care section above
• instruments and devices should be decontaminated in the normal manner in accordance with
manufacturers’ advice
• both laryngoscope handle and blade should either be single use or reprocessed in the Sterile
Supply Department. Video laryngoscope blades should be single use and scope/handle
decontaminated as per manufacture instructions.
• the theatre should be cleaned as per local policy for infected cases, paying particular attention
to hand contact points on the anaesthetic machine
• theatres should not be used by staff or patients for 20 minutes after the patient leaves if
conventionally ventilated, or 5 minutes if ultraclean ventilation is used
• possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19 should be placed at the end of the list where feasible

Appendix 7 Glossary
Aerosol-generating procedures
(AGPs)
Certain medical and patient care activities that
can result in the release of airborne particles
(aerosols). AGPs can create a risk of airborne
transmission of infections that are usually only
spread by droplet transmission.
Airborne Transmission
The spread of infection from one person to
another by airborne particles (aerosols)
containing infectious agents.
Airborne particles
Very small particles that may contain
infectious agents. They can remain in the air for
long periods of time and can be carried over
long distances by air currents. Airborne particles
can be released when a person coughs
or sneezes, and during aerosol generating
procedures (AGPs). “Droplet nuclei” are
aerosols formed from the evaporation of larger
droplet particles (see Droplet Transmission).
Aerosols formed from droplet particles in this
way behave as other aerosols.
Airborne precautions Measures used to prevent and control infections
spread without necessarily having close patient
contact via aerosols (less than or equal to 5μm)
from the respiratory tract of one individual
directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae
of another individual. Aerosols can penetrate the
respiratory system to the alveolar level.
BS/EN standards
Mandatory technical specifications created by
either the British Standards Institute (BS) or
European Standardisation Organisations (EN) in
collaboration with government bodies, industry
experts and trade associations. They aim to
ensure the quality and safety of products,
services and systems.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 44 of 49
Cohort area
An area (room, bay, ward) in which two or more
patients (a cohort) with the same confirmed
infection are placed. A cohort area should be
physically separate from other patients.
Contact precautions
Measures used to prevent and control infections
that spread via direct contact with the patient or
indirectly from the patient’s immediate care
environment (including care equipment). This is
the most common route of infection
transmission.
Contact transmission Contact transmission is the most common route
of transmission, and consists of two distinct
types: direct contact and indirect contact. Direct
transmission occurs when microorganisms are
transmitted directly from an infectious individual
to another individual without the involvement of
another contaminated person or object (fomite).
Indirect transmission occurs when
microorganisms are transmitted from an
infectious individual to another individual through
a contaminated object or person (fomite) or
person.
COVID-19 COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory
disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The
disease was discovered in China in December
2019 and has since spread around the world.
Droplet precautions
Measures used to prevent and control infections
spread over short distances (at least 1 metre (3
feet) via droplets (greater than 5μm) from the
respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a
mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another
individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory
system to above the alveolar level.
Droplet transmission
The spread of infection from one person to
another by droplets containing infectious agents.
Eye/Face protection
Worn when there is a risk from splashing of
secretion (including respiratory secretions),
eye/face protection can be achieved by the use
of any one of the following: a surgical mask with
integrated visor; a full face visor/shield; or
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.

polycarbonate safety spectacles or equivalent;
FFP3 Respiratory protection that is worn over the nose
and mouth designed to protect the wearer from
inhaling hazardous substances, including
airborne particles (aerosols). FFP stands for
filtering face piece. There are three categories of
FFP respirator: FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3. An FFP3
respirator provides the highest level of
protection, and is the only category of respirator
legislated for use in UK healthcare settings.
Fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical face
mask (FRSM)
A disposable fluid-resistant mask worn over the
nose and mouth to protect the mucous
membranes of the wearer’s nose and mouth
from splashes and infectious droplets. FRSMs
can also be used to protect patients.
When
recommended for infection control purposes a
'surgical face mask' typically denotes a
fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask.
Fluid-resistant
A term applied to fabrics that resist liquid
penetration, often used interchangeably with
'fluid-repellent' when describing the properties of
protective clothing or equipment.
Frequently touched surfaces
Surfaces of the environment which are
commonly touched/come into contact with
human hands.
High Consequence Infectious Disease
(HCID)
In the UK, a high consequence infectious disease
(HCID) is defined according to the following
criteria: Acute infectious disease; typically has a
high case-fatality rate; may not have effective
prophylaxis or treatment; often difficult to
recognise and detect rapidly; ability to spread in
the community and within healthcare settings; and
requires an enhanced individual, population and
system response to ensure it is managed
effectively, efficiently and safely.
Healthcare/clinical waste Waste produced as a result of healthcare
activities for example soiled dressings, sharps.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.

High risk units
Intensive care units, intensive therapy units and
high dependency units.
Incubation period
The period between the infection of an individual
by a pathogen and the manifestation of the illness
or disease it causes.
Induction of sputum Induction of sputum typically involves the
administration of nebulised saline to moisten and
loosen respiratory secretions (this may be
accompanied by chest physiotherapy (percussion
and vibration)) to induce forceful coughing.
Infectious linen
Linen that has been used by a patient who is
known or suspected to be infectious and/or linen
that is contaminated with blood and/or other body
fluids e.g. faeces.
Long term health condition
Defined as:
• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
bronchitis, emphysema or asthma
• Heart disease
• Kidney disease
• Liver disease
• Stroke or a transient ischaemic attack (TIA)
• Diabetes
• Lowered immunity as a result of disease or
medical treatment, such as steroid
medication or cancer treatment
• Neurological condition, such as
Parkinson's disease, motor neurone
disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), cerebral
palsy, or a learning disability
• Problem with spleen, including sickle cell
disease, or had spleen removed
• A BMI of 40 or above (obese).
Negative pressure isolation room
A room which maintains permanent negative
pressure i.e. air flow is from the outside adjacent
space (e.g. corridor) into the room and then
exhausted to the outdoors.

New and emerging viruses (including
respiratory viruses)
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) defines emerging infectious diseases as:
• New infections resulting from changes in or
evolution of existing organisms.
• Known infections spreading to new
geographical areas or populations.
• Previously unrecognised infections
appearing in areas undergoing ecological
transformation.
• Old infections re-emerging as a result of
antibiotic resistance in known agents or
breakdown in public health measures.
Personal Protective Equipment
(PPE)
Equipment a person wears to protect themselves
from risks to their health or safety, including
exposure to infection agents. The level of PPE
required depends on: Suspected/known infectious
agent; severity of the illness caused; transmission
route of the infectious agent; and the
procedure/task being undertaken.
Respiratory droplets
A small droplet, such as a particle of moisture
released from the mouth during coughing,
sneezing, or speaking.
Respiratory symptoms ‘Respiratory symptoms’ include rhinorrhoea
(runny nose); sore throat; cough; difficulty
breathing or shortness of breath.
Segregation
Physically separating or isolating from other
people.

the virus responsible for the 2003 outbreak of
human coronavirus disease.
SARS-CoV-2 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,
the virus responsible for the 2019 outbreak of
COVID-19 disease.
Standard infection control
precautions (SICPs)
SICPs are the basic infection prevention and
control measures necessary to reduce the risk of
transmission of an infectious agent from both
recognised and unrecognised sources of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.

infection.
Single room
A room with space for one patient and usually
contains as a minimum: a bed; locker/wardrobe;
and a clinical wash-hand basin.
Staff cohorting
When staff care for one specific group of patients
and do not move between different patient

1. Introduction
This document outlines the infection prevention and control advice for healthcare workers
involved in receiving, assessing and caring for patients who are a possible or confirmed case of
COVID-19.
It is based on the best evidence available from previous pandemic and inter-
pandemic periods and focuses on the infection prevention and control aspects of this disease
only, recognising that a preparedness plan will consider other counter measures.
The infection prevention and control advice in this document is considered good practice in
response to this COVID-19 pandemic.
N.B. The emerging evidence base on COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. Further updates may
be made to this guidance as new detail or evidence emerges.
1.1 Scope and purpose
This document provides guidance and information on infection prevention and control
procedures to inform and advise local healthcare planning for COVID-19. This guidance has
been written for the NHS, but the infection prevention and control principles apply to other
settings where healthcare is delivered. It is issued jointly by the Department of Health and
Social Care (DHSC), Public Health Wales (PHW), Public Health Agency (PHA) Northern
Ireland, Health Protection Scotland (HPS) and Public Health England as official guidance.
Whilst this guidance seeks to ensure a consistent and resilient UK wide approach, some
differences in operational details and organisational responsibilities may apply in Northern
Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland.

2. Transmission characteristics of COVID-
19 and principles of infection prevention
and control
2.1 Routes of transmission
Infection control advice is based on the reasonable assumption that the transmission
characteristics of COVID-19 are similar to those of the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak. The initial
phylogenetic and immunologic similarities between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV can be
extrapolated to gain insight into some of the epidemiological characteristics. The transmission
of COVID-19 is thought to occur mainly through respiratory droplets generated by coughing and
sneezing, and through contact with contaminated surfaces.1
The predominant modes of
transmission are assumed to be droplet and contact.
For SARS-CoV, there is limited evidence
from observational studies showing a protective effect of up to 80% of masks and N95
respirators (the US equivalent of UK FFP2 respirators) used by healthcare workers however the
evidence base is sparse and indications (and compliance) for mask/respirator use in these
studies varied.2 It should be noted that N95 respirators are not recommended for use in UK
healthcare settings. In the UK, FFP3 respirators should be worn for airborne precautions and
must be compliant with BS EN149:200.1 For SARS-CoV, evidence suggests that use of both
respirators and surgical face masks offer a similar level of protection, both associated with up to
an 80% reduction in risk of infection.2 During AGPs there is an increased risk of aerosol spread
of infectious agents irrespective of the mode of transmission (contact, droplet, or airborne)
(Section 6.5 AGPs), and airborne precautions must be implemented when performing AGPs,
including those carried out on a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.
In light of the above, the Department of Health and Social Care’s New and Emerging
Respiratory Virus Threat Assessment Group (NERVTAG) have recommended that airborne
precautions should be implemented at all times in clinical areas considered AGP ‘hot spots’ e.g.
Intensive Care Units (ICU), Intensive Therapy Units (ITU) or High Dependency Units (HDU) that
are managing COVID-19 patients (unless patients are isolated in a negative pressure isolation
room/or single room, where only staff entering the room need wear a respirator).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 8 of 49
In other areas a fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask (FRSM) is recommended; all general
ward staff, community, ambulance and social care staff should wear an FRSM for close patient
contact (within 1 metre), unless performing an AGP, when a filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3)
respirator, eye protection, a disposable long sleeved gown and gloves should be worn.
Initial research has identified the presence of live COVID-19 virus in the stools and conjunctival
secretions of confirmed cases.1
All secretions (except sweat) and excretions, including
diarrhoeal stools from patients with known or suspected COVID-19, should be regarded as
potentially infectious.
2.2 Incubation and infectious period
Assessment of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 cases suggests
that, similar to SARS-CoV, patients will not be infectious until the onset of symptoms.
In most
cases, individuals are usually considered infectious while they have symptoms; how infectious
individuals are, depends on the severity of their symptoms and stage of their illness. The median
time from symptom onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately 2 weeks and is 3-6
weeks for severe or critical cases.3
There have been case reports that suggest infectivity
during the asymptomatic period, with one patient found to be shedding virus before the onset of
symptoms.4
Further study is required to determine the actual occurrence and impact of
asymptomatic transmission.
Precautions in section 5: Standard Infection Control Precautions (SICPs) and section 6:
Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs) should remain in place until symptoms resolve.
From international data, the balance of evidence is that infectivity has significantly reduced 7
days after the onset of symptoms.
2.3 Survival in the environment
In light of limited data for SARS-CoV-2, evidence was assessed from studies conducted with
previous human coronaviruses including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Human coronaviruses
can survive on inanimate objects and can remain viable for up to 5 days at temperatures of 22-
25°C and relative humidity of 40-50% (which is typical of air-conditioned indoor environments).1
Survival on environmental surfaces is also dependent on the surface type.1
An experimental
study using a SARS-CoV-2 strain reported viability on plastic for up to 72 hours, for 48 hours on
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 9 of 49
stainless steel and up to 8 hours on copper.1 Viability was quantified by end-point titration on
Vero E6 cells. Extensive environmental contamination may occur following an aerosol
generating procedure (AGP). The rate of clearance of aerosols in an enclosed space is
dependent on the extent of any mechanical/natural ventilation – the greater the number of air
changes per hour (ventilation rate), the sooner any aerosol will be cleared.5 The time required
for clearance of aerosols, and thus the time after which the room can be entered without a
filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirator, can be determined by the number of air changes
per hour (ACH) as outlined in WHO guidance; in general wards and single rooms there should
be a minimum of 6 air changes per hour, in negative-pressure isolation rooms there should be
a minimum of 12 air changes per hour.6 Where feasible, environmental
decontamination
should be performed when it is considered appropriate to enter the room/area without an FFP3
respirator. A single air change is estimated to remove 63% of airborne contaminants, after 5 air
changes less than 1% of airborne contamination is thought to remain.7 A minimum of 20
minutes i.e. 2 air changes, in hospital settings where the majority of these procedures occur is
considered pragmatic.
The precautions described in section 5.2: Hand hygiene and section 6.6: Management of
patient care environment and equipment should be followed.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 10 of 49
3. Organisational preparedness for
preventing and controlling COVID-19
Limiting transmission of COVID-19 in the healthcare setting requires a range of infection
prevention and control measures which can be considered as a hierarchy of controls.
Administrative controls are implemented at an organisational level (e.g. the design and use of
appropriate processes, systems and engineering controls, and provision and use of suitable
work equipment and materials) to help prevent the introduction of infection and to control and
limit the transmission of infection in healthcare. The control of exposure at source, including
adequate ventilation systems and effective environmental decontamination will physically
reduce exposure to infection. Employers are under a legal obligation – under control of
substances hazardous to health (COSHH) – to adequately control the risk of exposure to
hazardous substances where exposure cannot be prevented. The provision and use of personal
protective equipment (PPE), including respiratory protective equipment (RPE), will protect staff,
patients and visitors. Employees have an obligation to make full and proper use of any control
measures, including PPE, provided by their employer. The principles below are listed as a
hierarchy of infection prevention and control measures at a local hospital/ward level. (Note that
this list is not exhaustive but includes key principles and illustrates a useful approach to
preventing and controlling COVID-19).
Hierarchy of Control measures:
● Early recognition/reporting of cases;
● Early assessment/triaging of cases;
● Implementing control measures, including:
– maintaining separation in space and/or time between suspected and confirmed
COVID-19 patients,
– educating staff, patients and visitors about Standard infection control precautions
(SICPs) and Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs),
– prompt implementation of TBPs to limit transmission,
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 11 of 49
– restricting access of ill visitors to the facility,
– instructing staff members with symptoms to stay at home and not come to work until
symptoms resolve,
– planning and implementation of strategies for surge capacity.
In preparedness for implementing these control measures all healthcare organisations should
undertake planning, and test the preparedness response for the various phases of a pandemic.
This includes:
● An assessment of their facilities’ current capabilities. Healthcare services will not be able
to operate under ‘business as usual’ during a COVID-19 pandemic. An assessment of
the practical ability to deliver care and implement control measures under the pressure
of an exceptional number of patient admissions and reduced staff numbers due to illness
must be assessed; ensuring their facilities’ most current blueprints are readily available
and accessible if needed to make necessary changes;
● An assessment of the current workforce;
● Working in a multidisciplinary team with healthcare and social care leaders/managers,
engineering, and clinical staff to plan for segregation of patients and/or services and
creation of adequate isolation rooms; identifying potential areas that could be converted
effectively with minimum modifications; and
● Defining engineering, administrative, and personnel requirements that can be efficiently
implemented during a pandemic COVID-19 event.8

4. Infection prevention and control
precautions
Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission based precautions (TBPs)
must be used when managing patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
4.1 Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) definition
Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) are the basic infection prevention and control
measures necessary to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious agents from both
recognised and unrecognised sources. Sources include blood and other body fluids, secretions
and excretions (excluding sweat), non-intact skin or mucous membranes, and any equipment or
items in the care environment. SICPs should be used by all staff, in all care settings, at all
times, for all patients.
4.2 Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs) definition
Transmission based precautions (TBPs) are applied when SICPs alone are insufficient to
prevent cross transmission of an infectious agent. TBPs are additional infection control
precautions required when caring for a patient with a known or suspected infectious agent.
TBPs are categorised by the route of transmission of the infectious agent:
4.3 Routes of transmission:
● Contact precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission via direct
contact or indirectly from the immediate care environment (including care equipment).
This is the most common route of infection transmission.
● Droplet precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission over short
distances via droplets (>5μm) from the respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a
mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory
system to above the alveolar level. The maximum distance for cross transmission from
droplets has not been definitively determined, although a distance of approximately
1 metre (3 feet) around the infected individual has frequently been reported in the
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 13 of 49
medical literature as the area of risk.7, 9
● Airborne precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission without
necessarily having close contact via aerosols (≤5μm) from the respiratory tract of one
individual directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Aerosols
penetrate the respiratory system to the alveolar level.
Interrupting transmission of COVID-19 requires both droplet and contact precautions; if an
aerosol generating procedure (AGP) is being undertaken then airborne precautions are
required in addition to contact precautions.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 14 of 49
5. Standard infection control precautions
(SICPs)
5.1 Patient placement/assessment for infection risk
Patients must be promptly assessed for infection risk on arrival at the care area and, if possible,
prior to accepting a patient from another care area. Patients should be continuously reviewed
throughout their inpatient stay. In all healthcare settings, patients with symptoms of COVID-19
should be segregated from non-symptomatic patients as promptly as possible.
5.2 Hand hygiene
Hand hygiene is essential to reduce the transmission of infection in health and other care settings
and is a critical element of standard infection control precautions (SICPs). All staff, patients and
visitors should decontaminate their hands with alcohol based hand rub (ABHR) when entering
and leaving areas where care for –suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients is being
delivered.
Hand hygiene must be performed immediately before every episode of direct patient care and
after any activity or contact that potentially results in hands becoming contaminated, including
the removal of personal protective equipment (PPE), equipment decontamination and waste
handling: https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Your_5_Moments_For_Hand_Hygiene_Poster.pdf
Before performing hand hygiene:
● expose forearms (bare below the elbows);
● remove all hand and wrist jewellery (a single, plain metal finger ring is permitted but
should be removed (or moved up) during hand hygiene);
● ensure finger nails are clean, short and that artificial nails or nail products are not worn;
● cover all cuts or abrasions with a waterproof dressing.
https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Your_5_Moments_For_Hand_Hygiene_Poster.pdf
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 15 of 49
Technique for hand washing and rubbing
● Hand hygiene includes the use of ABHR for routine hand hygiene and hand washing with
soap and water, including thorough drying, if hands are visibly soiled or dirty.
● The technique for hand washing must be carried out thoroughly and for a time period
sufficient to inactivate the virus i.e. 40 to 60 seconds. See Appendix 1 – Best practice
how to hand wash.
● ABHR must be available for all staff as near to point of care as possible, where this is not
practical, personal dispensers should be used. The technique for use of ABHR to
decontaminate hands must be carried out thoroughly and for a time period sufficient to
inactivate the virus i.e. 20 to 30 seconds. See Appendix 2.
● Where no running water is available or hand hygiene facilities are lacking, such as in a
patient’s home, staff may use hand wipes followed by ABHR and should wash their
hands at the first available opportunity.
5.3 Respiratory and cough hygiene – ‘Catch it, bin it, kill it’
Patients, staff and visitors should be encouraged to minimise potential COVID-19 transmission
through good respiratory hygiene measures:
● Disposable, single-use tissues should be used to cover the nose and mouth when
sneezing, coughing or wiping and blowing the nose. Used tissues should be disposed of
promptly in the nearest waste bin.
● Tissues, waste bins (lined and foot operated) and hand hygiene facilities should be
available for patients, visitors and staff.
● Hands should be cleaned (using soap and water if possible, otherwise using ABHR) after
coughing, sneezing, using tissues or after any contact with respiratory secretions and
contaminated objects.
● Encourage patients to keep hands away from the eyes, mouth and nose.
● Some patients (e.g. the elderly and children) may need assistance with containment of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 16 of 49
respiratory secretions; those who are immobile will need a container (e.g. a plastic bag)
readily at hand for immediate disposal of tissues.
● In common waiting areas or during transportation, symptomatic patients may wear a
fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical face mask (FRSM), if tolerated, to minimise the
dispersal of respiratory secretions and reduce environmental contamination.
5.4 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Before undertaking any procedure, staff should assess any likely exposure and ensure PPE is
worn that provides adequate protection against the risks associated with the procedure or task
being undertaken. All staff should be trained in the proper use of all PPE that they may be
required to wear.
In addition:
● Staff who have had and recovered from COVID-19 should continue to follow infection
control precautions, including the PPE recommended in this document.
All PPE should be:
● compliant with the relevant BS/EN standards (European technical standards as adopted
in the UK);
● located close to the point of use;
● stored to prevent contamination in a clean/dry area until required for use (expiry dates
must be adhered to);
● single-use only;
● changed immediately after each patient and/or following completion of a procedure or task;
and
● disposed of after use into the correct waste stream i.e. healthcare/clinical waste (this may
require disposal via orange or yellow bag waste; local guidance will be provided depending
on the impact of the disease)
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 17 of 49
5.4.1 Disposable apron/gown
Disposable plastic aprons must be worn to protect staff uniform or clothes from contamination
when providing direct patient care and during environmental and equipment decontamination.
Fluid-resistant gowns must be worn when a disposable plastic apron provides inadequate cover
of staff uniform or clothes for the procedure/task being performed and when there is a risk of
extensive splashing of blood and/or other body fluids e.g. during aerosol generating procedures
(AGPs). If non fluid-resistant gowns are used, a disposable plastic apron should be worn
underneath.
Disposable aprons and gowns must be changed between patients and immediately after
completion of a procedure/task.
5.4.2 Disposable gloves
Disposable gloves must be worn when providing direct patient care and when exposure to
blood and/or other body fluids is anticipated/likely, including during equipment and
environmental decontamination. Gloves must be changed immediately following the care
episode or the task undertaken.
5.4.3 Eye protection/Face visor
Eye/face protection should be worn when there is a risk of contamination to the eyes from
splashing of secretions (including respiratory secretions), blood, body fluids or excretions. An
individual risk assessment should be carried out prior to/at the time of providing care.
Disposable, single-use, eye/face protection is recommended.
Eye/face protection can be achieved by the use of any one of the following:
● surgical mask with integrated visor;
● full face shield/visor;
● polycarbonate safety spectacles or equivalent;
Regular corrective spectacles are not considered adequate eye protection.
See Appendix 3 for the correct order of donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 18 of 49
5.5 Safe management of linen (laundry)
No special procedures are required; linen is categorised as ‘used’ or ‘infectious’. All linen used
in the direct care of patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 should be managed as
‘infectious’ linen. Linen must be handled, transported and processed in a manner that prevents
exposure to the skin and mucous membranes of staff, contamination of their clothing and the
environment:
Disposable gloves and an apron should be worn when handling infectious linen.
All linen should be handled inside the patient room/cohort area. A laundry receptacle should be
available as close as possible to the point of use for immediate linen deposit.
When handling linen do not:
● rinse, shake or sort linen on removal from beds/trolleys;
● place used/infectious linen on the floor or any other surfaces e.g. a locker/table top;
● re-handle used/infectious linen once bagged;
● overfill laundry receptacles; or
● place inappropriate items in the laundry receptacle e.g. used equipment/needles.
When managing infectious linen:
● place directly into a water-soluble/alginate bag and secure;
● place the water-soluble bag inside a clear polythene bag and secure;
● place the polythene bag into in the appropriately coloured (as per local policy) linen bag
(hamper).
All linen bags/receptacles must be tagged e.g. ward/care area and date. Store all
used/infectious linen in a designated, safe, lockable area whilst awaiting uplift. Organisational
preparedness plans should consider the safe storage of excess linen awaiting collection and for
maintaining supplies of clean linen for patient use.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 19 of 49
5.6 Staff uniforms/clothes
The appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) will protect staff uniform from
contamination in most circumstances. Healthcare facilities should provide changing
rooms/areas where staff can change into uniforms on arrival at work.
Organisations may consider the use of theatre scrubs for staff who do not usually wear a
uniform but who are likely to come into close contact with patients e.g. medical staff.
Healthcare laundry services should be used to launder staff uniforms. If there is no laundry
facility available, then uniforms should be transported home in a disposable plastic bag. This
bag should be disposed of into the household waste stream.
Uniforms should be laundered:
● separately from other household linen;
● in a load not more than half the machine capacity;
● at the maximum temperature the fabric can tolerate, then ironed or tumbled-dried.
NB. It is best practice to change into and out of uniforms at work and not wear them when
travelling; this is based on public perception rather than evidence of an infection risk. This does
not apply to community health workers who are required to travel between patients in the same
uniform.
5.7 Management of blood and body fluid spills
Spillages must be decontaminated in line with local policy. For an example, see Appendix 4.
5.8 Management of healthcare (including clinical) and non-clinical waste
Large volumes of waste may be generated by frequent use of PPE; advice from the local waste
management team should be sought prospectively on how to manage this.
Dispose of all waste as clinical waste.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 20 of 49
Waste from a possible or a confirmed case must be disposed of as Category B waste. The
transport of Category B waste is described in Health Technical Memorandum 07-01: Safe
management of healthcare waste. Disposal of all waste related to possible or confirmed cases
should be classified as infectious clinical waste suitable for alternative treatment, unless the
waste has other properties that would require it to be incinerated.
6. Transmission based precautions (TBPs)
for pandemic COVID-19
In addition to standard infection control precautions (SICPs), droplet precautions should be used
for patients known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19 in all healthcare settings.
● COVID-19 virus is expelled as droplets from the respiratory tract of an infected individual
(e.g. during coughing and sneezing) directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctiva of a
susceptible individual(s) or environmental surface(s).
● Droplets travel only short distances through the air; a distance of at least 1 metre has
been used for deploying droplet precautions.
However, this distance should be
considered as the minimum rather than an absolute:
● Transmission based precautions (TBPs (droplet) should be continued until the resolution
of the patient’s fever and respiratory symptoms.
6.1 Duration of precautions
Patients should remain in isolation/cohort with TBPs applied until the resolution of fever and
respiratory symptoms. The duration of TBPs may require modification based on the intelligence
gathered about COVID-19.
Patients can be discharged before resolution of symptoms provided they are deemed clinically
fit for discharge and should be advised to self-isolate as per staying at home guidance.
Discharge to long term care facilities should be discussed and agreed locally.
The decision to modify the duration of, or ‘stand down’ TBPs should be made by the clinical

COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 21 of 49
team managing the patient(s); based on patient condition and in agreement with the local
Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT).
6.2 Segregation and cohorting (inpatient settings)
6.2.1 Negative pressure isolation rooms
Special environmental controls, such as negative pressure isolation rooms, are not necessary
to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. However, in the early stages, and in high risk
settings, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may be isolated in negative pressure
rooms.
6.2.2 Single rooms
Wherever possible, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed in single
rooms. In an escalating situation there is however likely to be a lack of single rooms/isolation
facilities.
Where single/isolation rooms are in short supply, and cohorting is not yet considered
possible (patient(s) awaiting laboratory confirmation), prioritise patients who have excessive
cough and sputum production for single/isolation room placement.
Single rooms in COVID-19 segregated areas should, wherever possible, be reserved for
performing aerosol generating procedures (AGPs).
Single rooms in non-COVID-19 areas should be reserved for patients requiring isolation for
other (non-influenza-like illness) reasons.
The prioritising of patients for isolation other than suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients
should be decided locally, based on patient need and local resources.
6.2.3 Cohort areas
If a single/isolation room is not available, cohort confirmed respiratory infected patients with
other patients confirmed to have COVID-19. Ensure patients are physically separated; a
distance of at least 1 metre. Use privacy curtains between the beds to minimise opportunities
for close contact. Where possible, a designated self-contained area or wing of the healthcare
facility should be used for the treatment and care of patients with COVID-19. This area should:
● include a reception area that is separate from the rest of the facility and should, if
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 22 of 49
feasible, have a separate entrance/exit from the rest of the building;
● not be used as a thoroughfare by other patients, visitors or staff, including patients being
transferred, staff going for meal breaks, and staff and visitors entering and exiting the
building;
● be separated from non-segregated areas by closed doors; and
● have signage displayed warning of the segregated area to control entry.
Hospitals should consider creating cohort areas which differentiate the level of care required.
It
may also be prudent to consider:
● the need for cohorting in single/mixed sex wards/bays
● underlying patient condition (immunocompromised);
● age groups when cohorting children; and
● routine childhood vaccination status when cohorting children.
6.2.4 Staff cohorting
Assigning a dedicated team of staff to care for patients in isolation/cohort rooms/areas is an
additional infection control measure. This should be implemented whenever there are sufficient
levels of staff available (so as not to have a negative impact on non-affected patients’ care).
Staff who have had confirmed COVID-19 and recovered should continue to follow the infection
control precautions, including personal protective equipment (PPE), as outlined in this
document (see section 7).
6.2.5 Visitors to segregated/cohort areas
Visitors to all areas of the healthcare facility should be restricted to essential visitors only, such
as parents of paediatric patients or an affected patient’s main carer. Local risk assessment and
practical management should be considered, ensuring this is a pragmatic and proportionate
response, including the consideration of whether there is a requirement for visitors to wear PPE
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 23 of 49
or respiratory protective equipment (RPE).
Visiting may be suspended if considered appropriate. All visitors entering a segregated/cohort
area must be instructed on hand hygiene. They must not visit any other care area.
Signage to support restrictions is critical. Visitors with COVID-19 symptoms must not enter the
healthcare facility. Visitors who are symptomatic should be encouraged to leave and must not
be permitted to enter areas where there are immunocompromised patients.
6.3 Patient transfers and transport
6.3.1 Intra-hospital transfers:
● The movement and transport of patients from their single room/cohort area should be
limited to essential purposes only. Staff at the receiving destination must be informed
that the patient has or is suspected to have COVID-19.
● If transport/movement is necessary, consider offering the patient a fluid-resistant (Type
IIR) surgical mask (FRSM) to be worn during transportation, to minimise the dispersal of
respiratory droplets when this can be tolerated.
● Patients must be taken straight to and returned from clinical departments and must not
wait in communal areas. If possible, patients should be placed at the end of clinical lists.
6.3.2 Transfer from primary care/community settings:
● If transfer from a primary care facility or community setting to hospital is required, the
ambulance service should be informed of the infectious status of the patient.
● Staff of the receiving ward/department should be notified in advance of any transfer and
must be informed that the patient has or is suspected to have COVID-19.
6.3.3 Inter-hospital transfers:
● Patient transfer from one healthcare facility to another should be avoided; transfer may
be undertaken if medically necessary for specialist care arising out of complications or
concurrent medical events (for example, cardiac angioplasty, and renal dialysis). If
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 24 of 49
transfer is essential, the ambulance service and receiving hospital must be advised in
advance of the infectious status of the patient.
6.4 Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Personal protective equipment (PPE) for the care of patients with COVID-19 is summarised in
Table 1, see Appendix 3 for how to put on and remove PPE.

6.4.1 Fluid resistant (Type IIR) surgical face masks (FRSM)
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 25 of 49
Fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical masks (FRSMs) are worn to protect the wearer from the
transmission of COVID-19 by respiratory droplets.
In all healthcare settings:
● A FRSM must be worn when working in close contact (within 1 metre) of a patient with
COVID-19 symptoms.
This provides a physical barrier to minimise contamination of the
mucosa of the mouth and nose.
● In an area where pandemic COVID-19 patients have been cohorted together, it may be
more practical for staff to wear a FRSM at all times, rather than only when in close
contact with a patient. Similarly, in primary care/outpatient settings it may be more
practical for staff working in a segregated (COVID-19 patient) area to wear a FRSM for
the duration they are in the patient area.
●
A FRSM for COVID-19 should:
– be well fitted covering both nose and mouth;
– not be allowed to dangle around the neck of the wearer after or between each
use;
– not be touched once put on;
– be changed when they become moist or damaged;
– be removed outside the patient room, cohort area or 1 metre away from the
patient with possible/confirmed COVID-19; and
– be worn once and then discarded as healthcare (clinical) waste (hand
hygiene must always be performed after disposal).
The provision of a FRSM for patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 at point of
assessment or triage in any healthcare setting should be considered if the patient can tolerate it
(except when in a dedicated COVID-19 area).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 26 of 49
6.4.2 Filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirators
Filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirators should be worn whenever there is a risk of
airborne transmission of pandemic COVID-19 i.e. during aerosol generating procedures (AGPs)
and at all times in intensive care unit (ICU), intensive therapy unit (ITU), high dependency unit
(HDU) where COVID-19 patients are cohorted.
All tight fitting respiratory protective equipment (RPE) (i.e. FFP3 respirators) must be:
● single use (disposable) and fluid-resistant*. Fluid resistant FFP3’s should be worn with
appropriate eye protection;
● fit tested on all healthcare staff who may be required to wear an FFP3 respirator to
ensure an adequate seal/fit according to the manufacturers’ guidance; fit checked
(according to the manufacturers’ guidance) every time an FFP3 respirator is donned to
ensure an adequate seal has been achieved;
● compatible with other facial protection used i.e. protective eyewear so that this does not
interfere with the seal of the respiratory protection. Regular corrective spectacles are not
considered adequate eye protection;
● disposed of and replaced if breathing becomes difficult, the respirator is damaged or
distorted, the respirator becomes obviously contaminated by respiratory secretions or
other body fluids, or if a proper face fit cannot be maintained; and
● be worn once and then discarded as healthcare (clinical) waste (hand hygiene
must always be performed after disposal).
*If wearing a FFP3 that is not fluid resistant, a full face shield/ visor must be worn
A FFP3 respirator, although ‘single use’, can be worn for as long as comfortable, for example
for the duration of a ward round or providing clinical care.
Once separated from the face FFP3s must be discarded.
In the absence of an anteroom/lobby remove FFP3 respirators in a safe area (e.g. outside the
isolation/cohort room/area).
All other PPE should be removed in the patient care area.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.

and Safety Executive website.

Page 28 of 49
6.5 Aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs)
Aerosols generated by medical procedures are one route for the transmission of the COVID-19
virus. The following procedures are considered to be potentially infectious AGPs:
● Intubation, extubation and related procedures;
● Tracheotomy/tracheostomy procedures;
● Manual ventilation;
● Open suctioning;
● Bronchoscopy;
● Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) e.g. Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) and
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ventilation (CPAP);
● Surgery and post-mortem procedures in which high-speed devices are used;
● High-frequency oscillating ventilation (HFOV);
● High-flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO)
● Induction of sputum (see glossary);
● Some dental procedures (e.g. high speed drilling).
For patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19, any of these potentially infectious AGPs
should only be carried out when essential. Where possible, these procedures should be carried
out in a single room with the doors shut. Only those healthcare staff who are needed to
undertake the procedure should be present. A disposable, fluid repellant surgical gown, gloves,
eye protection and a FFP3 respirator should be worn by those undertaking the procedure and
those in the room.
Certain other procedures/equipment may generate an aerosol from material other than patient
secretions but are not considered to represent a significant infectious risk. Procedures in this
category include:
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 29 of 49
● administration of pressurised humidified oxygen;
● administration of medication via nebulisation.
Note: During nebulisation, the aerosol derives from a non-patient source (the fluid in the
nebuliser chamber) and does not carry patient-derived viral particles. If a particle in the aerosol
coalesces with a contaminated mucous membrane, it will cease to be airborne and therefore
will not be part of an aerosol. Staff should use appropriate hand hygiene when helping patients
to remove nebulisers and oxygen masks.
6.6 Management of equipment and the care environment
Decontamination of equipment and the care environment must be performed using either:
● A combined detergent/disinfectant solution at a dilution of 1,000 parts per million
available chlorine (ppm available chlorine (av.cl.)); or
● A general purpose neutral detergent in a solution of warm water followed by a
disinfectant solution of 1,000ppm av.cl.
Only cleaning (detergent) and disinfectant products supplied by employers are to be used.
Products must be prepared and used according to the manufacturers’ instructions and
recommended product ""contact times"" must be followed. If alternative cleaning
agents/disinfectants are to be used, they should only on the advice of the IPCT and conform to
EN standard 14476 for virucidal activity
6.6.1 Equipment
Patient care equipment should be single-use items if possible. Reusable (communal) non-
invasive equipment should as far as possible be allocated to the individual patient or cohort of
patients.
Reusable (communal) non-invasive equipment must be decontaminated:
● between each patient and after patient use;
● after blood and body fluid contamination; and
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 30 of 49
● at regular intervals as part of equipment cleaning.
An increased frequency of decontamination should be considered for reusable non-invasive
care equipment when used in isolation/cohort areas.
• ventilators should be protected with a high efficiency filter, such as BS EN 13328-1
• closed system suction should be used
See Appendix 4 for guidance on routine decontamination of reusable non-invasive patient care
equipment.
Avoid the use of fans that re-circulate the air.10
There is no need to use disposable plates or cutlery. Crockery and cutlery can be washed by
hand or in a dishwasher using household detergent and hand-hot water after use.
6.6.2 Environment
Patient isolations rooms, cohort areas and clinical rooms must be decontaminated at least
daily. Clinical rooms should also be decontaminated after clinical sessions for patients with
suspected/known pandemic COVID-19. In addition, patient isolation rooms must be terminally
cleaned:
● Following resolution of symptoms, discharge or transfer (this includes removal and
laundering of all curtains and bed screens);
● Once vacated by staff following an AGP. Clearance of infectious particles after an AGP
is dependent on the mechanical/natural ventilation and air change per hour(ACH) within
the room. A single air change is estimated to remove 63% of airborne contaminants;
after 5 air changes, less than 1% of airborne contamination is thought to remain.
In an
isolation room with 10-12 ACH a minimum of 20 minutes is considered pragmatic; in a
side room with 6 ACH this would be approximately 1 hour. Advice should be sought from
the local Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT).
An increased frequency of decontamination should be incorporated into the environmental
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 31 of 49
decontamination schedules for areas where there may be higher environmental contamination
rates e.g.
● toilets/commodes particularly if patients have diarrhoea; and
● “frequently touched” surfaces such as medical equipment, door/toilet handles and locker
tops, patient call bells, over bed tables and bed rails should be cleaned at least twice
daily and when known to be contaminated with secretions, excretions or body fluids.
Domestic/cleaning staff performing environmental decontamination should:
● be allocated to specific area(s) and not be moved between COVID-19 and non-COVID-
19 care areas;
● be trained in which personal protective equipment (PPE) to use and the correct methods
of wearing, removing and disposing of PPE. The care environment should be kept clean
and clutter free. All non-essential items including toys, books and magazines should be
removed from reception and waiting areas, consulting and treatment rooms, emergency
departments, day rooms and lounges.
When made available, these items should not be
shared. All toys must be cleanable and should be cleaned regularly (preferably at the
same time as the environment).
6.7 Handling dead bodies
The principles of Standard Infection Control Precautions (SICPs) and Transmission Based
Precautions (TBPs) continue to apply whilst deceased individuals remain in the care
environment. This is due to the ongoing risk of infectious transmission via contact although the
risk is usually lower than for living patients. Where the deceased was known or suspected to
have been infected with COVID-19, there is no requirement for a body bag, and viewing,
hygienic preparations, post-mortem and embalming are all permitted.
Following a risk assessment of the potential post-mortem risk pathways PHE has developed
this advice in line with the principles set out in the HSE guidance for droplet transmission risk
as set out in: ‘Managing infection risks when handling the deceased: Guidance for the
mortuary, post-mortem room and funeral premises, and during exhumation’.

COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 32 of 49
7. Occupational health and staff
deployment
Prompt recognition of cases of COVID-19 among healthcare staff is essential to limit the
spread. Healthcare staff with influenza-like illness should not come to work. As a general
principle, healthcare staff who provide care in areas for suspected/confirmed patients should not
care for other patients, although exceptions may be necessary.
A risk assessment is required for health and social care staff at high risk of complications from
COVID-19, including pregnant staff. Employers should:
● Discuss with employees who are at risk or are pregnant the need to be deployed away from
areas used for the care of those who have, or are clinically suspected of having, COVID-19;
or, in the primary care setting, from clinics set up to manage people with COVID-19
symptoms.
● Ensure that advice is available to all healthcare staff, including specific advice to those at
risk from complications.
Bank, agency and locum staff should follow the same deployment advice as permanent staff.
As part of their employer’s duty of care, providers have a role to play in ensuring that a fit
testing programme is in place for those who may need to wear filtering face piece (class 3)
(FFP3) respirator. In the event of a breach in infection control procedures e.g. an incorrectly worn
FFP3 respirator during a potentially infectious aerosol generating procedure (AGP, staff should
be reviewed by occupational health.
Occupational health departments should lead on the implementation of systems to monitor staff
illness and absence.
Where possible, staff who have had confirmed COVID-19 (early in the stages of the outbreak
this would be via virology confirmation, thereafter, this is likely to be as per case definition)
should work in the cohort areas and care for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients. Such
staff should continue to follow the infection control precautions, including personal protective
equipment (PPE), as outlined in this document.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 33 of 49
8. Specific settings
The following guidance is given to assist specific care settings to implement the principles of
standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission based precautions (TBPs)
described in this document, which apply in all care settings.
8.1 Care home settings
Isolation within a care home for a known/suspected infection can be achieved in the persons’
bedroom in most cases. Residents should remain in their bedroom whilst considered infectious
(as described above) and the door should remain closed (if unable to isolate the individual then
this should be documented).
8.2 Primary care
In primary care settings (e.g. General Practitioner (GP) practices) suspected COVID-19
patients should be segregated in place or time from other patients, this may be achieved by:
● Creating a separate area within the facility for care of suspected patients, including
separate waiting and reception areas if possible. The area should be separated from
non-segregated areas by closed doors. To control entry, signage should be displayed
warning of the segregated area.
● Alternatively, suspected patients should be seen at a different time from other patients,
with disinfection of shared areas taking place between different clinics.
● GP practices may make arrangements for distinct COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 clinics.
(Non-essential GP clinics may need to be cancelled to enable this).
● Primary care staff should, wherever possible be allocated to either COVID-19
or
other patients.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 34 of 49
8.3 Outpatient settings
For patients who develop symptoms and have long term health conditions that require
attendance at outpatient settings e.g. hospital day care, options include:
● deferring the procedure and re-scheduling the next appointment;
● transferring the patient to a designated hospital with isolation or cohort facilities;
● introducing physical barriers such as screens in special units to separate patients with
symptoms of COVID-19.
8.4 Dental surgeries
Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 should not be seen for routine dental care. If a dental
emergency is suspected such as severe haemorrhaging or difficulty in breathing the patient
should be seen in a hospital environment.
If emergency dental care is required staff in attendance should be kept to a minimum and must
wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (see table 1) particularly if this involves
high speed drilling section 6.5.
8.5 Home visits
Home visits should continue as long as required to patients without COVID-19. If it becomes
necessary to suspend some home visits, alternative arrangements must be put in place to
maintain contact (e.g. telephone liaison). Health and social care staff performing non-deferrable
essential visits (for example, child protection) to households with suspected/confirmed COVID-
19, should follow the infection control precautions in this document.
8.6 Ambulances
In ambulances, patient segregation can be achieved by:
● designating an ambulance(s) for transfer of patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19
for the duration of each shift;
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 35 of 49
● transporting coughing and sneezing patients on their own whenever possible. However, if
pressure upon the service occurs, two patients with symptoms of COVID-19 may be
transferred together and should wear a fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask (FRSM).
Depending on the stage of the pandemic and an assessment of risk, ambulance staff may be
required to wear respiratory protective equipment (RPE). This will be determined locally.
8.7 Emergency departments and acute assessment units
Emergency departments and acute assessment units may be overwhelmed with patients
seeking care during the peak of a pandemic. Alternative approaches to triage and initial
assessment will be required to:
● rapidly screen and identify those who have symptoms of COVID-19 upon their arrival;
● separate symptomatic patients from others to reduce the risk of transmission; and
● determine as early as possible the type of care patients will require (i.e. see and
discharge or admit for treatment).
8.7.1 Screening and triage
Signage should be displayed prior to and on entry to assessment units instructing patients with
symptoms to inform reception staff immediately on their arrival.
A triage practitioner(s) should be based in the reception to manage patient flow, including
deferral of patients who do not require emergency care.
8.7.2 Reception area
Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 should be triaged to a segregated waiting and
assessment area immediately. Patients should be instructed to stay in this waiting area and not
visit other departments or, parts of the hospital/unit, or go to public areas such as the cafeteria.
Signage and physical barriers should be used as appropriate.
If separate areas for patients with symptoms of COVID-19 cannot be established, an alternative
area/site should be set up for those at highest risk of complications from COVID-19 and who do
not have respiratory symptoms (e.g. patients presenting for dialysis, patients with a history of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 36 of 49
blood cell or organ transplantation, chemotherapy, or who are immunocompromised for other
reasons).
Patients who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 but require prompt acute care assessment
should be triaged to a specific waiting and examination area, physically separate from the
COVID-19 waiting and assessment area.
8.7.3Critical care
PPE must be worn:
• all respiratory equipment must be protected with a high efficiency filter (such as BS EN 13328-
1). This filter must be disposed of after use
• disposable respiratory equipment should be used wherever possible. Re-usable equipment
must, as a minimum, be decontaminated in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
• a closed suctioning system must be used
• ventilator circuits should not be broken unless necessary
• ventilators must be placed on standby when carrying out bagging
8.7.4 Theatres
• theatres must be informed in advance of a patient transfer of a confirmed or possible COVID-
19 positive case
• the patient should be transported directly to the operating theatre and should wear a surgical
mask if it can be tolerated
• the patient should be anaesthetised and recovered in the theatre. Staff should wear protective
clothing but only those at risk of exposure from aerosol generating procedures, i.e during
intubation need to wear FFP3 respirators and full gowns. considerations about the use of
respiratory/anaesthetic equipment are addressed in the critical care section above
• instruments and devices should be decontaminated in the normal manner in accordance with
manufacturers’ advice
• both laryngoscope handle and blade should either be single use or reprocessed in the Sterile
Supply Department. Video laryngoscope blades should be single use and scope/handle
decontaminated as per manufacture instructions.
• the theatre should be cleaned as per local policy for infected cases, paying particular attention
to hand contact points on the anaesthetic machine
• theatres should not be used by staff or patients for 20 minutes after the patient leaves if
conventionally ventilated, or 5 minutes if ultraclean ventilation is used
• possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19 should be placed at the end of the list where feasible

Appendix 7 Glossary
Aerosol-generating procedures
(AGPs)
Certain medical and patient care activities that
can result in the release of airborne particles
(aerosols). AGPs can create a risk of airborne
transmission of infections that are usually only
spread by droplet transmission.
Airborne Transmission
The spread of infection from one person to
another by airborne particles (aerosols)
containing infectious agents.
Airborne particles
Very small particles that may contain
infectious agents. They can remain in the air for
long periods of time and can be carried over
long distances by air currents. Airborne particles
can be released when a person coughs
or sneezes, and during aerosol generating
procedures (AGPs). “Droplet nuclei” are
aerosols formed from the evaporation of larger
droplet particles (see Droplet Transmission).
Aerosols formed from droplet particles in this
way behave as other aerosols.
Airborne precautions Measures used to prevent and control infections
spread without necessarily having close patient
contact via aerosols (less than or equal to 5μm)
from the respiratory tract of one individual
directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae
of another individual. Aerosols can penetrate the
respiratory system to the alveolar level.
BS/EN standards
Mandatory technical specifications created by
either the British Standards Institute (BS) or
European Standardisation Organisations (EN) in
collaboration with government bodies, industry
experts and trade associations. They aim to
ensure the quality and safety of products,
services and systems.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 44 of 49
Cohort area
An area (room, bay, ward) in which two or more
patients (a cohort) with the same confirmed
infection are placed. A cohort area should be
physically separate from other patients.
Contact precautions
Measures used to prevent and control infections
that spread via direct contact with the patient or
indirectly from the patient’s immediate care
environment (including care equipment). This is
the most common route of infection
transmission.
Contact transmission Contact transmission is the most common route
of transmission, and consists of two distinct
types: direct contact and indirect contact. Direct
transmission occurs when microorganisms are
transmitted directly from an infectious individual
to another individual without the involvement of
another contaminated person or object (fomite).
Indirect transmission occurs when
microorganisms are transmitted from an
infectious individual to another individual through
a contaminated object or person (fomite) or
person.
COVID-19 COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory
disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The
disease was discovered in China in December
2019 and has since spread around the world.
Droplet precautions
Measures used to prevent and control infections
spread over short distances (at least 1 metre (3
feet) via droplets (greater than 5μm) from the
respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a
mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another
individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory
system to above the alveolar level.
Droplet transmission
The spread of infection from one person to
another by droplets containing infectious agents.
Eye/Face protection
Worn when there is a risk from splashing of
secretion (including respiratory secretions),
eye/face protection can be achieved by the use
of any one of the following: a surgical mask with
integrated visor; a full face visor/shield; or
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 45 of 49
polycarbonate safety spectacles or equivalent;
FFP3 Respiratory protection that is worn over the nose
and mouth designed to protect the wearer from
inhaling hazardous substances, including
airborne particles (aerosols). FFP stands for
filtering face piece. There are three categories of
FFP respirator: FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3. An FFP3
respirator provides the highest level of
protection, and is the only category of respirator
legislated for use in UK healthcare settings.
Fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical face
mask (FRSM)
A disposable fluid-resistant mask worn over the
nose and mouth to protect the mucous
membranes of the wearer’s nose and mouth
from splashes and infectious droplets. FRSMs
can also be used to protect patients.
When
recommended for infection control purposes a
'surgical face mask' typically denotes a
fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask.
Fluid-resistant
A term applied to fabrics that resist liquid
penetration, often used interchangeably with
'fluid-repellent' when describing the properties of
protective clothing or equipment.
Frequently touched surfaces
Surfaces of the environment which are
commonly touched/come into contact with
human hands.
High Consequence Infectious Disease
(HCID)
In the UK, a high consequence infectious disease
(HCID) is defined according to the following
criteria: Acute infectious disease; typically has a
high case-fatality rate; may not have effective
prophylaxis or treatment; often difficult to
recognise and detect rapidly; ability to spread in
the community and within healthcare settings; and
requires an enhanced individual, population and
system response to ensure it is managed
effectively, efficiently and safely.
Healthcare/clinical waste Waste produced as a result of healthcare
activities for example soiled dressings, sharps.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 46 of 49
High risk units
Intensive care units, intensive therapy units and
high dependency units.
Incubation period
The period between the infection of an individual
by a pathogen and the manifestation of the illness
or disease it causes.
Induction of sputum Induction of sputum typically involves the
administration of nebulised saline to moisten and
loosen respiratory secretions (this may be
accompanied by chest physiotherapy (percussion
and vibration)) to induce forceful coughing.
Infectious linen
Linen that has been used by a patient who is
known or suspected to be infectious and/or linen
that is contaminated with blood and/or other body
fluids e.g. faeces.
Long term health condition
Defined as:
• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
bronchitis, emphysema or asthma
• Heart disease
• Kidney disease
• Liver disease
• Stroke or a transient ischaemic attack (TIA)
• Diabetes
• Lowered immunity as a result of disease or
medical treatment, such as steroid
medication or cancer treatment
• Neurological condition, such as
Parkinson's disease, motor neurone
disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), cerebral
palsy, or a learning disability
• Problem with spleen, including sickle cell
disease, or had spleen removed
• A BMI of 40 or above (obese).
Negative pressure isolation room
A room which maintains permanent negative
pressure i.e. air flow is from the outside adjacent
space (e.g. corridor) into the room and then
exhausted to the outdoors.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 47 of 49
New and emerging viruses (including
respiratory viruses)
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) defines emerging infectious diseases as:
• New infections resulting from changes in or
evolution of existing organisms.
• Known infections spreading to new
geographical areas or populations.
• Previously unrecognised infections
appearing in areas undergoing ecological
transformation.
• Old infections re-emerging as a result of
antibiotic resistance in known agents or
breakdown in public health measures.
Personal Protective Equipment
(PPE)
Equipment a person wears to protect themselves
from risks to their health or safety, including
exposure to infection agents. The level of PPE
required depends on: Suspected/known infectious
agent; severity of the illness caused; transmission
route of the infectious agent; and the
procedure/task being undertaken.
Respiratory droplets
A small droplet, such as a particle of moisture
released from the mouth during coughing,
sneezing, or speaking.
Respiratory symptoms ‘Respiratory symptoms’ include rhinorrhoea
(runny nose); sore throat; cough; difficulty
breathing or shortness of breath.
Segregation
Physically separating or isolating from other
people.
SARS-CoV Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,
the virus responsible for the 2003 outbreak of
human coronavirus disease.
SARS-CoV-2 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,
the virus responsible for the 2019 outbreak of
COVID-19 disease.
Standard infection control
precautions (SICPs)
SICPs are the basic infection prevention and
control measures necessary to reduce the risk of
transmission of an infectious agent from both
recognised and unrecognised sources of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 48 of 49
infection.
Single room
A room with space for one patient and usually
contains as a minimum: a bed; locker/wardrobe;
and a clinical wash-hand basin.
Staff cohorting
When staff care for one specific group of patients
and do not move between different patient
cohorts. Patient cohorts may include for example
‘symptomatic’, ‘asymptomatic and exposed’, or
‘asymptomatic and unexposed’ patient groups.
Transmission based precautions
Additional precautions to be used in addition to
SICPs when caring for patients with a known or
suspected infection or colonisation.

1. Introduction
This document outlines the infection prevention and control advice for healthcare workers
involved in receiving, assessing and caring for patients who are a possible or confirmed case of
COVID-19.
It is based on the best evidence available from previous pandemic and inter-
pandemic periods and focuses on the infection prevention and control aspects of this disease
only, recognising that a preparedness plan will consider other counter measures.
The infection prevention and control advice in this document is considered good practice in
response to this COVID-19 pandemic.
N.B. The emerging evidence base on COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. Further updates may
be made to this guidance as new detail or evidence emerges.
1.1 Scope and purpose
This document provides guidance and information on infection prevention and control
procedures to inform and advise local healthcare planning for COVID-19. This guidance has
been written for the NHS, but the infection prevention and control principles apply to other
settings where healthcare is delivered. It is issued jointly by the Department of Health and
Social Care (DHSC), Public Health Wales (PHW), Public Health Agency (PHA) Northern
Ireland, Health Protection Scotland (HPS) and Public Health England as official guidance.
Whilst this guidance seeks to ensure a consistent and resilient UK wide approach, some
differences in operational details and organisational responsibilities may apply in Northern
Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland.

2. Transmission characteristics of COVID-
19 and principles of infection prevention
and control
2.1 Routes of transmission
Infection control advice is based on the reasonable assumption that the transmission
characteristics of COVID-19 are similar to those of the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak. The initial
phylogenetic and immunologic similarities between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV can be
extrapolated to gain insight into some of the epidemiological characteristics. The transmission
of COVID-19 is thought to occur mainly through respiratory droplets generated by coughing and
sneezing, and through contact with contaminated surfaces.1
The predominant modes of
transmission are assumed to be droplet and contact.
For SARS-CoV, there is limited evidence
from observational studies showing a protective effect of up to 80% of masks and N95
respirators (the US equivalent of UK FFP2 respirators) used by healthcare workers however the
evidence base is sparse and indications (and compliance) for mask/respirator use in these
studies varied.2 It should be noted that N95 respirators are not recommended for use in UK
healthcare settings. In the UK, FFP3 respirators should be worn for airborne precautions and
must be compliant with BS EN149:200.1 For SARS-CoV, evidence suggests that use of both
respirators and surgical face masks offer a similar level of protection, both associated with up to
an 80% reduction in risk of infection.2 During AGPs there is an increased risk of aerosol spread
of infectious agents irrespective of the mode of transmission (contact, droplet, or airborne)
(Section 6.5 AGPs), and airborne precautions must be implemented when performing AGPs,
including those carried out on a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.
In light of the above, the Department of Health and Social Care’s New and Emerging
Respiratory Virus Threat Assessment Group (NERVTAG) have recommended that airborne
precautions should be implemented at all times in clinical areas considered AGP ‘hot spots’ e.g.
Intensive Care Units (ICU), Intensive Therapy Units (ITU) or High Dependency Units (HDU) that
are managing COVID-19 patients (unless patients are isolated in a negative pressure isolation
room/or single room, where only staff entering the room need wear a respirator).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 8 of 49
In other areas a fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask (FRSM) is recommended; all general
ward staff, community, ambulance and social care staff should wear an FRSM for close patient
contact (within 1 metre), unless performing an AGP, when a filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3)
respirator, eye protection, a disposable long sleeved gown and gloves should be worn.
Initial research has identified the presence of live COVID-19 virus in the stools and conjunctival
secretions of confirmed cases.1
All secretions (except sweat) and excretions, including
diarrhoeal stools from patients with known or suspected COVID-19, should be regarded as
potentially infectious.
2.2 Incubation and infectious period
Assessment of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 cases suggests
that, similar to SARS-CoV, patients will not be infectious until the onset of symptoms.
In most
cases, individuals are usually considered infectious while they have symptoms; how infectious
individuals are, depends on the severity of their symptoms and stage of their illness. The median
time from symptom onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately 2 weeks and is 3-6
weeks for severe or critical cases.3
There have been case reports that suggest infectivity
during the asymptomatic period, with one patient found to be shedding virus before the onset of
symptoms.4
Further study is required to determine the actual occurrence and impact of
asymptomatic transmission.
Precautions in section 5: Standard Infection Control Precautions (SICPs) and section 6:
Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs) should remain in place until symptoms resolve.
From international data, the balance of evidence is that infectivity has significantly reduced 7
days after the onset of symptoms.
2.3 Survival in the environment
In light of limited data for SARS-CoV-2, evidence was assessed from studies conducted with
previous human coronaviruses including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Human coronaviruses
can survive on inanimate objects and can remain viable for up to 5 days at temperatures of 22-
25°C and relative humidity of 40-50% (which is typical of air-conditioned indoor environments).1
Survival on environmental surfaces is also dependent on the surface type.1
An experimental
study using a SARS-CoV-2 strain reported viability on plastic for up to 72 hours, for 48 hours on
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 9 of 49
stainless steel and up to 8 hours on copper.1 Viability was quantified by end-point titration on
Vero E6 cells. Extensive environmental contamination may occur following an aerosol
generating procedure (AGP). The rate of clearance of aerosols in an enclosed space is
dependent on the extent of any mechanical/natural ventilation – the greater the number of air
changes per hour (ventilation rate), the sooner any aerosol will be cleared.5 The time required
for clearance of aerosols, and thus the time after which the room can be entered without a
filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirator, can be determined by the number of air changes
per hour (ACH) as outlined in WHO guidance; in general wards and single rooms there should
be a minimum of 6 air changes per hour, in negative-pressure isolation rooms there should be
a minimum of 12 air changes per hour.6 Where feasible, environmental
decontamination
should be performed when it is considered appropriate to enter the room/area without an FFP3
respirator. A single air change is estimated to remove 63% of airborne contaminants, after 5 air
changes less than 1% of airborne contamination is thought to remain.7 A minimum of 20
minutes i.e. 2 air changes, in hospital settings where the majority of these procedures occur is
considered pragmatic.
The precautions described in section 5.2: Hand hygiene and section 6.6: Management of
patient care environment and equipment should be followed.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 10 of 49
3. Organisational preparedness for
preventing and controlling COVID-19
Limiting transmission of COVID-19 in the healthcare setting requires a range of infection
prevention and control measures which can be considered as a hierarchy of controls.
Administrative controls are implemented at an organisational level (e.g. the design and use of
appropriate processes, systems and engineering controls, and provision and use of suitable
work equipment and materials) to help prevent the introduction of infection and to control and
limit the transmission of infection in healthcare. The control of exposure at source, including
adequate ventilation systems and effective environmental decontamination will physically
reduce exposure to infection. Employers are under a legal obligation – under control of
substances hazardous to health (COSHH) – to adequately control the risk of exposure to
hazardous substances where exposure cannot be prevented. The provision and use of personal
protective equipment (PPE), including respiratory protective equipment (RPE), will protect staff,
patients and visitors. Employees have an obligation to make full and proper use of any control
measures, including PPE, provided by their employer. The principles below are listed as a
hierarchy of infection prevention and control measures at a local hospital/ward level. (Note that
this list is not exhaustive but includes key principles and illustrates a useful approach to
preventing and controlling COVID-19).
Hierarchy of Control measures:
● Early recognition/reporting of cases;
● Early assessment/triaging of cases;
● Implementing control measures, including:
– maintaining separation in space and/or time between suspected and confirmed
COVID-19 patients,
– educating staff, patients and visitors about Standard infection control precautions
(SICPs) and Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs),
– prompt implementation of TBPs to limit transmission,
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 11 of 49
– restricting access of ill visitors to the facility,
– instructing staff members with symptoms to stay at home and not come to work until
symptoms resolve,
– planning and implementation of strategies for surge capacity.
In preparedness for implementing these control measures all healthcare organisations should
undertake planning, and test the preparedness response for the various phases of a pandemic.
This includes:
● An assessment of their facilities’ current capabilities. Healthcare services will not be able
to operate under ‘business as usual’ during a COVID-19 pandemic. An assessment of
the practical ability to deliver care and implement control measures under the pressure
of an exceptional number of patient admissions and reduced staff numbers due to illness
must be assessed; ensuring their facilities’ most current blueprints are readily available
and accessible if needed to make necessary changes;
● An assessment of the current workforce;
● Working in a multidisciplinary team with healthcare and social care leaders/managers,
engineering, and clinical staff to plan for segregation of patients and/or services and
creation of adequate isolation rooms; identifying potential areas that could be converted
effectively with minimum modifications; and
● Defining engineering, administrative, and personnel requirements that can be efficiently
implemented during a pandemic COVID-19 event.8

Page 12 of 49
4. Infection prevention and control
precautions
Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission based precautions (TBPs)
must be used when managing patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
4.1 Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) definition
Standard infection control precautions (SICPs) are the basic infection prevention and control
measures necessary to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious agents from both
recognised and unrecognised sources. Sources include blood and other body fluids, secretions
and excretions (excluding sweat), non-intact skin or mucous membranes, and any equipment or
items in the care environment. SICPs should be used by all staff, in all care settings, at all
times, for all patients.
4.2 Transmission Based Precautions (TBPs) definition
Transmission based precautions (TBPs) are applied when SICPs alone are insufficient to
prevent cross transmission of an infectious agent. TBPs are additional infection control
precautions required when caring for a patient with a known or suspected infectious agent.
TBPs are categorised by the route of transmission of the infectious agent:
4.3 Routes of transmission:
● Contact precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission via direct
contact or indirectly from the immediate care environment (including care equipment).
This is the most common route of infection transmission.
● Droplet precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission over short
distances via droplets (>5μm) from the respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a
mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory
system to above the alveolar level. The maximum distance for cross transmission from
droplets has not been definitively determined, although a distance of approximately
1 metre (3 feet) around the infected individual has frequently been reported in the
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 13 of 49
medical literature as the area of risk.7, 9
● Airborne precautions: Used to prevent and control infection transmission without
necessarily having close contact via aerosols (≤5μm) from the respiratory tract of one
individual directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Aerosols
penetrate the respiratory system to the alveolar level.
Interrupting transmission of COVID-19 requires both droplet and contact precautions; if an
aerosol generating procedure (AGP) is being undertaken then airborne precautions are
required in addition to contact precautions.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 14 of 49
5. Standard infection control precautions
(SICPs)
5.1 Patient placement/assessment for infection risk
Patients must be promptly assessed for infection risk on arrival at the care area and, if possible,
prior to accepting a patient from another care area. Patients should be continuously reviewed
throughout their inpatient stay. In all healthcare settings, patients with symptoms of COVID-19
should be segregated from non-symptomatic patients as promptly as possible.
5.2 Hand hygiene
Hand hygiene is essential to reduce the transmission of infection in health and other care settings
and is a critical element of standard infection control precautions (SICPs). All staff, patients and
visitors should decontaminate their hands with alcohol based hand rub (ABHR) when entering
and leaving areas where care for –suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients is being
delivered.
Hand hygiene must be performed immediately before every episode of direct patient care and
after any activity or contact that potentially results in hands becoming contaminated, including
the removal of personal protective equipment (PPE), equipment decontamination and waste
handling: https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Your_5_Moments_For_Hand_Hygiene_Poster.pdf
Before performing hand hygiene:
● expose forearms (bare below the elbows);
● remove all hand and wrist jewellery (a single, plain metal finger ring is permitted but
should be removed (or moved up) during hand hygiene);
● ensure finger nails are clean, short and that artificial nails or nail products are not worn;
● cover all cuts or abrasions with a waterproof dressing.
https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Your_5_Moments_For_Hand_Hygiene_Poster.pdf
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 15 of 49
Technique for hand washing and rubbing
● Hand hygiene includes the use of ABHR for routine hand hygiene and hand washing with
soap and water, including thorough drying, if hands are visibly soiled or dirty.
● The technique for hand washing must be carried out thoroughly and for a time period
sufficient to inactivate the virus i.e. 40 to 60 seconds. See Appendix 1 – Best practice
how to hand wash.
● ABHR must be available for all staff as near to point of care as possible, where this is not
practical, personal dispensers should be used. The technique for use of ABHR to
decontaminate hands must be carried out thoroughly and for a time period sufficient to
inactivate the virus i.e. 20 to 30 seconds. See Appendix 2.
● Where no running water is available or hand hygiene facilities are lacking, such as in a
patient’s home, staff may use hand wipes followed by ABHR and should wash their
hands at the first available opportunity.
5.3 Respiratory and cough hygiene – ‘Catch it, bin it, kill it’
Patients, staff and visitors should be encouraged to minimise potential COVID-19 transmission
through good respiratory hygiene measures:
● Disposable, single-use tissues should be used to cover the nose and mouth when
sneezing, coughing or wiping and blowing the nose. Used tissues should be disposed of
promptly in the nearest waste bin.
● Tissues, waste bins (lined and foot operated) and hand hygiene facilities should be
available for patients, visitors and staff.
● Hands should be cleaned (using soap and water if possible, otherwise using ABHR) after
coughing, sneezing, using tissues or after any contact with respiratory secretions and
contaminated objects.
● Encourage patients to keep hands away from the eyes, mouth and nose.
● Some patients (e.g. the elderly and children) may need assistance with containment of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 16 of 49
respiratory secretions; those who are immobile will need a container (e.g. a plastic bag)
readily at hand for immediate disposal of tissues.
● In common waiting areas or during transportation, symptomatic patients may wear a
fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical face mask (FRSM), if tolerated, to minimise the
dispersal of respiratory secretions and reduce environmental contamination.
5.4 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Before undertaking any procedure, staff should assess any likely exposure and ensure PPE is
worn that provides adequate protection against the risks associated with the procedure or task
being undertaken. All staff should be trained in the proper use of all PPE that they may be
required to wear.
In addition:
● Staff who have had and recovered from COVID-19 should continue to follow infection
control precautions, including the PPE recommended in this document.
All PPE should be:
● compliant with the relevant BS/EN standards (European technical standards as adopted
in the UK);
● located close to the point of use;
● stored to prevent contamination in a clean/dry area until required for use (expiry dates
must be adhered to);
● single-use only;
● changed immediately after each patient and/or following completion of a procedure or task;
and
● disposed of after use into the correct waste stream i.e. healthcare/clinical waste (this may
require disposal via orange or yellow bag waste; local guidance will be provided depending
on the impact of the disease)
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 17 of 49
5.4.1 Disposable apron/gown
Disposable plastic aprons must be worn to protect staff uniform or clothes from contamination
when providing direct patient care and during environmental and equipment decontamination.
Fluid-resistant gowns must be worn when a disposable plastic apron provides inadequate cover
of staff uniform or clothes for the procedure/task being performed and when there is a risk of
extensive splashing of blood and/or other body fluids e.g. during aerosol generating procedures
(AGPs). If non fluid-resistant gowns are used, a disposable plastic apron should be worn
underneath.
Disposable aprons and gowns must be changed between patients and immediately after
completion of a procedure/task.
5.4.2 Disposable gloves
Disposable gloves must be worn when providing direct patient care and when exposure to
blood and/or other body fluids is anticipated/likely, including during equipment and
environmental decontamination. Gloves must be changed immediately following the care
episode or the task undertaken.
5.4.3 Eye protection/Face visor
Eye/face protection should be worn when there is a risk of contamination to the eyes from
splashing of secretions (including respiratory secretions), blood, body fluids or excretions. An
individual risk assessment should be carried out prior to/at the time of providing care.
Disposable, single-use, eye/face protection is recommended.
Eye/face protection can be achieved by the use of any one of the following:
● surgical mask with integrated visor;
● full face shield/visor;
● polycarbonate safety spectacles or equivalent;
Regular corrective spectacles are not considered adequate eye protection.
See Appendix 3 for the correct order of donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 18 of 49
5.5 Safe management of linen (laundry)
No special procedures are required; linen is categorised as ‘used’ or ‘infectious’. All linen used
in the direct care of patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 should be managed as
‘infectious’ linen. Linen must be handled, transported and processed in a manner that prevents
exposure to the skin and mucous membranes of staff, contamination of their clothing and the
environment:
Disposable gloves and an apron should be worn when handling infectious linen.
All linen should be handled inside the patient room/cohort area. A laundry receptacle should be
available as close as possible to the point of use for immediate linen deposit.
When handling linen do not:
● rinse, shake or sort linen on removal from beds/trolleys;
● place used/infectious linen on the floor or any other surfaces e.g. a locker/table top;
● re-handle used/infectious linen once bagged;
● overfill laundry receptacles; or
● place inappropriate items in the laundry receptacle e.g. used equipment/needles.
When managing infectious linen:
● place directly into a water-soluble/alginate bag and secure;
● place the water-soluble bag inside a clear polythene bag and secure;
● place the polythene bag into in the appropriately coloured (as per local policy) linen bag
(hamper).
All linen bags/receptacles must be tagged e.g. ward/care area and date. Store all
used/infectious linen in a designated, safe, lockable area whilst awaiting uplift. Organisational
preparedness plans should consider the safe storage of excess linen awaiting collection and for
maintaining supplies of clean linen for patient use.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 19 of 49
5.6 Staff uniforms/clothes
The appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) will protect staff uniform from
contamination in most circumstances. Healthcare facilities should provide changing
rooms/areas where staff can change into uniforms on arrival at work.
Organisations may consider the use of theatre scrubs for staff who do not usually wear a
uniform but who are likely to come into close contact with patients e.g. medical staff.
Healthcare laundry services should be used to launder staff uniforms. If there is no laundry
facility available, then uniforms should be transported home in a disposable plastic bag. This
bag should be disposed of into the household waste stream.
Uniforms should be laundered:
● separately from other household linen;
● in a load not more than half the machine capacity;
● at the maximum temperature the fabric can tolerate, then ironed or tumbled-dried.
NB. It is best practice to change into and out of uniforms at work and not wear them when
travelling; this is based on public perception rather than evidence of an infection risk. This does
not apply to community health workers who are required to travel between patients in the same
uniform.
5.7 Management of blood and body fluid spills
Spillages must be decontaminated in line with local policy. For an example, see Appendix 4.
5.8 Management of healthcare (including clinical) and non-clinical waste
Large volumes of waste may be generated by frequent use of PPE; advice from the local waste
management team should be sought prospectively on how to manage this.
Dispose of all waste as clinical waste.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 20 of 49
Waste from a possible or a confirmed case must be disposed of as Category B waste. The
transport of Category B waste is described in Health Technical Memorandum 07-01: Safe
management of healthcare waste. Disposal of all waste related to possible or confirmed cases
should be classified as infectious clinical waste suitable for alternative treatment, unless the
waste has other properties that would require it to be incinerated.
6. Transmission based precautions (TBPs)
for pandemic COVID-19
In addition to standard infection control precautions (SICPs), droplet precautions should be used
for patients known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19 in all healthcare settings.
● COVID-19 virus is expelled as droplets from the respiratory tract of an infected individual
(e.g. during coughing and sneezing) directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctiva of a
susceptible individual(s) or environmental surface(s).
● Droplets travel only short distances through the air; a distance of at least 1 metre has
been used for deploying droplet precautions.
However, this distance should be
considered as the minimum rather than an absolute:
● Transmission based precautions (TBPs (droplet) should be continued until the resolution
of the patient’s fever and respiratory symptoms.
6.1 Duration of precautions
Patients should remain in isolation/cohort with TBPs applied until the resolution of fever and
respiratory symptoms. The duration of TBPs may require modification based on the intelligence
gathered about COVID-19.
Patients can be discharged before resolution of symptoms provided they are deemed clinically
fit for discharge and should be advised to self-isolate as per staying at home guidance.
Discharge to long term care facilities should be discussed and agreed locally.
The decision to modify the duration of, or ‘stand down’ TBPs should be made by the clinical

Page 21 of 49
team managing the patient(s); based on patient condition and in agreement with the local
Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT).
6.2 Segregation and cohorting (inpatient settings)
6.2.1 Negative pressure isolation rooms
Special environmental controls, such as negative pressure isolation rooms, are not necessary
to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. However, in the early stages, and in high risk
settings, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may be isolated in negative pressure
rooms.
6.2.2 Single rooms
Wherever possible, patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed in single
rooms. In an escalating situation there is however likely to be a lack of single rooms/isolation
facilities.
Where single/isolation rooms are in short supply, and cohorting is not yet considered
possible (patient(s) awaiting laboratory confirmation), prioritise patients who have excessive
cough and sputum production for single/isolation room placement.
Single rooms in COVID-19 segregated areas should, wherever possible, be reserved for
performing aerosol generating procedures (AGPs).
Single rooms in non-COVID-19 areas should be reserved for patients requiring isolation for
other (non-influenza-like illness) reasons.
The prioritising of patients for isolation other than suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients
should be decided locally, based on patient need and local resources.
6.2.3 Cohort areas
If a single/isolation room is not available, cohort confirmed respiratory infected patients with
other patients confirmed to have COVID-19. Ensure patients are physically separated; a
distance of at least 1 metre. Use privacy curtains between the beds to minimise opportunities
for close contact. Where possible, a designated self-contained area or wing of the healthcare
facility should be used for the treatment and care of patients with COVID-19. This area should:
● include a reception area that is separate from the rest of the facility and should, if
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 22 of 49
feasible, have a separate entrance/exit from the rest of the building;
● not be used as a thoroughfare by other patients, visitors or staff, including patients being
transferred, staff going for meal breaks, and staff and visitors entering and exiting the
building;
● be separated from non-segregated areas by closed doors; and
● have signage displayed warning of the segregated area to control entry.
Hospitals should consider creating cohort areas which differentiate the level of care required.
It
may also be prudent to consider:
● the need for cohorting in single/mixed sex wards/bays
● underlying patient condition (immunocompromised);
● age groups when cohorting children; and
● routine childhood vaccination status when cohorting children.
6.2.4 Staff cohorting
Assigning a dedicated team of staff to care for patients in isolation/cohort rooms/areas is an
additional infection control measure. This should be implemented whenever there are sufficient
levels of staff available (so as not to have a negative impact on non-affected patients’ care).
Staff who have had confirmed COVID-19 and recovered should continue to follow the infection
control precautions, including personal protective equipment (PPE), as outlined in this
document (see section 7).
6.2.5 Visitors to segregated/cohort areas
Visitors to all areas of the healthcare facility should be restricted to essential visitors only, such
as parents of paediatric patients or an affected patient’s main carer. Local risk assessment and
practical management should be considered, ensuring this is a pragmatic and proportionate
response, including the consideration of whether there is a requirement for visitors to wear PPE
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 23 of 49
or respiratory protective equipment (RPE).
Visiting may be suspended if considered appropriate. All visitors entering a segregated/cohort
area must be instructed on hand hygiene. They must not visit any other care area.
Signage to support restrictions is critical. Visitors with COVID-19 symptoms must not enter the
healthcare facility. Visitors who are symptomatic should be encouraged to leave and must not
be permitted to enter areas where there are immunocompromised patients.
6.3 Patient transfers and transport
6.3.1 Intra-hospital transfers:
● The movement and transport of patients from their single room/cohort area should be
limited to essential purposes only. Staff at the receiving destination must be informed
that the patient has or is suspected to have COVID-19.
● If transport/movement is necessary, consider offering the patient a fluid-resistant (Type
IIR) surgical mask (FRSM) to be worn during transportation, to minimise the dispersal of
respiratory droplets when this can be tolerated.
● Patients must be taken straight to and returned from clinical departments and must not
wait in communal areas. If possible, patients should be placed at the end of clinical lists.
6.3.2 Transfer from primary care/community settings:
● If transfer from a primary care facility or community setting to hospital is required, the
ambulance service should be informed of the infectious status of the patient.
● Staff of the receiving ward/department should be notified in advance of any transfer and
must be informed that the patient has or is suspected to have COVID-19.
6.3.3 Inter-hospital transfers:
● Patient transfer from one healthcare facility to another should be avoided; transfer may
be undertaken if medically necessary for specialist care arising out of complications or
concurrent medical events (for example, cardiac angioplasty, and renal dialysis). If
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 24 of 49
transfer is essential, the ambulance service and receiving hospital must be advised in
advance of the infectious status of the patient.
6.4 Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Personal protective equipment (PPE) for the care of patients with COVID-19 is summarised in
Table 1, see Appendix 3 for how to put on and remove PPE.

6.4.1 Fluid resistant (Type IIR) surgical face masks (FRSM)
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 25 of 49
Fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical masks (FRSMs) are worn to protect the wearer from the
transmission of COVID-19 by respiratory droplets.
In all healthcare settings:
● A FRSM must be worn when working in close contact (within 1 metre) of a patient with
COVID-19 symptoms.
This provides a physical barrier to minimise contamination of the
mucosa of the mouth and nose.
● In an area where pandemic COVID-19 patients have been cohorted together, it may be
more practical for staff to wear a FRSM at all times, rather than only when in close
contact with a patient. Similarly, in primary care/outpatient settings it may be more
practical for staff working in a segregated (COVID-19 patient) area to wear a FRSM for
the duration they are in the patient area.
●
A FRSM for COVID-19 should:
– be well fitted covering both nose and mouth;
– not be allowed to dangle around the neck of the wearer after or between each
use;
– not be touched once put on;
– be changed when they become moist or damaged;
– be removed outside the patient room, cohort area or 1 metre away from the
patient with possible/confirmed COVID-19; and
– be worn once and then discarded as healthcare (clinical) waste (hand
hygiene must always be performed after disposal).
The provision of a FRSM for patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 at point of
assessment or triage in any healthcare setting should be considered if the patient can tolerate it
(except when in a dedicated COVID-19 area).
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 26 of 49
6.4.2 Filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirators
Filtering face piece (class 3) (FFP3) respirators should be worn whenever there is a risk of
airborne transmission of pandemic COVID-19 i.e. during aerosol generating procedures (AGPs)
and at all times in intensive care unit (ICU), intensive therapy unit (ITU), high dependency unit
(HDU) where COVID-19 patients are cohorted.
All tight fitting respiratory protective equipment (RPE) (i.e. FFP3 respirators) must be:
● single use (disposable) and fluid-resistant*. Fluid resistant FFP3’s should be worn with
appropriate eye protection;
● fit tested on all healthcare staff who may be required to wear an FFP3 respirator to
ensure an adequate seal/fit according to the manufacturers’ guidance; fit checked
(according to the manufacturers’ guidance) every time an FFP3 respirator is donned to
ensure an adequate seal has been achieved;
● compatible with other facial protection used i.e. protective eyewear so that this does not
interfere with the seal of the respiratory protection. Regular corrective spectacles are not
considered adequate eye protection;
● disposed of and replaced if breathing becomes difficult, the respirator is damaged or
distorted, the respirator becomes obviously contaminated by respiratory secretions or
other body fluids, or if a proper face fit cannot be maintained; and
● be worn once and then discarded as healthcare (clinical) waste (hand hygiene
must always be performed after disposal).
*If wearing a FFP3 that is not fluid resistant, a full face shield/ visor must be worn
A FFP3 respirator, although ‘single use’, can be worn for as long as comfortable, for example
for the duration of a ward round or providing clinical care.
Once separated from the face FFP3s must be discarded.
In the absence of an anteroom/lobby remove FFP3 respirators in a safe area (e.g. outside the
isolation/cohort room/area).
All other PPE should be removed in the patient care area.

6.5 Aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs)
Aerosols generated by medical procedures are one route for the transmission of the COVID-19
virus. The following procedures are considered to be potentially infectious AGPs:
● Intubation, extubation and related procedures;
● Tracheotomy/tracheostomy procedures;
● Manual ventilation;
● Open suctioning;
● Bronchoscopy;
● Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) e.g. Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) and
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ventilation (CPAP);
● Surgery and post-mortem procedures in which high-speed devices are used;
● High-frequency oscillating ventilation (HFOV);
● High-flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO)
● Induction of sputum (see glossary);
● Some dental procedures (e.g. high speed drilling).
For patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19, any of these potentially infectious AGPs
should only be carried out when essential. Where possible, these procedures should be carried
out in a single room with the doors shut. Only those healthcare staff who are needed to
undertake the procedure should be present. A disposable, fluid repellant surgical gown, gloves,
eye protection and a FFP3 respirator should be worn by those undertaking the procedure and
those in the room.
Certain other procedures/equipment may generate an aerosol from material other than patient
secretions but are not considered to represent a significant infectious risk. Procedures in this
category include:
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 29 of 49
● administration of pressurised humidified oxygen;
● administration of medication via nebulisation.
Note: During nebulisation, the aerosol derives from a non-patient source (the fluid in the
nebuliser chamber) and does not carry patient-derived viral particles. If a particle in the aerosol
coalesces with a contaminated mucous membrane, it will cease to be airborne and therefore
will not be part of an aerosol. Staff should use appropriate hand hygiene when helping patients
to remove nebulisers and oxygen masks.
6.6 Management of equipment and the care environment
Decontamination of equipment and the care environment must be performed using either:
● A combined detergent/disinfectant solution at a dilution of 1,000 parts per million
available chlorine (ppm available chlorine (av.cl.)); or
● A general purpose neutral detergent in a solution of warm water followed by a
disinfectant solution of 1,000ppm av.cl.
Only cleaning (detergent) and disinfectant products supplied by employers are to be used.
Products must be prepared and used according to the manufacturers’ instructions and
recommended product ""contact times"" must be followed. If alternative cleaning
agents/disinfectants are to be used, they should only on the advice of the IPCT and conform to
EN standard 14476 for virucidal activity
6.6.1 Equipment
Patient care equipment should be single-use items if possible. Reusable (communal) non-
invasive equipment should as far as possible be allocated to the individual patient or cohort of
patients.
Reusable (communal) non-invasive equipment must be decontaminated:
● between each patient and after patient use;
● after blood and body fluid contamination; and
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 30 of 49
● at regular intervals as part of equipment cleaning.
An increased frequency of decontamination should be considered for reusable non-invasive
care equipment when used in isolation/cohort areas.
• ventilators should be protected with a high efficiency filter, such as BS EN 13328-1
• closed system suction should be used
See Appendix 4 for guidance on routine decontamination of reusable non-invasive patient care
equipment.
Avoid the use of fans that re-circulate the air.10
There is no need to use disposable plates or cutlery. Crockery and cutlery can be washed by
hand or in a dishwasher using household detergent and hand-hot water after use.
6.6.2 Environment
Patient isolations rooms, cohort areas and clinical rooms must be decontaminated at least
daily. Clinical rooms should also be decontaminated after clinical sessions for patients with
suspected/known pandemic COVID-19. In addition, patient isolation rooms must be terminally
cleaned:
● Following resolution of symptoms, discharge or transfer (this includes removal and
laundering of all curtains and bed screens);
● Once vacated by staff following an AGP. Clearance of infectious particles after an AGP
is dependent on the mechanical/natural ventilation and air change per hour(ACH) within
the room. A single air change is estimated to remove 63% of airborne contaminants;
after 5 air changes, less than 1% of airborne contamination is thought to remain.
In an
isolation room with 10-12 ACH a minimum of 20 minutes is considered pragmatic; in a
side room with 6 ACH this would be approximately 1 hour. Advice should be sought from
the local Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT).
An increased frequency of decontamination should be incorporated into the environmental
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 31 of 49
decontamination schedules for areas where there may be higher environmental contamination
rates e.g.
● toilets/commodes particularly if patients have diarrhoea; and
● “frequently touched” surfaces such as medical equipment, door/toilet handles and locker
tops, patient call bells, over bed tables and bed rails should be cleaned at least twice
daily and when known to be contaminated with secretions, excretions or body fluids.
Domestic/cleaning staff performing environmental decontamination should:
● be allocated to specific area(s) and not be moved between COVID-19 and non-COVID-
19 care areas;
● be trained in which personal protective equipment (PPE) to use and the correct methods
of wearing, removing and disposing of PPE. The care environment should be kept clean
and clutter free. All non-essential items including toys, books and magazines should be
removed from reception and waiting areas, consulting and treatment rooms, emergency
departments, day rooms and lounges.
When made available, these items should not be
shared. All toys must be cleanable and should be cleaned regularly (preferably at the
same time as the environment).
6.7 Handling dead bodies
The principles of Standard Infection Control Precautions (SICPs) and Transmission Based
Precautions (TBPs) continue to apply whilst deceased individuals remain in the care
environment. This is due to the ongoing risk of infectious transmission via contact although the
risk is usually lower than for living patients. Where the deceased was known or suspected to
have been infected with COVID-19, there is no requirement for a body bag, and viewing,
hygienic preparations, post-mortem and embalming are all permitted.
Following a risk assessment of the potential post-mortem risk pathways PHE has developed
this advice in line with the principles set out in the HSE guidance for droplet transmission risk
as set out in: ‘Managing infection risks when handling the deceased: Guidance for the
mortuary, post-mortem room and funeral premises, and during exhumation’.

Page 32 of 49
7. Occupational health and staff
deployment
Prompt recognition of cases of COVID-19 among healthcare staff is essential to limit the
spread. Healthcare staff with influenza-like illness should not come to work. As a general
principle, healthcare staff who provide care in areas for suspected/confirmed patients should not
care for other patients, although exceptions may be necessary.
A risk assessment is required for health and social care staff at high risk of complications from
COVID-19, including pregnant staff. Employers should:
● Discuss with employees who are at risk or are pregnant the need to be deployed away from
areas used for the care of those who have, or are clinically suspected of having, COVID-19;
or, in the primary care setting, from clinics set up to manage people with COVID-19
symptoms.
● Ensure that advice is available to all healthcare staff, including specific advice to those at
risk from complications.
Bank, agency and locum staff should follow the same deployment advice as permanent staff.
As part of their employer’s duty of care, providers have a role to play in ensuring that a fit
testing programme is in place for those who may need to wear filtering face piece (class 3)
(FFP3) respirator. In the event of a breach in infection control procedures e.g. an incorrectly worn
FFP3 respirator during a potentially infectious aerosol generating procedure (AGP, staff should
be reviewed by occupational health.
Occupational health departments should lead on the implementation of systems to monitor staff
illness and absence.
Where possible, staff who have had confirmed COVID-19 (early in the stages of the outbreak
this would be via virology confirmation, thereafter, this is likely to be as per case definition)
should work in the cohort areas and care for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients. Such
staff should continue to follow the infection control precautions, including personal protective
equipment (PPE), as outlined in this document.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 33 of 49
8. Specific settings
The following guidance is given to assist specific care settings to implement the principles of
standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission based precautions (TBPs)
described in this document, which apply in all care settings.
8.1 Care home settings
Isolation within a care home for a known/suspected infection can be achieved in the persons’
bedroom in most cases. Residents should remain in their bedroom whilst considered infectious
(as described above) and the door should remain closed (if unable to isolate the individual then
this should be documented).
8.2 Primary care
In primary care settings (e.g. General Practitioner (GP) practices) suspected COVID-19
patients should be segregated in place or time from other patients, this may be achieved by:
● Creating a separate area within the facility for care of suspected patients, including
separate waiting and reception areas if possible. The area should be separated from
non-segregated areas by closed doors. To control entry, signage should be displayed
warning of the segregated area.
● Alternatively, suspected patients should be seen at a different time from other patients,
with disinfection of shared areas taking place between different clinics.
● GP practices may make arrangements for distinct COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 clinics.
(Non-essential GP clinics may need to be cancelled to enable this).
● Primary care staff should, wherever possible be allocated to either COVID-19
or
other patients.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 34 of 49
8.3 Outpatient settings
For patients who develop symptoms and have long term health conditions that require
attendance at outpatient settings e.g. hospital day care, options include:
● deferring the procedure and re-scheduling the next appointment;
● transferring the patient to a designated hospital with isolation or cohort facilities;
● introducing physical barriers such as screens in special units to separate patients with
symptoms of COVID-19.
8.4 Dental surgeries
Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 should not be seen for routine dental care. If a dental
emergency is suspected such as severe haemorrhaging or difficulty in breathing the patient
should be seen in a hospital environment.
If emergency dental care is required staff in attendance should be kept to a minimum and must
wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (see table 1) particularly if this involves
high speed drilling section 6.5.
8.5 Home visits
Home visits should continue as long as required to patients without COVID-19. If it becomes
necessary to suspend some home visits, alternative arrangements must be put in place to
maintain contact (e.g. telephone liaison). Health and social care staff performing non-deferrable
essential visits (for example, child protection) to households with suspected/confirmed COVID-
19, should follow the infection control precautions in this document.
8.6 Ambulances
In ambulances, patient segregation can be achieved by:
● designating an ambulance(s) for transfer of patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19
for the duration of each shift;
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 35 of 49
● transporting coughing and sneezing patients on their own whenever possible. However, if
pressure upon the service occurs, two patients with symptoms of COVID-19 may be
transferred together and should wear a fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask (FRSM).
Depending on the stage of the pandemic and an assessment of risk, ambulance staff may be
required to wear respiratory protective equipment (RPE). This will be determined locally.
8.7 Emergency departments and acute assessment units
Emergency departments and acute assessment units may be overwhelmed with patients
seeking care during the peak of a pandemic. Alternative approaches to triage and initial
assessment will be required to:
● rapidly screen and identify those who have symptoms of COVID-19 upon their arrival;
● separate symptomatic patients from others to reduce the risk of transmission; and
● determine as early as possible the type of care patients will require (i.e. see and
discharge or admit for treatment).
8.7.1 Screening and triage
Signage should be displayed prior to and on entry to assessment units instructing patients with
symptoms to inform reception staff immediately on their arrival.
A triage practitioner(s) should be based in the reception to manage patient flow, including
deferral of patients who do not require emergency care.
8.7.2 Reception area
Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 should be triaged to a segregated waiting and
assessment area immediately. Patients should be instructed to stay in this waiting area and not
visit other departments or, parts of the hospital/unit, or go to public areas such as the cafeteria.
Signage and physical barriers should be used as appropriate.
If separate areas for patients with symptoms of COVID-19 cannot be established, an alternative
area/site should be set up for those at highest risk of complications from COVID-19 and who do
not have respiratory symptoms (e.g. patients presenting for dialysis, patients with a history of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 36 of 49
blood cell or organ transplantation, chemotherapy, or who are immunocompromised for other
reasons).
Patients who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 but require prompt acute care assessment
should be triaged to a specific waiting and examination area, physically separate from the
COVID-19 waiting and assessment area.
8.7.3Critical care
PPE must be worn:
• all respiratory equipment must be protected with a high efficiency filter (such as BS EN 13328-
1). This filter must be disposed of after use
• disposable respiratory equipment should be used wherever possible. Re-usable equipment
must, as a minimum, be decontaminated in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
• a closed suctioning system must be used
• ventilator circuits should not be broken unless necessary
• ventilators must be placed on standby when carrying out bagging
8.7.4 Theatres
• theatres must be informed in advance of a patient transfer of a confirmed or possible COVID-
19 positive case
• the patient should be transported directly to the operating theatre and should wear a surgical
mask if it can be tolerated
• the patient should be anaesthetised and recovered in the theatre. Staff should wear protective
clothing but only those at risk of exposure from aerosol generating procedures, i.e during
intubation need to wear FFP3 respirators and full gowns. considerations about the use of
respiratory/anaesthetic equipment are addressed in the critical care section above
• instruments and devices should be decontaminated in the normal manner in accordance with
manufacturers’ advice
• both laryngoscope handle and blade should either be single use or reprocessed in the Sterile
Supply Department. Video laryngoscope blades should be single use and scope/handle
decontaminated as per manufacture instructions.
• the theatre should be cleaned as per local policy for infected cases, paying particular attention
to hand contact points on the anaesthetic machine
• theatres should not be used by staff or patients for 20 minutes after the patient leaves if
conventionally ventilated, or 5 minutes if ultraclean ventilation is used
• possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19 should be placed at the end of the list where feasible

Appendix 7 Glossary
Aerosol-generating procedures
(AGPs)
Certain medical and patient care activities that
can result in the release of airborne particles
(aerosols). AGPs can create a risk of airborne
transmission of infections that are usually only
spread by droplet transmission.
Airborne Transmission
The spread of infection from one person to
another by airborne particles (aerosols)
containing infectious agents.
Airborne particles
Very small particles that may contain
infectious agents. They can remain in the air for
long periods of time and can be carried over
long distances by air currents. Airborne particles
can be released when a person coughs
or sneezes, and during aerosol generating
procedures (AGPs). “Droplet nuclei” are
aerosols formed from the evaporation of larger
droplet particles (see Droplet Transmission).
Aerosols formed from droplet particles in this
way behave as other aerosols.
Airborne precautions Measures used to prevent and control infections
spread without necessarily having close patient
contact via aerosols (less than or equal to 5μm)
from the respiratory tract of one individual
directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae
of another individual. Aerosols can penetrate the
respiratory system to the alveolar level.
BS/EN standards
Mandatory technical specifications created by
either the British Standards Institute (BS) or
European Standardisation Organisations (EN) in
collaboration with government bodies, industry
experts and trade associations. They aim to
ensure the quality and safety of products,
services and systems.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 44 of 49
Cohort area
An area (room, bay, ward) in which two or more
patients (a cohort) with the same confirmed
infection are placed. A cohort area should be
physically separate from other patients.
Contact precautions
Measures used to prevent and control infections
that spread via direct contact with the patient or
indirectly from the patient’s immediate care
environment (including care equipment). This is
the most common route of infection
transmission.
Contact transmission Contact transmission is the most common route
of transmission, and consists of two distinct
types: direct contact and indirect contact. Direct
transmission occurs when microorganisms are
transmitted directly from an infectious individual
to another individual without the involvement of
another contaminated person or object (fomite).
Indirect transmission occurs when
microorganisms are transmitted from an
infectious individual to another individual through
a contaminated object or person (fomite) or
person.
COVID-19 COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory
disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The
disease was discovered in China in December
2019 and has since spread around the world.
Droplet precautions
Measures used to prevent and control infections
spread over short distances (at least 1 metre (3
feet) via droplets (greater than 5μm) from the
respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a
mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another
individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory
system to above the alveolar level.
Droplet transmission
The spread of infection from one person to
another by droplets containing infectious agents.
Eye/Face protection
Worn when there is a risk from splashing of
secretion (including respiratory secretions),
eye/face protection can be achieved by the use
of any one of the following: a surgical mask with
integrated visor; a full face visor/shield; or
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 45 of 49
polycarbonate safety spectacles or equivalent;
FFP3 Respiratory protection that is worn over the nose
and mouth designed to protect the wearer from
inhaling hazardous substances, including
airborne particles (aerosols). FFP stands for
filtering face piece. There are three categories of
FFP respirator: FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3. An FFP3
respirator provides the highest level of
protection, and is the only category of respirator
legislated for use in UK healthcare settings.
Fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical face
mask (FRSM)
A disposable fluid-resistant mask worn over the
nose and mouth to protect the mucous
membranes of the wearer’s nose and mouth
from splashes and infectious droplets. FRSMs
can also be used to protect patients.
When
recommended for infection control purposes a
'surgical face mask' typically denotes a
fluid-resistant (Type IIR) surgical mask.
Fluid-resistant
A term applied to fabrics that resist liquid
penetration, often used interchangeably with
'fluid-repellent' when describing the properties of
protective clothing or equipment.
Frequently touched surfaces
Surfaces of the environment which are
commonly touched/come into contact with
human hands.
High Consequence Infectious Disease
(HCID)
In the UK, a high consequence infectious disease
(HCID) is defined according to the following
criteria: Acute infectious disease; typically has a
high case-fatality rate; may not have effective
prophylaxis or treatment; often difficult to
recognise and detect rapidly; ability to spread in
the community and within healthcare settings; and
requires an enhanced individual, population and
system response to ensure it is managed
effectively, efficiently and safely.
Healthcare/clinical waste Waste produced as a result of healthcare
activities for example soiled dressings, sharps.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 46 of 49
High risk units
Intensive care units, intensive therapy units and
high dependency units.
Incubation period
The period between the infection of an individual
by a pathogen and the manifestation of the illness
or disease it causes.
Induction of sputum Induction of sputum typically involves the
administration of nebulised saline to moisten and
loosen respiratory secretions (this may be
accompanied by chest physiotherapy (percussion
and vibration)) to induce forceful coughing.
Infectious linen
Linen that has been used by a patient who is
known or suspected to be infectious and/or linen
that is contaminated with blood and/or other body
fluids e.g. faeces.
Long term health condition
Defined as:
• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
bronchitis, emphysema or asthma
• Heart disease
• Kidney disease
• Liver disease
• Stroke or a transient ischaemic attack (TIA)
• Diabetes
• Lowered immunity as a result of disease or
medical treatment, such as steroid
medication or cancer treatment
• Neurological condition, such as
Parkinson's disease, motor neurone
disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), cerebral
palsy, or a learning disability
• Problem with spleen, including sickle cell
disease, or had spleen removed
• A BMI of 40 or above (obese).
Negative pressure isolation room
A room which maintains permanent negative
pressure i.e. air flow is from the outside adjacent
space (e.g. corridor) into the room and then
exhausted to the outdoors.
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.
Page 47 of 49
New and emerging viruses (including
respiratory viruses)
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) defines emerging infectious diseases as:
• New infections resulting from changes in or
evolution of existing organisms.
• Known infections spreading to new
geographical areas or populations.
• Previously unrecognised infections
appearing in areas undergoing ecological
transformation.
• Old infections re-emerging as a result of
antibiotic resistance in known agents or
breakdown in public health measures.
Personal Protective Equipment
(PPE)
Equipment a person wears to protect themselves
from risks to their health or safety, including
exposure to infection agents. The level of PPE
required depends on: Suspected/known infectious
agent; severity of the illness caused; transmission
route of the infectious agent; and the
procedure/task being undertaken.
Respiratory droplets
A small droplet, such as a particle of moisture
released from the mouth during coughing,
sneezing, or speaking.
Respiratory symptoms ‘Respiratory symptoms’ include rhinorrhoea
(runny nose); sore throat; cough; difficulty
breathing or shortness of breath.
Segregation
Physically separating or isolating from other
people.
SARS-CoV Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,
the virus responsible for the 2003 outbreak of
human coronavirus disease.
SARS-CoV-2 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,
the virus responsible for the 2019 outbreak of
COVID-19 disease.
Standard infection control
precautions (SICPs)
SICPs are the basic infection prevention and
control measures necessary to reduce the risk of
transmission of an infectious agent from both
recognised and unrecognised sources of
COVID-19: Guidance for infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. Version 1.0.

infection.
Single room
A room with space for one patient and usually
contains as a minimum: a bed; locker/wardrobe;
and a clinical wash-hand basin.
Staff cohorting
When staff care for one specific group of patients
and do not move between different patient
cohorts. Patient cohorts may include for example
‘symptomatic’, ‘asymptomatic and exposed’, or
‘asymptomatic and unexposed’ patient groups.
Transmission based precautions
Additional precautions to be used in addition to
SICPs when caring for patients with a known or
suspected infection or colonisation.
