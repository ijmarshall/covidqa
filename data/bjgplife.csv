Video consultations: a guide for practice
by BJGP Life | Coronavirus | 0
Many practices are now using or considering using alternatives to face-to-face consultations because of concerns about Covid-19. Important new information and guidance is now available to support video consultations. Produced by researchers at the University of Oxford, the document covers five key topics. When are video consultations appropriate, how can a practice get ready for them, how can clinicians conduct high-quality video consultations, what can patients do to prepare for and take part in them, and what is the research evidence for their quality and safety?

The Changing Face of Medicine project is gathering momentum. As President of the BMA, Professor Pali Hungin launched a project to look into the impact of fast moving technological advances, the shifting role of the doctor, the adequacy of medical education, the nature of public and patient expectations of clinicians, the need for visionary medical leadership, and the well-being of clinicians themselves.

Women in medicine: increasing in numbers but not regard
by Emily Bailey | Opinion | 0
Throughout the last century we have witnessed major advancements for women in the UK, but gender inequalities continue to exist in the workplace. The NHS, established with the intent to treat everyone equally, is no exception. On average, female GPs — who now make up more than half of our workforce — continue to feel undervalued, hold less senior roles, and receive lower pay when compared to men.

My first year as a GP physician associate
by BJGP Life | Opinion | 0
When I first qualified as a physician associate (PA), I had no intention to work in general practice, at least until later in my career. I was unsure of the impact a PA could have in a GP setting prior to the much anticipated statutory regulation and associated prescribing rights. Having a physician associate within the practice has meant greater accessibility to appointments, less pressure on the on-call doctor, and improved prescribing rates in certain areas.

Well, not if you’ve chosen to pursue a career in general practice. Whilst my colleagues were preparing evidence of their accomplishments and practising expected questions, I was revising for the entrance exam and practising OSCE based scenarios.

Review: The Possibilities are Endless
Posted by Euan Lawson | 2 Feb 2015 | Arts | 0
Euan Lawson (@euan_lawson) is the Deputy Editor, BJGP.
In 2005, Edywn Collins had a brain haemorrhage. There’s no gentle intro to this film; it is immersive as we are plunged into a fragmentary sequence of memories, images and sounds. There’s footage of Helmsdale, the hills and the beaches where Edwyn and his family spend their time, and childhood memories collide with adulthood. Edwyn offers broken commentary, his voice hesistant, frequently stuck and unintelligible. Grace, his wife, speaks to Edwyn, and we can feel her at the bedside comforting him. It’s claustrophobic, frightening and frustrating. It’s also mesmerising and quietly horrific as we eavesdrop on an inner life where your brain is unanchored, adrift.
How do you reconstruct your life after a brain injury that leaves you with a hemiplegia and practically aphasic? His only words: Yes. No. Grace Maxwell. The possibilities are endless. He has to learn to read again. Edwyn draws the same rough portrait of a man again. And again. He struggles to remember how many days there are in a year. It took me a while to place Edwyn and it wasn’t until they showed a clip of his biggest chart hit, A Girl Like You, that I had him. A handsome, tall, prodigiously talented musician with a self-assured melodious Scottish accent. Grace and Edwyn just kept going, tiny amounts upwards and onwards. As Grace says, sometimes you just have to “suck it up”. The words of his songs start to come back to him and he sings again.
There is often a whiff of the condescending when relating life-affirming stories of the apparently afflicted. There’s no room in this story for any plastic admiration; nothing in this film plays on victimhood. It’s just Edwyn’s and Grace’s story with no smear of self-pity to blur the vision. This is not a motivational movie with the life story burnished so we may weep at the indomitable human spirit. It’s not making promises that by watching you will be a better person. Yet there is a quiet satisfaction here and an insight into brain injury that embraces the medium of cinema.
Spoiler: You will be disappointed if you are hanging out for a magical moment of recovery with all his memories and skills flooding back in an exultant moment of slow-mo triumph. Ultimately, we come to Edwyn as he his now: ribbing his wife; laughing with his son. He’s not where he was before 2005, perhaps not where he might have expected to be: but then who is? Edwyn is laconic: Possibly before my stroke I was a bit too focussed. He goes on in his staccato style: The next stage of my career. No, no, I was nice. Don’t get me wrong. But arrogant in a way. I’m over that phase.

BJGP Long Read: How to enjoy your consultations
Posted by BJGP Life | 26 Feb 2019 | BJGP Long Read | 1
Julian Marsden has been a GP in Luton for 33 years. He is FRCGP, Provost of the Beds & Herts Faculty, and is a retired Training Programme Director for the Luton GPSTP
I’ve been a GP for over 30 years, but I still enjoy what I do. As others around me take early retirement, I sometimes ask myself why I still enjoy the job and keep doing it. For me, it’s the interaction with patients, getting to know them, forming and developing a relationship where we can feel comfortable, doing something useful and sharing some humour where I can.
The GP consultation is at the heart of what the GP does. It’s the best bit, sitting with and getting to know your patient and their problems and trying together to find a way forward. Anything and everything can come the way of the GP, which makes it all the more interesting, and we have the opportunity to see our patients again and get to know them, even if only a little, and this is fun and rewarding for both; continuity of care is much valued and a strength of general practice.
It helps, of course, to be able to consult effectively, and I learned from Roger Neighbour’s Inner Consultation, the Calgary-Cambridge Guide by Silverman, Kurtz and Draper, and others, such as The Anxious Patient by Bendix and Peter Tate’s The Doctor’s Communication Handbook. Listening to the advice of many GP luminaries such as Roger Neighbour himself, Jonathan Silverman, David Haslam and others helps reinforce important messages.
This isn’t a consultation guide; instead it encapsulates some of the things I have learned over many years.
Developing consultation skills goes on throughout one’s career and if you didn’t make time to read those consultation texts during your training, why not make time afterwards? The last textbook I read on the subject was Neighbour’s Inner Physician, an excellent and thoughtful book giving rich insight into how we consult but at a deeper level than a consultation guide, exploring some of the perceptual skills and developing an awareness of what we are thinking and feeling and how this might be useful during the consultation.
There is so much good advice out there and it can seem daunting to distil this into a simple guide. This isn’t a consultation guide; instead it encapsulates some of the things I have learned over many years; it is what I do. There might be one or two ideas that may be useful to you.
Simple advice is easier to remember, however. David Haslam spoke about his four rules: Shut Up, Listen, Do Something Useful, and Care. I love that, so simple, succinct and so true. Roger Neighbour talks about the patient’s bit, then the doctor’s bit, then the shared bit. Again, so simple but so true; the shared bit reminds me about shared understanding and shared management plans.
I like to put something personal about patients that is easily seen, such as in the reminders section.
Before I start, I try and look at the patient record. This may take less than a minute so it’s perfectly feasible. Patients will often assume that you know everything in their records even though in reality you haven’t had 20 minutes to read all the letters! But a brief look at the summary and problem list and the previous consultation is time well spent. The repeat prescription list gives a quick clue and if full of cardiac meds then you know they have a cardiac problem, for instance. I like to put something personal about patients that is easily seen, such as in the reminders section. This might be only visible to you, so you can mention the name of their spouse, if they have children, what they do for a living, what they do at other times such as sport or other hobbies, or what they are studying or hoping to do in their future career, or their favourite football team.
I add this stuff after the consultation and it can be read with a second’s glance before they come in. The personal details might be relevant in the consultation, but if not can be a basis for friendly conversation at the end of the consultation, which is fun and all part of developing rapport which helps next time you see them. It is difficult to achieve the continuity that GPs had in the past, as we usually work in teams nowadays and not necessarily full-time, but a brief mention of something in the personal section helps the patient feel known as a person. This helps with the “Getting to know your patient” and I think it makes a big difference.
Rapport is so important. The initial smile and greeting are crucial. With small children, I usually focus on the parent with my best attempt at a warm smile, as if Mum is happy and welcomed and at ease, the child will sense this and hopefully relax a little. Expressing delight in a coloured pair of socks or the design on a T shirt is a helpful distraction though this is reserved for small children as adults might give me a funny look! I still wear cartoon ties, even though they went out of fashion 20 years ago; but it is one way I have of not taking myself too seriously and helping my younger patients feel a little more relaxed, especially if they’re two years old and frightened of doctors.
We have all heard about the golden minute, whereby, if you allow the patient, most of the relevant information will emerge, so long as they are not interrupted. Or will it? Actually, we generally only elicit half the patient’s complaints and concerns. And the main concern may not be the first mentioned. Listening and watching carefully with full attention is key.
As we have two ears but only one mouth, we should listen twice as much as we talk.
Listening carefully is crucial, and showing that you have listened equally so, whether for a complicated history or minor illness as subsequent reassurance will be more effective if the mother of a toddler with a cough and a temperature who ran smiling into the room may be worried nonetheless that something is really wrong. I once heard at a trainers’ seminar that as we have two ears but only one mouth, we should listen twice as much as we talk.
Caring, or compassion, and showing it, is so important for patients. We can be forgiven for a multitude of errors if we are nice about it. How to show compassion? That you care?
There are some simple things that I have found to help. After the patient has told you about their problem, acknowledge what they have said, so they know you have understood, then say something empathic. For example: “She’s been coughing all night and been burning up.” You might say something like: “That must have worried you?” or “And you’ve had no sleep either then?” it might be tempting to ask if her child is well-cooked, having been burned to a frazzle, but this doesn’t work.
I know a GP who welcomes his patients into his consulting room by standing up and, with arms wide, proceeds to hug them. I don’t do this. Touch can be powerful of course, and a light hand on your patient’s forearm can say a thousand words, but I don’t do this much either. Perhaps in a bereavement situation. David Haslam once said at a conference that elderly patients he saw on home visits appreciated it if he sat down. This sounds simple, but of course it shows clearly that he has the time and inclination to listen and not rush, as opposed to standing there and appearing impatient to get on.
I do know some doctors who stand throughout the consultation to encourage speed, but I don’t do this. I have heard that some doctors have a chair for the patient with a slope on the seat to encourage the patient to get up sooner, but I don’t do this either! At the beginning, I stand up, find the patient from the waiting room and smile and greet them. I usually say: “Hi, How can I help?” as I ask them to sit down, or after they have sat down. I try and observe the patient as they come in and a limp with a wince is a good clue or a worried expression will raise my antennae, for instance.
Let them tell their story. Allow them to voice concerns and volunteer ideas
. If you allow the patient to talk, they will usually tell you why they have come to see you, what their problems are and why they may be concerned. Let them tell their story. Allow them to voice concerns and volunteer ideas. Open questions facilitate this. It is important to let your patient know that you have heard and understood what they have said, and a simple summary spoken back to them helps. If you don’t, they may keep repeating themselves and feel frustrated. A simple summary allows the patient to feel understood and then allow the consultation to progress; or it may allow the patient to mention something else which may be important.
This is part of agenda setting and where appropriate, a negotiation about what can be covered first, second etc and what can be deferred if need be. “X sounds important and Y also so shall we deal with those first and see how we get on?” is better than “I only have 10 minutes, so may not have time to deal with….”. Then I ‘go with the flow’, where the consultation goes naturally, exploring and clarifying, sharing thoughts. Structure of the consultation is important but so is flexibility. Drilling down to clarify issues can involve closed questions but avoid these early on. Some local knowledge helps: the word ‘flu’ in Luton means a runny nose, nothing more, nothing less. Eye contact, posture and facial expressions are some of the non-verbal techniques we use to facilitate communication and staring at the computer does nothing to promote engagement with the patient.
Exploring ideas, concerns and expectations is a mantra distilled into us as trainees and of course is important; but this can be done naturally rather than in a formulaic way, if and when it feels appropriate. Being curious about the patient’s experience is key. How their symptoms affect them, what they mean to them, gives a deeper understanding. Patients are often just as interested in what the problem is, why it has happened and what is likely to happen, as any solutions I might try to suggest.
Has examination of the patient gone out of fashion?
I usually examine my patients whenever this is clinically appropriate. I don’t know how I am supposed to know if someone’s pain is lumbar, hip or trochanteric for instance, if I don’t examine them. It surprises me when patients say that this is the first time that they have been examined in such a situation. The laying-on of hands is something we are allowed to do in our privileged role as doctors, and it can be a powerful way of reassurance, and helping the patient feel that they are being taken seriously and it may be clinically useful too, of course.
Has examination of the patient gone out of fashion? I usually explain what I am doing as my patient might not realise. A close relative had to be examined by a Professor in London, and he lifted up her top without warning and exclaimed: “It’s hard to tell anything through this flab!” She was not impressed. In fact, she felt humiliated. Any kind of examination is an invasion of privacy and potentially embarrassing for the patient. They’ve probably decided to wear their best underwear if they think they need to be examined, and it’s important to be respectful and considerate and put them at their ease.
A bit of humour is fine. “You can take alcohol with those antibiotics if you wish, but no lager, it must be real ale!” Or if you support Arsenal you might need a stronger antibiotic! Nowadays, more often than not, the patient says they don’t drink alcohol. Or, when doing a urine dipstick test, I might comment that it looks like a chardonnay. I suppose others might suggest a darjeeling tea.
Summarising is important as it draws issues to a close, and it also allows the patient to feedback their ideas and concerns, particularly if I have missed something. This is part of shared understanding and a mutually agreed way forward can follow. Summarising is a useful technique if I feel lost as it allows me to collect my thoughts openly and the patient or I might choose to change direction. If the patient doesn’t buy into the plan, then they won’t agree to follow the plan.
The consultation may last only ten minutes and I am there to help my patient and they will decide at the end of the day whether they choose to take the tablet I have prescribed, or engage with a counsellor, or make lifestyle changes or whatever we have agreed. The patient is a partner in the consultation and they need to be involved in decisions. If I were in my patient’s shoes, would I follow my advice? A shared management plan involves respecting the patient’s autonomy. Sometimes I find some personal disclosure helpful. I don’t try and force statins on patients, but I might say that I take them myself and the conversation becomes more adult to adult than parent to child as we look together at the computer’s 10-year risk estimation and weigh up what it really means.
One of the fun bits of general practice is getting to know your patients as people. This fosters some brief conversation beyond what they came about. If I know my patient follows Arsenal, for instance, I might bemoan the fact that they always seem to win against my team, Everton. If they follow Watford or Southampton, then the reverse applies; all good fun. Knowing that a young person is embarking on a degree course, previously recorded in the reminders section seen only by me, then I can enquire about their progress. The little bit of informal conversation may help them to see their doctor as a human being who has a genuine interest in them and that seems to me to be a good thing.
Reaching out from one human being to another, is the stuff of general practice.
Closing the consultation seems to be a challenge for some trainees. This is problematic if you haven’t dealt with the patient’s problems and an unwillingness to leave the room is a sure-tell sign. Sometimes the patient might not leave because the prescription is still sitting on the printer and they have to remind me to sign it and give it to them. Memory lapses can affect doctors too.
Building rapport, connecting, establishing a relationship, knowing your patient as a person, all this sounds like jargon, but it is at the heart of being a GP and the bit that I enjoy. Trying to understand what it feels like to be a distressed teenager, a young parent with an ill child, or someone who has been bereaved. Knowing that my patient was widowed a year ago allows me to make a gentle enquiry as to how they are getting on, sometimes almost unsaid but communicated simply, that reaching out from one human being to another, is the stuff of general practice.

Video consultations: a guide for practice
by BJGP Life | Coronavirus | 0
Many practices are now using or considering using alternatives to face-to-face consultations because of concerns about Covid-19. Important new information and guidance is now available to support video consultations. Produced by researchers at the University of Oxford, the document covers five key topics. When are video consultations appropriate, how can a practice get ready for them, how can clinicians conduct high-quality video consultations, what can patients do to prepare for and take part in them, and what is the research evidence for their quality and safety?

As President of the BMA, Professor Pali Hungin launched a project to look into the impact of fast moving technological advances, the shifting role of the doctor, the adequacy of medical education, the nature of public and patient expectations of clinicians, the need for visionary medical leadership, and the well-being of clinicians themselves.

Women in medicine: increasing in numbers but not regard
by Emily Bailey | Opinion | 0
Throughout the last century we have witnessed major advancements for women in the UK, but gender inequalities continue to exist in the workplace. The NHS, established with the intent to treat everyone equally, is no exception. On average, female GPs — who now make up more than half of our workforce — continue to feel undervalued, hold less senior roles, and receive lower pay when compared to men.

My first year as a GP physician associate
by BJGP Life | Opinion | 0
When I first qualified as a physician associate (PA), I had no intention to work in general practice, at least until later in my career. I was unsure of the impact a PA could have in a GP setting prior to the much anticipated statutory regulation and associated prescribing rights. Having a physician associate within the practice has meant greater accessibility to appointments, less pressure on the on-call doctor, and improved prescribing rates in certain areas.

Well, not if you’ve chosen to pursue a career in general practice. Whilst my colleagues were preparing evidence of their accomplishments and practising expected questions, I was revising for the entrance exam and practising OSCE based scenarios. So why is the entry to GP training so different, and what does that mean for the specialty?

Research priorities in primary care: ideas from the coal-face
Posted by BJGP Life | 11 Sep 2018 | Research, Scholarship | 0
Setting research priorities in primary care: a co-creation symposium to generate ideas from the coal-face
Written by Victoria Tzortziou Brown, Clare Wilkinson, Kamal Mahtani, Geoff Wong, Azeem Majeed, Philip Evans, Thomas Round, and Roger Jones
Background
Although over 90% of patient contacts within the NHS occur in primary care, many of the interventions used in this setting frequently lack a sound, up-to-date, scientific basis.1Primary care research: The MRC’s proposals. G., Radda. 426: 872 British Journal of General Practice , 1998, Vol. 48. The applicability of research findings and relevant guidelines to front-line primary care practice is increasingly being questioned.2A review of clinical practice guidelines found that they were often based on evidence of uncertain relevance to primary care patients. N Steel et al. 11:1251-1257 Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, 2014, Vol. 67. Additionally, there seems to be a mismatch between what patients and clinicians want to see researched and the research that is actually being carried out.3Patients’, clinicians’ and the research communities’ priorities for treatment research: there is an important mismatch. Crowe S, Fenton M, Hall M, Cowan K, Chalmers I. Research Involvement and Engagement, 2015, Vol. 1.
There is an increasing recognition that research questions should be generated with input from front-line clinicians and patients and a shift is needed from a unidirectional connection between research and practice to a bi-directional one.4Evidence Generating Medicine: Redefining the Research-Practice Relationship to Complete the Evidence Cycle. Embi PJ, Payne P. S87-S91, Medical Care, 2013, Vol. 51.
The Intervention
The purpose of the Symposium was to bring together front-line primary care professionals (including GPs, Practice Managers, Nurses and Allied Healthcare Professionals) as well as NHS commissioners and Academics to generate ideas for primary care research.
The idea was discussed with colleagues from the NIHR HTA Primary Care Panel and the RCGP Clinical Innovation and Research Centre (CIRC) teams and a novel approach was developed that had the potential to facilitate the identification of evidence gaps.
The first stage of the intervention included an online survey which invited participants to reflect on their every-day practice and submit their research ideas online.
The second phase was the Symposium itself which took place at the Royal College of GPs. This incorporated an interactive session which covered the importance of bridging the gap between evidence and practice, the process from research idea to research commissioning and the basic steps of formulating research questions. The interactive session was then followed by facilitated round-table discussion using a semi-structured approach during which delegates went through a process of developing and prioritising research questions.
Significance and potential of the symposium
The Symposium provided a unique opportunity for primary care researchers, front-line professionals and commissioners to identify gaps in current evidence base and formulate key themes for primary care research.
The survey generated 44 research ideas. Respondents included GPs, nurses, physiotherapists, data analysts, commissioners and administrators at GP practices.
The Symposium was attended by 50 frontline healthcare professionals across a wide range of disciplines. It generated 15 additional research questions with themes around end of life, technology, mental health and staff wellbeing. These were prioritised by delegates.
The themes identified have been shared with relevant stakeholders and will be considered by the NIHR HTA Primary Care Panel during their research theme identification process.
We are working with relevant stakeholders so that the Symposium can become an annual event which will offer an opportunity for frontline professionals to shape the type of research commissioned for policy and applied healthcare provision and will assist towards bridging the gap between research, commissioning and clinical practice.
Acknowledgements
The Symposium was funded by NIHR and organised by QMUL, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry in collaboration with members of the NIHR HTA Primary Care panel and the RCGP Clinical Innovation and Research Centre (CIRC) teams.

Inspiring healthy lives
Posted by BJGP Life | 25 Oct 2019 | Opinion | 0
Rachel Handscombe is a GP partner in Derbyshire. She is an activity enthusiast and is keen to share the benefits of exercise to those she meets.
I wore my 100 parkrun t-shirt to work today. I was curious as to what my patients would say. Rarely a week passes by without some comment about my weight or fitness. I greet my patients in the waiting room and walk the 15 metres or so to my room. I take ‘no wonder you are so fit’ or ‘you must walk miles in a day’ to be a bad prognostic marker. My favourite comment has been ‘you’ll cop it when you reach the menopause!’ So it was a surprise and a bit of a disappointment that no-one really seemed to notice.
My Facebook thread is scattered with posts from Joe Wicks and Rangan Chatterjee – amongst others. There are clips of different strengthening exercises, photos on the beach, adventures in the wild and a general portrayal of wellbeing. Maybe we too, could live satisfied, healthy lives if we followed what they do? Which makes me wonder how much of a role model are we as clinicians at the forefront of primary care? If we ‘advertised well-being’ or showed a little more of how we aim to live healthier lives, would that inspire our patients? Should I respond with more that a shrug and a smile when patients believe that a little walk to and from the waiting room is enough to keep me fit and well?
I bounded into a practice meeting, grinning from ear to ear about the ‘takeover’ parkrun event which I was organising.
I love the parkrun practice initiative. My experience is that exercise has vastly improved my health, my confidence, my sense of adventure, my friendships and my general levels of happiness. Did I mention the positive effects it’s had on helping me manage my stress? I’d go so far as to say I am evangelical about a bit of exercise. So it came as no surprise to my colleagues when I bounded into a practice meeting, grinning from ear to ear about the ‘takeover’ parkrun event which I was organising. My excitement levels were soon dampened when the majority of my team freely admitted that 5km – run or walk was really just a little out of their comfort zones.
I wish I’d had the ideas and drive of Paul Sinton-Hewitt – the founder of parkrun. I am astounded by the impact he has had on the wellbeing of our nation(1). He has to be one of the most awesome health heroes of our time. My local parkrun has just celebrated its 10th birthday. There’s an average weekly attendance of 440 runners and over the last 10 years those runners have collaboratively run over a million kilometres. The average number of parkruns done by each runner is 8.9 so there must be something about parkrun that keeps people coming back for more. A staggering intervention but one that still seems so out of reach for many.
As a response to the disappointing turnout for my inaugural takeover parkrun, I have started a local couch to 5km (C25K) running group. There’s a brilliant C25K app that is free and takes participants from being able to run for a minute to being able to run continuously for 30 minutes. It’s a step up to being able to run 5km and after the nine-week course most of my C25K participants have proudly completed their first 5km- at the local parkrun. Hopefully many will now be embraced by the local parkrun community. My hope is that many will continue to run and experience for themselves the health benefits of exercise.
Many times, I’ve prescribed medication or referred for operations without really discussing lifestyle.
Many patients come to me looking for a ‘magic pill’ to make themselves feel better. Many times, I’ve prescribed medication or referred for operations without really discussing lifestyle. We have 1200 pre-diabetics in our practice. Each year we take their BMI, their BP and their Hbaic. Within a year, 5 to 10% of these patients are likely to be diabetic (3). On turning diabetic we start them on metformin. It’s not surprising that as physicians, we too are looking for a ‘magic pill’ – something that we can give to make a change within the time and financial constraints of our consultations. But ‘lifestyle intervention is the cornerstone of diabetes prevention with evidence of a 40-70% relative risk reduction’ (2).
So what if we did something differently? What if we inspired a new way of living? Instead of measuring decline could we refer our patients into a practice led C25K? Could each practice team take an hour out of their week to run – to improve their own health, but also to inspire and provide an accessible level of exercise and belonging into which patients can be embraced? Joe Wicks has turned his 1.9 million Instagram followers into a fitness empire. Rangan Chatterjee has sold over 200,000 books on living a healthier life. Perhaps it’s time to put on our trainers and role model a healthier way to live?
Now where is that parkrun t-shirt?

Living with breathlessness is hard
Posted by BJGP Life | 18 Jun 2019 | Research | 0
Dr Ann Hutchinson and Prof Miriam Johnson are researchers at the Wolfson Palliative Care Research Centre at the Hull York Medical School. They are on Twitter @AHutchinsonHull and @MJJohnson_HYMS
We know that living with breathlessness can be very difficult for both patients and their friends and family members.
Doing everyday things like cleaning and going shopping take a lot of effort. People may need help from others which can make them feel frustrated and down because they can’t do everything that they used to be able to.
“The emotional thing is extremely, extremely important. You don’t get the understanding… you can just like get caught up in a downward spiral and you end up in this little place all by yourself… ”
It can be hard for family members who can feel worried and isolated too.
“It ain’t just me; it’s my family as well, they have to go through it as well, people tend to forget them… they just think about the person whose got the illness, not the people they’ve got around them and it does affect them big time, they get emotional, they’re frightened.”
“We often feel lonely and on the edge of things.”
Breathlessness also makes people worried or frightened. At these times they need support from clinicians.
“I am all the time worried—worried when this breathing will attack me again.”
Bringing Breathlessness into View – a multimedia exhibition
We would like everyone to understand more about what it is like to live with breathlessness. We have worked together with people who experience daily breathlessness and local artists to make an exhibition called Bringing Breathlessness into View.
The exhibition has striking images and engaging sound recordings to help people understand what it is like to live with breathlessness. We hope visitors will find the exhibition thought provoking. Additionally, we are giving out information on how to live better with breathlessness so that people know there is something that can be done.
“I feel like Sleeping Beauty. The hedge has closed around me and I cannot do anything about it.”
These are three images from the exhibition to express both how difficult it is to live with breathlessness and also that it is possible to keep on going.
It is possible to keep going
Dr Dan Roper, GP and chair of NHS Hull CCG, who will be opening our exhibition in the British Lung Foundation’s Love Your Lungs week commented: “Breathlessness is a symptom of a wide range of medical conditions and it can be particularly challenging for people who live with it. It’s wonderful to see how art is helping to bring the voices of local people to light and share their stories in a way that both educates and inspires others. Breathlessness can be difficult, but there are ways to effectively manage the symptom and continue to lead a full life. It has been enlightening to support the recent research from the Hull York Medical School and we hope that their findings, along with the insights gleaned from this exhibit will help our clinicians offer the best care possible.”
There are things that can be done to help people live better with breathlessness
We want everyone to know that there are things that can be done to help people live better with breathlessness. There are many ways that patients can cope with breathlessness.
We have produced a booklet for patients and carers with practical things they can try to help them manage their breathlessness day to day, which can be downloaded from the Hull York Medical School website. This booklet incorporates information from the Cambridge Breathlessness Intervention Service. Further information is available from the British Lung Foundation website.
Many people find there are ways to cope with their breathlessness and have good lives. As one patient said:
“I’ve sort of changed my life. You can’t do the things you used to do, so you’ve got to say ‘‘well, okay, what can I do?’’ and do it.”
Clinicians can provide support and help people manage their breathlessness better. By focussing on breathlessness as a target for treatment in its own right, clinicians can support patients to adopt better self-management techniques so they can live well with breathlessness.
“She has got me organised and now I understand how the disease works. As a result, I have had a good summer. It makes me feel more resilient.”
To read more about our research and how clinicians can help people live well with breathlessness see our BJGP article.

Desperately seeking Plato
Posted by David Misselbrook | 17 May 2016 | Arts, International, Random | 0
We were in Athens with a couple of hours to kill. Acropolised out, too early for Ouzo. We had seen Socrates’ jail cell (almost certainly apocryphal).
We had seen the remains of Aristotle’s Lyceum, lovingly excavated. We had felt the weight of Pericles and the genius of Phidias. So we had a chance to check out an old rumour that the site of Plato’s academy was now marked only by a Texaco garage. (We had just found a Lidl on the site of the battle of Marathon, so who knows?) There it was on the map, “Plato’s Academy Archeological Park”, just a few miles out from the centre of Athens.
According to Alfred North Whitehead all philosophy is a series of footnotes to Plato. When my out of hours driver had been mind blown by the illusory world of “The Matrix”. I explained that this came from a two thousand year old thought experiment that we call Plato’s Cave. Suddenly my driver was interested in philosophy. Plato tackled the problems of perception and how we can (or cannot) know reality long before Descartes or Kant. He and a few mates created western thinking.
So we asked a taxi driver, gnarled as an ancient olive tree, to take us to Plato’s Academy. He looked confused. “But there’s nothing there.” We say that’s OK, we would just like to see the site and take some pictures. “Well, I haven’t been there for years” he said. We offer him our map, which he declines. We leave the tourist trail, driving through run down streets, the never ending layers of graffiti resembling Jackson Pollock’s stream of consciousness. A corner shop displays its stock of “Essex” washing powder, the finest goods on offer.
Unfortunately we have chosen a taxi driver straight from My Big Fat Greek Wedding. He explained all of Greek history with a running commentary on language and civilization, demonstrating exactly What The Greeks Did For Us, which by a remarkable coincidence turned out to be absolutely everything. Triangulating with what I already knew I reckoned about a third was approximately true, albeit exaggerated. We decided not to mention Lord Elgin.
We reached the area on the map. There was a post apocalyptic park of sorts. A couple of adjacent areas of worn and scrappy grass with a few dejected trees were surrounded by railings within what looked like a condemned South London Council Estate. We drove around randomly looking for something the driver recognized. There were no signs, no indication of an archeological site (surely the only square mile in Athens so deprived). The driver stopped to exchange enquiries with puzzled locals, none of who had ever heard of Plato and all of whom clearly wondered if we needed strong psychotropics.
We settled for jumping out of the taxi and taking random photos of the grass, concentrating on the occasional stone wall, which may or may not have been more than fifty years old. The driver became excited by some stone columns in a lock up yard, but on close inspection they were recent architectural salvage. However we found some overgrown stone ruins behind yet another fence, inaccessible and unlabeled. We declared these to be the ruins of Plato’s Academy, and duly photographed the hell out of them.
Driving off through the dystopian labyrinth we found a structure resembling a grey shipping container with the sign “Plato’s Academy Digital Museum”. It was locked. We walked round and found two elderly Greeks. “Come back tomorrow” they advised. A good suggestion except that by then we would be in France.
We drove back. So many shabby streets. We had not even found the Texaco garage. We heard more dodgy political theory than the whole of Plato’s Republic. How was it that this city, so full of ruins (and so full of itself) could not remember its greatest philosopher? We could find no trace of Plato. Not even a cave.
We sped back towards our hotel. Time for Ouzo and another view of the Acropolis.

Trainee notes: Life school
Posted by BJGP Life | 2 Mar 2016 | AiT, Opinion | 1
Aisha Yahaya is a GP ST2 with Imperial VTS who has an interest in effective communication with patients, writing and a yearly resolution to save her guitar from the dusty corner in which it sits.
Increasingly, I learn more about the way of the world by looking through the eyes of my patients.
As I reflect on my time spent in a large urban GP surgery, I share my feelings and what I learnt from the patient narrative.
Bravery, active listening and understanding. Very often, a patient will come with a problem that has troubled them for a while and their appointment with me is the first time they have mustered enough courage to seek help.
I was faced with this scenario when a patient told me they were uncomfortable with their identity and wanted to change this. In this case I learnt about bravery.
Patients take steps to help themselves by asking me for help or guidance. This is a sign of strength and it gives me a chance to empower them to take control of their health, wellbeing and happiness. I often expect patients to trust me easily and follow my advice, which makes me question why they would do so and how willing I would be to do the same if in their shoes.
I am aware of how perceptive patients can be of their doctor’s mood and a balance must be struck when navigating my feelings and theirs.
The difference between a successful or disastrous consultation could be the blank gaze I give a patient if my mind is elsewhere, compared with a simple nod of acknowledgement or the offer of a tissue when they are crying.
In a room with just the patient and me, there is nowhere to hide and this allows vulnerability to thrive.
In order to gain a patient’s trust I have found that putting them at ease and inviting open dialogue goes a long way. There is a reason why patient satisfaction questionnaires that are mostly aimed at a doctor’s attitude towards a patient rather than their breadth of knowledge, which of course goes without saying.
Bigger is not always better. I am sometimes disheartened when I feel I have not made a difference to my patient’s problem.
Despite this, I learnt that whatever the patient describes as a positive effect could be more important than what I think is significant or obvious. For example this could be the case of a simple lifestyle change in a patient with low mood or chronic disease. My GP trainer picked up on a management plan from my entry in a patient’s medical notes during a follow up appointment and asked the patient about it.
The plan was a single goal that the patient and I were confident they could achieve.
My trainer told me that the documentation and acknowledgement of this plan made the patient feel as though they had been listened to and taken seriously.
I find this encouraging and hopefully the patient felt as though they had genuine support from me and the other doctors.
My job as a GP trainee often doubles up as a life school where sometimes the most important lessons are learnt.
As always, I look forward to the next one.

Women in medicine: increasing in numbers but not regard
Posted by Emily Bailey | 8 Mar 2020 | Opinion | 0
Emily Bailey is a GPST2 in Lewisham. She has interests in clinical research, medical education and medical publishing, and is a Contributing Editor for BJGP Life.
In celebration of the 101st International Woman’s Day, 8th March 2020.
Throughout the last century we have witnessed major advancements for women in the UK, but gender inequalities continue to exist in the workplace. The NHS, established with the intent to treat everyone equally, is no exception. On average, female GPs — who now make up more than half of our workforce — continue to feel undervalued, hold less senior roles, and receive lower pay when compared to men. Thus, as a profession, our responsibility is no longer to improve access to medical school, but to ensure that the female workforce fulfils their potential once in employment, feels supported and appropriately financially remunerated whilst at work, and that women doctors are able to reach senior positions if they want to.
Despite women traditionally taking caring roles within society, it is only in recent years that they have been permitted to do so within a professional capacity. Elizabeth Garrett Anderson was Britain’s first formally qualified and recognised female doctor; she founded the New Hospital for Women in London in 1872 and four years later the Enabling Act formally allowed women to enter medical professions in England. Since then, the number of women entering medical school has increased significantly — 50 years ago women accounted for less than one fifth of the medical workforce and today they represent nearly half.(1) The medical profession may be the first previously male-dominated sector to achieve parity; the majority of qualified GPs are now female, and — following this trend — the majority of all doctors are soon set to be women.
Women more frequently experience harassment — both from patients and colleagues.
However, despite increasing numbers of women entering the profession, a government report in 2009 claimed that female GPs continue to be deprived of contractual rights, denied maternity support, and are missing out on leadership roles.(1) The British Medical Association has been accused of having an “old boys’ club network” culture which treats women as of less importance and ability. Following these claims, an investigation into sexist behaviour revealed that many female doctors feel “undervalued, ignored and patronised because they are women”(2). Women more frequently experience harassment — both from patients and colleagues.(3) It is imperative that capable and effective female GPs are not disadvantaged in this way, and that they can do their jobs without feeling underappreciated, subjected to unwanted sexual advances, or deprived of opportunities to reach positions of seniority.
Just under a third of consultants are female compared to more than half of training grade doctors and 40% of GP partners are female vs 68% of salaried GPs. There are fewer senior female clinical academics, for example Deans of medical schools, and while half of those who get doctoral degrees in the US and Europe are female, less than one in five are professors. Likewise, women continue to be under-represented in key medico-political roles.(4,5) One argument here is that more women work part-time, and it is difficult to be a part-time leader. They may lack the time necessary to invest in extracurricular CV-building activities alongside already busy clinical roles. The choice to work part-time may be influenced by societal expectations that women remain responsible for the majority of childcare commitments, household chores, and family duties. We are effectively now trying to maintain our old societal roles while fighting to have a chance at these new professional ones.(6)
The inequality in pay is likely to further damage the morale and motivation of our female workforce.
Repeated pay reviews highlight that female GPs earn less than male GPs — roughly 65p for every £1 earned by a man doing the same role. A gender pay gap remains even when controlling for those working part-time, and when taking into account whether someone is in a partnership or a salaried role. An argument has been made that women are less willing to negotiate a salary, or that they are perceived as less mobile — seen as tending to move home in line with their partner’s careers or children’s education which weakens their bargaining strength. The inequality in pay is likely to further damage the morale and motivation of our female workforce.
It has long been acknowledged that we need many more doctors, and we must be better at retaining those who are already trained. We invest nearly a quarter of a million pounds in training every doctor — we cannot waste these precious and limited resources.(1) With women set to represent the majority of GPs, we must ensure that they feel respected, valued and motivated. We must have a zero tolerance policy for verbal, physical and sexual harassment. We must make working patterns more flexible to ensure that all doctors can navigate their career alongside their other social roles as a parent or a partner. We must not financially penalise those who choose to have a family, or combine clinical work with other interests, and we must hold regular gender pay reviews to ensure that we close the gender pay gap. If we do not rectify these wrongs, we risk losing valuable and hard-working members of our already dwindling GP community.

A BJGP Christmas Carol: Part Five
Posted by BJGP Life | 21 Dec 2018 | Stories | 0
Peter Aird is a GP in Bridgwater, Somerset.
This is part five of a five part series. You can download the full five part version for free as an epub or mobi file for use with your Kindle or other e-reader.
Stave Five – in which we are given cause for hope
It was early morning when Scrooge woke. He sat up in bed and looked around the room. Everything appeared as normal and yet, within himself, he felt changed. Perhaps he was being naive but he felt a sense of optimism that he hadn’t known for years, daring to hope that things could get better.
It was then he remembered it was Christmas Day. ‘At least I think it is,’ he said to himself excitedly, ‘assuming that all three Spirits did indeed visit me last night and that I haven’t missed the great day completely.’ He ran to the window and looked out. A light layer of snow coated the ground which heightened his excitement still further.
And yes, a young lad was trying out a brand new bicycle, no doubt a freshly unwrapped Christmas present. Add to that the fact that one or two folk were making their way towards a church whose bells were ringing joyfully in the distance, it was, with the utmost certainty, Christmas morning.
But there was no time to lose. He had to check on Bob Cratchit. He dressed hurriedly and ran down the stairs and out into the crisp morning sunlight which reflected off the snow-covered ground. Scrooge got into his car and within a few minutes he was outside the house of his trainee. He knocked loudly on the door but there was no answer. He knocked again and, when there was no response, shouted through the letter box. Still there was only silence.
Scrooge moved round to the side of the house and looked through the same window he had the previous evening, its curtains still only partly drawn. Cratchit was sat there, just as he had been when Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Present had left him earlier. Scrooge hammered on the window until, at last, he saw movement and a wave of relief surged through him. Slowly Cratchit stood up.
‘Open up Bob. Open up this instant. Do you hear?’ Scrooge shouted at him though the glass. ‘Open up. It’s Christmas Day!’
Cratchit, clearly half asleep and still the worse for the half bottle of whisky he’d drunk the night before, gradually stood up and made his way to the front door. Scrooge had never been one for outward displays of affection, but now, as Cratchit opened the door, Scrooge greeted him with a hug that was as welcome as it was unexpected.
‘How are you Bob? Are you alright?’
‘I’ve a bit of a headache if I’m honest. And not one that’s improved any by all your hollering. But why are you here? Has something happened? Have I done something wrong?’
‘On the contrary. If anyone is at fault it’s me, for not appreciating you more. And to show you that I mean it, what do you say to a partnership come August when you’ve completed your training? I’d be proud to call you my partner.’
‘You must be desperate!’
‘Desperate? Of course I’m desperate! Have you seen the state of the health service? But that’s not the reason for my offering you a partnership. I would like you to help me change the way we do General Practice. It’s a conditional offer of course – conditional that is on you seeing some change. There’s no way I’d want you to commit to a lifetime of working the way we have of late.’
‘Well I guess I’ll have to think about it. But thank you. I didn’t realise that you thought I was up to the job.’
‘Of courses you’re up to the job. We all worry sometimes that we’re not though, so don’t be surprised if you find yourself questioning the fact – that’s normal! The trouble is that we’re all so anxious imaging that we have to be perfect. We’re not God you know – even though both the government and our patients sometimes expect us to act as though we were.’
‘Well I guess you’re right there.’
‘Of course I’m right, I’m your trainer! Now, what’s with the whisky and the packet of antidepressants?’
Cratchit looked down at the ground. ‘I didn’t take any, just thought about it. I guess I was just feeling a little overwhelmed. I was being stupid.’
‘It’s not stupid to feel overwhelmed. There’s no shame in being asked to do more than you can cope with. The only foolish thing is to not realise you need to say ‘No’ sometimes – that sometimes you need help and have to ask for it. I’ll try and make that easier for you from now on. Promise me though that you’ll not let your thoughts travel in such a dark direction again without letting me know.’
‘I’ll try not to – I promise.’
‘Excellent. Remember, we’re in this together.’
Cratchit couldn’t quite believe what he was hearing and couldn’t stop himself voicing the question that was on his mind.’
‘Dr Scrooge,’ Cratchit began.
‘It’s Ebenezer. Call me Ebenezer.’
Cratchit hesitated and then tried again. ‘Ebenezer,’ it seemed strange to hear the name spoken aloud, ‘I hope you don’t mind me saying this, but something seems different about you today. Has something happened?’
‘I rather think it has,’ said Scrooge. ‘As a profession we’re convinced everything’s wrong. A lot is of course, but I see now that if we can see what the problems are, then surely we stand a chance of making changes.’
‘But how?’
‘To be honest, I’m not quite sure. One thing would be our need to challenge the idea that medicine has all the answers. We need to say ‘No’ to the over-medicalisation of life and be honest with both ourselves and our patients as to what we can and can’t do. Another thing would be that we have to be allowed to behave as the professionals we were trained to be. Once we were seen as people who could be trusted to make judgments in the best interests of patients. Now it seems we are seen as mere service providers, required to unquestionably follow guidelines regardless of how appropriate or otherwise that might be.’
‘It’s as if we’re not considered competent to try to decide what is best for our own individual patients. But one size doesn’t fit all. And so we need to fight to retain the doctor patient relationship that underpins good general practice and not allow it to be lost in the rush to conveyer belt medicine. We have to take back control over our work, make our own decisions as to how to apply medical knowledge to each individual situation and have the courage to resist the inappropriate demand to behave in ways that are imposed on us by government, pharmaceutical companies and society as a whole.’
‘That would mean better health for our patients and happier working lives for ourselves. That’s something I can aspire too, and knowing what it is I’m aiming for might just give me a chance of fathoming out how I might go about working towards it. At least, that’s my hope.’
Scrooge, in his excitement, had been pacing around the room. Now, pausing for breath, he sat down.
‘But that’s enough of all that for now. We can get together tomorrow and plan then just how exactly we’re going to do things differently. We’ll call it a practice away day. Just think of all the CPD hours we can claim! So, what are your plans for today?’
‘Well I had planned on a spot of revising for the CSA.’
‘Revising for the CSA. What nonsense – you’d pass that tomorrow with your eyes closed. Like it or not, you’re spending the day with me! We’ll have dinner at my house. I ordered a lorry load of food from Waitrose last week and there’s no way I can manage it all on my own. In fact there’s more than enough for two. Quick, go and get yourself sorted out. I’ve got an idea – one that might, for the first time in my career, satisfy my appraiser that my reflections have altered my practice!’
It wasn’t long before Cratchit was sat in the passenger seat of Scrooge’s car wondering where Scrooge might be taking him. A few minutes later they pulled up outside a block of flats and Scrooge led the way up the steps to the second floor. He knocked on a door.
‘Who lives here?’ asked Cratchit.
‘Mrs Gray. She’s lived here alone since her husband, Timothy, died a few years ago. He was a short man. He had some kind of growth hormone deficiency I believe.’
Eventually, the door opened, and Mrs Gray stood there, evidently astonished to see her GP.
‘Good morning Mrs Gray. And a very merry Christmas to you.’
‘Well a very merry Christmas to you too Dr Scrooge. But what brings you here? Is it about the chocolates?’
‘Certainly not. We, that’s Dr Cratchit and I, have come to pick you up and take you off to my house for Christmas Day. What do you say? Will you come?’ Mrs Gray hesitated, uncertain if she should.
‘Please come, Mrs Gray. It would mean a lot to me.’
‘But I’ve nothing to bring.’
Scrooge looked over her shoulder and saw the box of chocolates on the kitchen table. ‘What about those?’ Scrooge asked, ‘You don’t have to bring anything, but if you’d like to make a contribution…’
‘But I’m pre-diabetic Dr Scrooge, I need to be careful what I eat.’
‘Who told you that?’ said Scrooge, a broad grin forming on his face. ‘Not a doctor I hope. Believe me Mrs Gray, you shouldn’t believe everything we doctors tell you!’
With that, Mrs Gray tottered to the kitchen, picked up the chocolates and made her way back to the front door. Then, together with Scrooge and Cratchit, she made her way slowly down the stairs. Halfway down, Scrooge stopped.
‘You go on Bob, I’ll catch you up in a moment. It’s just that I have a feeling that, as a GP, I am, for once, ideally positioned to reduce hospital admissions.’
He ran back up the stairs and knocked on the door of the flat opposite that of Mrs Gray. A man opened the door.
‘I don’t want to appear interfering,’ Scrooge began, ‘but your son will develop a rash later this morning. When he does, try wiping it off with a damp cloth. Trust me, I’m a doctor!’
With that Scrooge turned and headed off back down the stairs leaving the man speechless behind him.
—
A couple of hours later, the two doctors and their elderly patient sat around a dining table enjoying
Waitrose’s finest. As the meal drew to a close, Cratchit turned to Scrooge.
‘I think I’ve made my decision’ he said.
‘What decision is that?’
‘I’d like to accept your offer of a partnership, if I pass the CSA that is.’
‘That’s wonderful Bob, simply wonderful!’ Scrooge stood up and shook Crachit warmly by the hand and then, for the second time in the day, embraced him warmly. ‘This is excellent news – for me and for the practice. We should organise a party!’
Scrooge dashed out of the room and returned with a sheet of paper on which were listed all the practice staff, their names and telephone numbers.
‘And a party we shall have,’ declared Scrooge handing the list to Cratchit. ‘Start ringing round and invite anyone who’s free to join us here this evening. Perhaps someone will bring some of those Prosecco and pink peppercorn Pringles – are they really a thing? Only don’t let me drink too much. The last time I did that there was an incident at a local supermarket, the details of which you don’t want to know!’
‘Can I say something Dr Scrooge?’ Scrooge turned around and saw that Mrs Gray had got to her feet. With one hand she steadied herself by holding onto the table and with the other she was holding a glass of wine. ‘I’ve had a lovely time today and I want to thank you for all your kindness. I’d like to propose a toast, to both of you, the practice, and the NHS as a whole. It’s something my late husband used to say.’ She raised her glass higher. ‘God bless us, every one,’ she said.
‘God bless us, every one,’ repeated Scrooge and Cratchit, smiling as they raised and carefully tapped together their glasses.
—
In time, Cratchit passed his CSA and joined Scrooge in partnership and when Scrooge came to retirement he did so reluctantly. He considered himself to have been a fortunate man to have had the career he did. Cratchit continued on, the practice grew and new partners were appointed. Though their processes and procedures didn’t always meet with the full approval of the CQC, the partners always enjoyed strong support from their practice population.
Scrooge’s experiences that night may not have changed the state of the NHS as a whole, but they did change how the NHS was manifested in one small corner of that great organisation. Scrooge never had any further encounters with spirits – he had no need of them. Afterwards it was always said of him that he was a doctor who cared for his patients more than he cared how he was thought of by people in power and that he knew how to support others and how he needed support of others himself. May that be truly said of us all.
And so, as Mr Gray observed, ‘God Bless Us, Every One!’

Introducing GPs Anonymous
Posted by Peter Aird | 13 Jan 2015 | Opinion, Political, Random | 0
Peter Aird is a GP in Bridgwater, Somerset.
Is it just me or is being a GP increasingly being portrayed as something for which one ought to be ashamed? If so, then perhaps we should consider if we need some help.
With the latest suggestion that patients will be able to bypass their GP and refer themselves for cancer investigations, perhaps it’s time to face up to an uncomfortable truth. We’ve been told enough times by enough people – perhaps the implication is true: we’re not up to the job. It’s all the fault of we GPs.
We mustn’t
go on denying it any longer – convincing ourselves we’re OK – after all, until we acknowledge our problem how can we expect anything to be done to help us. We will just go on making everyone’s life a misery.
We all know how embarrassing GP behaviour can be – you know the kind of thing, spoiling everything for everybody on Christmas Day by turning up at a family gathering rather than opening our surgeries as normal – and thereby compelling people to waste hours in A&E departments with their sore throats and itchy toes. And then, of course, there is the wilful ignoring of our patients who clearly have cancer whilst, at the same time, putting an unnecessary burden on secondary care services by admitting patients to hospital just for the fun of it.
So let’s all face up to our problem. I’ll go first by introducing myself:
My name is Peter – and I’m a General Practitioner.
There that wasn’t so bad -to be honest it’s a relief to have it out in the open – I hope you can find it in your heart to accept someone as shameful as me – after all the hurt I’ve caused. If you’re similarly afflicted, come and join me – I’m setting up ‘GPs Anonymous’ in the hope that together we can support all of us who are stricken with the affliction that is ‘being a GP’.
But perhaps you’re still unconvinced you have a problem. Can I urge you then to ask yourselves these four screening questions? Answer two in the affirmative and you may have a problem – answer ‘Yes’ to all four and you’re in real trouble.
C – have you ever felt you wanted to cut down how much general practice you do?
A – have you ever been annoyed by criticism of your actions as a GP?
G – have you ever felt guilty for what you have done as a GP?
E – have you ever started early in the morning doing your ‘GP thing’?
Extra phone lines will be installed should demand for this new service prove overwhelming.
[bctt tweet=”BJGP Blog: Peter Aird is joining GPs Anonymous. Try the CAGE questionnaire.”]
So why do people fall into the destructive behaviour patterns of general practitioners? Well there seems to be a genetic component in some cases – seeing your parents behaving as GPs seems to predispose some to follow a similar path – though, thankfully this is becoming less common. Others experience a little bit of general practice early on in their medical career and naively imagine that it’s a good thing – something they can control. After all, just one attempt at a ten minute consultation can’t hurt can it? But before long they’re out of control – only in it for the extortionate pay, long hours of ‘off duty’ and the kicks one gets from the systematic mismanagement of those who thought they were there to help.
It’s a tragic condition but, with the arrival of ‘GPs Anonymous’ at last there is some real hope for change. Perhaps together we can rid the country of the blight that GP’s have become.
And then won’t everyone be happy?

The Twitter GP Journal Club relaunch #gpjc
Posted by BJGP Life | 1 Aug 2018 | GP Journal Club | 0
In 2011, a Cambridge medical student and a foundation programme doctor working in the West Midlands founded the first ever Twitter journal club (@twitjournalclub/#twitjc). Within weeks they had close to a thousand followers. There are now 59 journal club Twitter hashtags, although not all of these are active, including @twitjournalclub which became inactive in December 2013.
@GPJournalClub (#gpjc) was founded in December 2015 by Lucy Pocock (@drpoco), who was at the time a GP registrar on maternity leave. The account had 100 followers within 24 hours and now has over a thousand. The first tweet chat took place on 10th January 2016 and had 25 participants. Monthly tweet chats then followed, supported by the BJGP Blog, until March 2017. Juggling being a new GP, and relatively new mum, Lucy found that she had little time to devote to running the journal club and it became increasingly difficult to recruit willing volunteers to co-chair the tweet chats.
On Sunday 9th September 2018 at 7.30pm, @GPJournalClub will relaunch with Dr Shibley Rahman (@dr_shibley) in the hot seat, selecting a paper and co-chairing the discussion.
In order to create a more sustainable future for @GPJournalClub Lucy, now a School for Primary Care Research GP Career Progression Fellow, is looking for volunteers to be part of a management group. This is a role that would particularly suit academic GP trainees and would look great on a CV!
If you are interested, please contact her on Twitter (@drpoco) or via email (lucy.pocock@bristol.ac.uk).

The impact of BJGP’s research on clinical practice
Posted by BJGP Life | 18 Feb 2020 | Video | 0
The British Journal of General Practice is a leading international primary care journal, publishing high-quality research with clinical impact worldwide. Here we highlight some recent papers and their clinical impact.
1. Detecting multiple myeloma
Koshiaris et al. Universities of Oxford and Exeter, UK. For unexplained back, rib, and chest pain, fatigue, and recurrent chest infection, simple blood tests of plasma viscosity and ESR can rule out myeloma or indicate urgent testing.
IMPACT ON PRACTICE: Faster diagnosis, faster treatment
https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp18X698357
2. Avoiding unnecessary thyroid tests
Roberts et al. Universities of Warwick, Bristol, Birmingham, and Oxford, UK. Patients over 65 with a normal thyroid function test in the last 5 years are not recommended for routine repeat thyroid testing unless clinically indicated.
IMPACT ON HEALTH CARE: Reduced workload, patient convenience, cost savings
https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp18X698861
3. Recognising testicular cancer
Shephard and Hamilton, University of Exeter, UK. Additional risk symptoms for testicular cancer include testicular pain associated with groin pain and blood tests showing inflammation.
IMPACT ON PRACTICE: Lower thresholds for urgent referral and earlier diagnosis
https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp18X697949
4. Detecting atrial fibrillation
Cole et al. Barts and the London School of Medicine, UK. More than 2000 strokes could be prevented each year in the UK with simple routine pulse checks for AF.
IMPACT ON PRACTICE: Minimal investment with life-saving results
https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp18X696605
5. Cancer safety netting
Nicholson et al. Universities of Oxford, UK; Aarhus, Denmark; and Lund, Sweden. Systematic follow up and ‘double safety netting’ are needed to prevent cancer patients from slipping through the net.
IMPACT ON PRACTICE: Unrecognised cancers will not be missed
https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp18X695813
6. Extending prescription length
King et al. RAND Europe, Cambridge, UK. Prescriptions longer than 28 days for patients with stable chronic conditions can improve adherence.
IMPACT ON PRACTICE: Drug effectiveness, patient convenience, reduced workload
https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp18X695501
7. Investigating weight loss
Nicholson et al. Universities of Oxford and Exeter, UK. Weight loss is a red flag for cancer, and is the second highest risk factor for colorectal, lung, pancreatic, and renal cancers.
IMPACT ON DIAGNOSIS: Increased awareness should lead to faster diagnosis
https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp18X695801
8. Responding to maternal non-attendance
Lyngsøe et al. Aarhus University, Denmark. Non-attendance at child health checks may signal maternal depression.
IMPACT ON HEALTH: Potential for earlier detection of mental health problems
https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp18X694565
9. Shortening antibiotic treatment for sore throat
Moore et al. University of Southampton, UK. A 5-day course of antibiotics appears to be as effective as a 10-day course for suspected streptococcal sore throat.
IMPACT ON PRACTICE: Reduced costs and reduced antibiotic resistance
https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp17X692333
10. Prescribing exercise for postnatal depression
Pritchett et al, University of Birmingham, UK. Exercise is effective in reducing postpartum depressive symptoms. It is also a potential preventive measure in postpartum women.
IMPACT ON PRACTICE: Non-pharmacologic treatment, with additional health benefits
https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp17X692525
11. C-reactive protein and acute cough
Cals and Ebell, Universities of Maastricht, The Netherlands, and Georgia, US. C-reactive protein testing in primary care helps to guide prescribing decisions for acute cough in adults.
IMPACT ON PRACTICE: More accurate diagnosis, fewer antibiotic prescriptions
https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp18X694901

The importance of self care for GPs: tackling burnout through comedy
Posted by BJGP Life | 19 May 2016 | Arts | 0
Ahmed Z Kazmi is a doctor and stand-up comedian. If you would like to see his show ‘Doctor in the House’ he will be performing at Brighton Fringe 20-24th May 2016, Hollywood Fringe 19th-26th June 2016 and Edinburgh Fringe Festival 4-14th August 2016. For lots more information and to purchase tickets please go to www.doctorahmed.net
At my medical school interview I was asked what I did to relax, I remember thinking that was an odd question. My GP training curriculum included lectures entitled ‘How to avoid burn out’ and I remember sighing and rolling my eyes. It was not until I was in the role of qualified GP for some time that I started to feel a drain on my wellbeing. Then in 2015 my father died from cancer and I really struggled to remain the empathetic and attentive doctor I had prided myself on being. The presence of grief and mourning added an additional ball to the juggling act of clinical duties, professional development tasks, administrative tasks, family and friend obligations and the banal tasks of daily living, and I found myself struggling. I suddenly saw the relevance of the question asked of me at my medical school interview and the rationale for the lecture on burn.
I think it is fair to say general practice is a high intensity occupation. The high volume of patient contacts per day plus the short consultation duration coupled with often unrealistic patient expectations create a sense of panic and unrest during the working day. The relatively frequent rearrangement of service structure and health policy combined with a constant media flurry around the NHS and general practice can produce for many GPs a gloomy atmosphere within which to work. This environment was sadly a contributing factor in my decision to move from the UK in 2014 and practice in Australia.
As mentioned earlier, it was not until last year that the importance of non-academic outlets and self care became evident to me. I used to consider exams or diplomas or courses a leisurely parallel to my role as a GP. I loved to learn, enjoyed keeping up to date and saw an update course as a luxury activity. With social media being inundated constantly with healthcare politics I found myself almost totally unable to switch off from the job, even in my personal time,
and for the first time decided to temporarily reduce my working hours and take up a hobby unrelated to my vocation. But alas the apple never falls far from the tree. I decided to try my hand at stand up comedy (not after an unsuccessful attempts at becoming a pole dancer and instagrammer respectively) and quickly had to embrace that my work as a GP was in fact my largest source humour. I decided to make a stand up show about the funny side of being a doctor. I wished to create something that would be playful and entertaining whilst remaining respectful to patients and the profession. I took a few months to write and rehearse the cabaret comedy show ‘Doctor in the House; What your doctor really thinks’ and made my comedy debut at the Perth Fringe Festival in February 2016. All my shows sold out and I received positive reviews from critics, colleagues and spectators. I managed to raise over $5000 AUS for a local cancer charity from ticket sales and donations. In addition to this I used the show as a vehicle for some more serious subtexts including patient responsibility, cancer awareness and bereavement. Above all the experience did renew my empathy and interest in my vocation.
The experience taught me that even in this current climate we can create opportunities for fun and laughter around our work. It is all too easy to become stationary in a vehicle stuck in mud where the wheels are turning but the car is not moving forward. Several of my friends had hobbies during medical school: music, art, fitness but sadly these were made redundant as general practice and family pressures grew. I would encourage the reader to gently reflect on the following questions:
Do you feel content at work?
Do you feel you are nearing burn out?
If you are content, well done, how can you ensure that continues? If not how might you address it?
Think of one or two hobbies/interests/activities (big or small!) you would like to do more of or have never tried and would like to sample.
Lastly think about how you might actually start to undertake the activity and create room for it in your life.
I am not suggesting everyone take a four month sabbatical and go on a world fringe festival tour of their solo stand-up comedy show… But I think now more than ever it is imperative for GPs to become good at self-care. Yoga? Swimming? Mindfulness meditations? Reduction in sessions? Cookery class? Or, yes, even stand-up comedy. What would you say to your patient in a similar position, need I say more!

RCGP Conference 2015: Stephen Bergman on good patient care
Posted by BJGP Life | 2 Oct 2015 | Arts, Opinion | 0
Stephen Bergman is a doctor, novelist and playwright. He is currently a Clinical Professor of Medicine in Medical Humanities and Ethics at New York University Medical School. His book, The House of God, published in 1978, is firmly established in medical culture and deservedly has wider ‘cult classic’ status.
In 1971, I wrote this piece, and recently have looked back at it. In a sense it has all the things I’ve learned since, and that every good General Practitioner learns. I give a little current comment on what in fact I have learned, at the end.
THE PATIENT IS THE WORLD
Samuel Shem
Medical students in their course on diagnosis are taught: “When you hear hoof beats outside the window don’t assume it’s a zebra.” This means that you should think of common diseases first, not exotic ones. Decades ago when I was a medical student in Boston at one of man’s greatest hospitals, I was assigned a woman with “difficulty breathing.” She was 56 years old, a mother of three whose husband had died two years before. In good health all her life, she worked in a flower shop. She had never before had trouble breathing. Her husband’s death had been a shock, but with the support of friends and family she had gotten through it pretty well. The resident—my boss—came in and took his history, in a rat-a-tat technique of asking a probing question which had to be answered yes or no, and as soon as there was a response, cutting her off and moving on to the next—I knew he was filling in his grid, a decision tree that would provide the diagnosis. No new information came up. Physical exam showed nothing but her panting. Lab work revealed increased eosinophilia, the blood cell that increases when the body is allergic to something. The resident went back and grilled her on allergies. Nothing.
Her workup proceeded in classic academic fashion, with increasingly refined blood tests and X-rays. The latter showed a diffuse pattern of lung irritation, but no lesions or tumors. Experts were called in, and each diagnosed something in their area of expertise, from the psychiatrist diagnosing “melancholia” at her husband’s death, to the surgeons wanting to cut. She kept getting worse, the oxygen levels in her blood falling lower and lower, blueing her lips, paling her face. A look of doom seemed to cloud her eyes. The surgeons did a lung biopsy which showed only that her lung was reacting to some antigen, as the blood test had shown.
She continued to decline. Palliative treatment was begun. The resident and staff doctors seemed reluctant to enter her room. I felt scared for her and sorry, and spent more and more time sitting with her, just talking—a medical student has time for this arcane procedure. One day I asked where she lived. She said that after her husband died she’d taken in boarders to survive. I asked about them. “One of them’s…a real trip,” she gasped. “A magician.” I smiled and asked more about him. Part of his act involved trained pigeons, which he kept in cages in the basement. “The cages are right above my washer drier.” My ears perked up. It turned out that whenever she ran the drier, the pigeon droppings were aerosolized and she breathed them in—for the past two years. I rushed to the medical library—in those days we still used books—and found “Pigeon Breeder’s Lung Disease.” Treatment: get rid of the pigeons; and a course of steroids. Prognosis: excellent. The magician suffered. She got well.
Looking back now, what did I learn?
That the science of medicine is astonishing and useful, but it can keep us from practicing the human art of listening and responding, face to face, heart to heart, without a decision tree in mind or a computer on our laps so we stare into the screen instead of look into the eyes, all to “save time”. That the for-profit insurance industry dictates that we doctors don’t have time to listen to our patients if we want to get paid. That if we rely on technology and tests and neglect “being with” the patient, we may well miss the vital human facts that will solve the mystery and bring the cure. And that the patient is never only the patient, the patient is the spouse (alive or dead), the family, the house and who lives in it, the friends, the community, the toxins, the climate, where the water comes from and where the garbage goes. The patient is the world.
And finally that the “hoof beats” outside the window can be zebras—or, if you listen carefully, just the light steps of a common bird.
What I’ve learned since
I’ve learned that the delivery of good medical care is based on understanding, and communicating with the patient, the risk of isolation, and the healing power of good connection. Doctors now are into their screens, and the best ones are those who can type without looking at the keyboard. The real issue in caring for the patient based on two things:
Connection comes first: if you are in good connection, you can talk about anything; if you’re not in good connection, you can’t talk about anything (this, of course applies to life outside medicine—thnk of your spouse or partner).
It’s never only what you do or say, it’s what you do or say next. No one ever gets connection right all the time, we are always getting it wrong, mostly in little ways. The ones who are great with patients—and with spouses,
partners etc—are those who, when there’s a disconnect, note it, hold it with the other person, and then do something next to turn it into a better connection.
Good relationship, good connection, is the key to good patient care.
And GPs are lucky—you get to actually be with patients in this way.

Diagnosing dementia in younger people: A decision-making guide for GPs

A typical story
“I knew something was wrong, I just didn‘t know what. Maybe it’s just me, I thought, maybe I’m a bit stressed.”
“I knew something was wrong, I just didn‘t know what. Maybe it’s just me, I thought, maybe I’m a bit stressed. I did have a lot on at work. I’d always been really on the ball and ahead of time but things were taking me twice as long, particularly when it came to writing anything. I simply couldn’t find the words, and those I could remember, I couldn’t spell anymore. I even forgot how to use the photocopier I’d used for years, it was so embarrassing. I began to gradually lose my confidence.
Life went on like this for over 2 years, with things becoming more and more difficult. It put particular strain on my relationships as I avoided going out anywhere, particularly somewhere new and seeing my friends became impossible as I struggled to follow the kind of conversations I had before. I inevitably became more isolated and was treated for depression for 6 months before I was referred to a memory clinic. In the end, my wife insisted on coming to see the GP with me. When he asked her what life was like she replied ‘It‘s like living with a 90 year old‘. I was only 49.
Although it sounds strange to say, being diagnosed was a bit of a relief. For a long time, I thought I was going crazy, but I finally had an explanation. I could now understand why I was experiencing symptoms that most people my age won’t ever experience. I describe my life now as ‘sunshine and clouds’. If the clouds appear, everyday life can be a bit tricky in that moment. Yet, when they clear, I make the most of it by doing the things I still enjoy – albeit with a bit of extra support! Whilst life can be challenging, I live everyday as it comes.”
Young onset dementia
Many people think of dementia as a disease of old age. How would it feel to be diagnosed with dementia in your 50s or even your 40s? There are 42,000 people with young onset dementia (YOD) in the UK (1). They experience symptoms of dementia under 65 years old and the time required to get a confirmed diagnosis can be long and frustrating. It takes almost twice as long to be diagnosed as someone with late onset dementia (LOD).
This equates to 4.4 years and research has highlighted the challenges ‘with almost three clinicians consulted […] before a diagnosis’ is made (2, 3).
How does young onset dementia present?
Symptoms of YOD manifest themselves differently, making dementia in younger people more difficult to diagnose (4). Behaviours such as confusion and forgetfulness are often incorrectly put down to symptoms of stress, depression, or the menopause in women (5). Those with YOD frequently have less common forms of dementia such as familial Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia, with behavioural and language changes sometimes the first noticeable symptoms (4,6).
People with YOD are of working age, often living physically active lives, many with dependent children and financial commitments, making diagnosis dramatically life changing. Recognition and diagnosis are the first essential steps not only to enable access to treatment, but to support younger people to live well with dementia.
Young Dementia UK and a guide for GPs
Young Dementia UK is a charity that exists for one reason – ‘to help people whose lives are affected by young onset dementia’ (1) In collaboration with GPs, the Young Dementia Network – a community of people living with YOD, their friends and family,
as well as professionals who work in dementia and social care – have developed a decision-making guide for GPs centred on ‘diagnosing dementia in younger people’.
The charity believes the guide will increase the awareness of GPs on the wide-ranging symptoms of this relatively rare condition and will support conversations on the subject between GPs and their patients. The first version of the guide was created in early 2017 and was piloted online for 4 months. Over 70 feedback surveys about the guide were received from GPs, health and social care professionals, and people living with YOD and their families. Following this, the guide was amended, and the updated version is now available online.
The guide acknowledges that picking up the symptoms and signs of YOD is not easy and can, at times, be based on gut feeling.
Dr Jill Rasmussen, who is a GP in Surrey and Clinical Representative for Dementia at the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), reviewed the guide. She commented, “It is early days yet but Commissioners are beginning to appreciate that their pathway for dementia patients needs to consider the needs of YOD” and also a subset of this group, people with Learning Disabilities, of which “50% will develop dementia by age 60”.
Dr Rasmussen has approached NHS Digital to see if research can be undertaken nationally to look at how effective the guide has been in increasing the rates of diagnosis and referral but suggests that more needs to be done. In particular, she would like to see more help for GPs with “a reference person in each Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP) or Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) to whom they can address questions”.
Fundamentally, the guide acknowledges that picking up the symptoms and signs of YOD is not easy and can, at times, be based on gut feeling. This is reflected in the initial screening questions. The guide also encourages the involvement of family and friends who can help to build a better picture of the symptoms patients are experiencing and how their life is affected.
Examples of symptoms and the ways in which they may manifest or prompt a visit to the doctor are included. These are grouped under useful headings and serve as visual reminders of the range of presentations, with memory and disorientation being just one of them. Before referring a patient to a young dementia service, the guide additionally highlights the need to consider other and possibly co-existing diagnoses in a holistic review.
This guide cleverly raises awareness and teaches GPs about YOD whilst addressing the needs of patients and family members. It is easy to follow, focusing both on the identification of ‘red flags’ but also the subtler signs and symptoms which can be insidious and are often only noticed by close relatives or friends. In the current climate where it can be difficult to see your preferred GP and with continuity of care becoming more difficult, the guide is a crucial tool to recognising the early changes in people with young onset dementia and helping people come to terms with their condition.

Review: A Fortunate Man
Posted by Roger Jones | 9 Feb 2015 | Arts, Opinion | 1
Professor Roger Jones is editor of the British Journal of General Practice.
A Fortunate Man: the story of a country doctor. John Berger and Jean Mohr. Canongate, London, 2015
First published in 1967, this is one of those must-read general practice books, essential for every trainer, trainee and practice library, and one, I suspect, which has been more frequently recommended than read. It has been re-issued this year in a new edition with an introduction by Dr Gavin Francis.
Anyone coming fresh to A Fortunate Man, expecting a paean to idyllic country general practice, will be disappointed, because the romanticised hero of John Berger’s extended essay is a deeply troubled individual to whom the epithet “fortunate” can be applied, at best, with irony.
Berger, now 88, is a distinguished critic and Booker Prize winner. He met the central character of the book, Dr John Eskell, as a patient in St Briavel’s, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, and became close friends with him. Eskell had been a Royal Naval surgeon during the war in the Mediterranean, and was now in single-handed practice following the death of his GP partner. Some time after Berger had left England for Geneva, Eskell, who becomes Dr John Sassall in the book, invited him and the photographer Jean Mohr to spend six weeks with his family and to shadow him round-the-clock in
his surgeries, on his many house calls and, presumably, in his domestic life, although this is not mentioned once In the book. Sassall was clearly a revelation to Berger, and the degree of connection, empathy, and acceptance that he showed to his patients, and the lengths that he went to, literally, to care for them are clearly regarded by Berger as both astonishing and exemplary. In describing Sassall’s actions and thoughts, and it is more often than not very difficult to know whether Sassall or Berger is doing the thinking, many of the core qualities and responsibilities of a general practitioner working in an isolated rural setting are perfectly captured.
However, Sassall’s hyper-commitment to his practice and his patients was, at least in part, a function of his manic-depression. Berger rather coolly describes Sassall’s lows, but doesn’t seem to quite understand the highs. Sassall’s wife, who ran his practice, died in 1981 and Sassall shot himself the following year. His professional life was troubled and he practised with little professional or, indeed, social contact. Whilst being admirably reflective and sensitive, he appeared to lack, or at least managed to avoid, any real recognition of his wider role as a general practitioner as an advocate for his practice population’s health or as a medical scientist. I can’t help making comparisons with Julian Tudor Hart, working wonders in Glyncorrwg, and John Fry laying the foundations of general practice research from his little practice in Beckenham.
I started reading this book 30-odd years ago and was put off by Berger’s often convoluted, freewheeling writing and Jean Mohr’s dreary photographs. I grew up in the Forest of Dean and, while recognising its comparative social isolation, bridled at Berger’s patronising depiction of Forest folk as uncultured half-wits, and still do. However, re-reading it at one sitting very recently, I recognised the limpid beauty of some of Berger’s prose, the subtlety of his descriptions of nature and of human interactions,
and his insights into the needs of ordinary people faced with illness, anguish and loss. His – or is it Sassall’s? – understanding of the role of the general practitioner as a witness and a “clerk of record”, needs to be widely understood, and never more so in these days of therapeutic miracles and performance indicators, when the unmeasurable essence of patient care can so easily be overlooked.

I have just finished reading ‘A Fortunate Man’ – literally fifteen minutes ago – and did a quick internet search as I wanted to find out whether others felt about it as I did. As an ordinary reader with no medical connections I felt that I was being made to feel inadequate, that I should have a great deal more knowledge of philosophy before I should allow myself to read it. I think quite genuinely that the unadorned story of his life among his community, although a very common subject, would have told us a great deal more about this dedicated doctor.
I suppose that what came over to me was that the book was far more about John Berger than it was about Dr Sassall. I wonder whether the reader is supposed to acknowledge Berger’s superior intellect, particularly when one compares it
to the low-brow status of the local hoi polloi. My impatience with John Berger reached a crescendo when I first realised how he despised the local people, how he suggested that a visit to the nearest town, or heaven forbid, to London, might be the highlight of their dull, plodding lives! The use of the generic description ‘foresters’ made me see red, reminding me of Hardy’s ‘The Woodlanders’.
No, all-in-all I closed the book with a feeling of anger, a feeling that Dr Sassall had been used by Berger as a vehicle for his own knowledge, his own views. Cynically, I wondered if this had anything to do with Sassall’s subsequent suicide! But having said that, there were many passages which I thoroughly enjoyed and seeking out one to copy into my book of quotations I chose ‘The privilege of being subtle is the distinction between the fortunate and the unfortunate’. It’s also fair to say that Berger did successfully convey to me the dedication and single-mindedness of the local family doctor and that alone would make the book worth the read.
As a keen amateur photographer however, I really couldn’t appreciate Jean Mohr’s photography. Some of the images did successfully illustrate the text – I particularly liked the out of focus figure leaving the consulting room on shown on page 52, which I felt put over well the comings and goings of all these anonymous people.
Otherwise I found his pictures dull and uninspiring, the sort of ‘rule-breaking’ that only a famous photographer could get away with!

Audio essay: My loss
Posted by BJGP Life | 22 Jul 2019 | Clinical | 0
Ahmeda Ali is a GP in Ireland.
Ahmeda’s essay was one of the Sheppard Memorial Prize winners at the Republic of Ireland Faculty Winter Meeting. An abridged version will be published in the BJGP and here we present the full essay with a reading from the author, Ahmeda.
https://bjgplife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ahmeda_Audio-FINAL.mp3
‘May the radiance and beauty of their lives never be defined by their death.’
Author unknown
Suicide. The act of intentionally ending one’s life.
The ripple effect. Affects not only the victim, but affects all—leaves no one unscathed.
Suicide does not take away the pain, it gives it to someone else.
Does one ever truly get over a suicide loss?
Suicide is a leading cause of death, particularly in young people, both in Ireland and worldwide. An estimated 1 million people die by suicide worldwide each year. However, attempted suicides are much more common than actual suicides. Approximately 12,000 people attempt suicide each year in Ireland.
The whirlwind of events started during my journey to work.
I started my daily rituals, the key in the ignition, ready to go—ready to even make a small difference in one person’s life. I methodologically hummed a small prayer under my breath—hoping and praying to do no harm. I unapologetically cross my fingers and would cross my toes if I could, knowing deep within that superstitions follow us everywhere.
I continued to drive. I arrived at my practice, started my computer.
One of our receptionists rushed into the room, with a frantic expression.
‘Ahmeda, you need to have a look at this.’
She was talking, passing on patient details. The name sounded so familiar, but yet a distant memory.
I was trying to picture the patient and reignite my memory. I felt totally clueless. I had no idea whom she was talking about. She then continued to describe what had happened, and I remember just seeing her mouth move but not hearing what was being said.
‘Ok. Don’t worry. I will deal with this.’
I turned and shut the door. Close the door, the easiest way to shut the world out.
In my mind, I registered a ‘lesson’ for myself – never undermine the ways of body language; an artistic writing tool.
***
I prepared my doctor’s bag, unsure of what I should take to handle the situation. I called through to our practice nurse, hoping she would join me for moral support. She was pregnant, and I felt selfish asking her to join me, but she was more than happy to come and assist. I let out a big sigh of relief.
We arrived at the lake, the still water so calm. Rays of sunshine slowly touching the cool water. An eerie sense of peace, of calm. Yellow tape surrounding the tall trees. I ducked under the tape, tightly gripping my pristine dark brown doctor’s bag.
‘Seventy-eight year old male, found in the lake a few hours ago by her son-in-law.’
The daughter had noticed her mother was missing from her bed around 4 a.m., and they had all gone out to search for her. I assume that this was my patient’s last ever stroll.
Her last stroll out to the wilderness, where she did not want to be found.
The police had a body bag ready for me and slowly unzipped the plastic bag.
Yes, that was her.
That was my patient.
Margaret Reilly, petite woman whose brown hair, usually so neatly combed, was now ruffled. Her eyes wide open. On her left hand, her watch, clock hands stopped.
Time had stopped for her.
She was wearing her usual deep purple coat, thick enough to keep her warm but not thick enough to protect her from ending her own life. Underneath her purple coat, a beautifully made cardigan, which she had probably knitted herself. I remembered how she had come to see me about her ‘dry eyes’ and I was taken back how our conversations led to her passion about knitting jumpers. Can conversations change lives?
What was a warm sunny day now started to feel very cold.
***
Maybe if I spoke my findings aloud, it would confirm the reality of finding my patient.
A verbal assessment was made. On general inspection, pale and wet with no obvious signs of life.
No respiratory effort noted.
No response to verbal stimuli.
No response to painful stimuli. No carotid pulse palpable.
Pupils fixed and dilated bilaterally. No heartbeat or breathing sounds noted during three minutes of auscultation. There was a long pause.
Death confirmed at 10:15 a.m. We zipped up the bag.
And all that remained, were memories slipping through the frail hands of time.
That was it. My first death certification in the community.
***
When we were on-call in the hospital, we were usually certifying the deaths of patients we didn’t personally know. Patients with whom we hadn’t developed a bond. This was different though.
A suicidal death. A meaningful experience.
As a general practitioner, I was her doctor, and she was ‘my’ patient. I was to advocate for her physical and mental health. I was her advocate, and my goal was to look out for her best interests.
The core to being a general practitioner. But, look at how I had failed her.
Subsequently, I found myself questioning; why was I not able to identify her problem before it got worse? Why hadn’t I been able to recognise her hopelessness? Her demoralisation? Her desire for a hastened death? One good conversation can shift the direction of change forever.
I hopelessly looked around to catch a glance of her family, so I could offer my condolences.
They were nowhere to be found. I could not express my sorrow for their loss.
I could not convey my message and tell them that they were not alone in their grief.
I rushed back to the surgery in the knowledge that I had patients waiting, eagerly waiting for their problems to be solved. I saw the next patient, and then the next. No stopping me. The best way to deal with grief is to work hard, and even harder, and to keep going—or so I thought.
No time for housekeeping. We keep trying to put out the fires, trying to douse the fire with sprinkles of ‘holy’ water.
***
Last patient of morning surgery.
A tall young man entered with his mother. During this consultation, with each word, the sentences became heavier. He explained how his presence had no meaning, and that his absence will not make a difference. He voiced his suicidal ideation and how he had carefully prepared his manual for dying. He explained how he had saved up his euro cents to pay for his funeral so he would not be a burden for his family. His eyes were missing the shine; I was pondering that for him to feel like this, what had he lost this time?
Sitting in front of me, his mother began to wilt.
I was a mere bystander witnessing the deep abyss of his mother’s heart. Witnessing what true strength looked like. I paused for a moment and reflected on the fact of encountering a suicide that very same morning and now having the ability to potentially prevent another suicide. Do I dare to reach my hand out into the darkness, to pull another hand into the light?
Bad days gives us lessons and experience.
For the next few days, I kept thinking about this ‘life lesson’, and at times I had felt waves raging inside of me
and wondering how long do I wait for all this to fade? I was telling myself, to be patient, growth is tender, the ground is heavy, and this will take time.
May we as general practitioners become the voices of our patients who are disheartened, discouraged, depressed, and deceased?
Can we as general practitioners look for places to put our pain?
Do we reach a stage where our well-earned resilience is tested?
No one ever told me that grief can very much feel like fear.
At the risk of sounding cliché, I have learnt that we need to empower our patients to voice their thoughts; we need to listen to our patients and support them through whatever they may be going through. What an honour and immense privilege it is for us general practitioners to be trusted and welcomed into our patient’s circle.
Going forward, I vow that I will hold patients words ever so gently, so that when they hand over their heart to me through words I will understand that they have been through a lot.
The quieter I become, the more I will hear.
Having experienced this, I now have learnt that as a general practitioner, we also need to look after ourselves after events such as a suicide in the practice. Does that sound selfish and egotistical?
No, because if we take care of our emotional health and look after ourselves,
doing so will help us take better care of our patients. The evidence is crystal clear; the doctors who enjoy good mental health and are ‘engaged’ achieve better patient outcomes.

Why do you want to be a GP? The one question we don’t ask
by BJGP Life | May 18, 2018 | AiT, Opinion | 2
The first question to practise before a job interview; the one we all know will make an appearance…right?
Well, not if you’ve chosen to pursue a career in general practice. Whilst my colleagues were preparing evidence of their accomplishments and practising expected questions, I was revising for the entrance exam and practising OSCE based scenarios. So why is the entry to GP training so different, and what does that mean for the specialty?

My first year as a GP physician associate
Posted by BJGP Life | 26 Feb 2020 | Opinion | 0
Aimee Ehrenzeller is a physician associate working in general practice in South Wales. Her interests include women’s health, paediatrics and teaching.
When I first qualified as a physician associate (PA), I had no intention to work in general practice, at least until later in my career. I was unsure of the impact a PA could have in a GP setting prior to the much anticipated statutory regulation and associated prescribing rights. As a student, I was fortunate enough to undertake primary care placements where I met many GPs who were enthusiastic about the role of PAs. I took up a fixed-term 6 month post with one of these GPs upon qualifying and, over one year on, I have no intention of going elsewhere!
My typical day consists of on-the-day appointments, telephone consultations, routine appointments and clinical admin, including audit work and actioning blood results and hospital letters. On Wednesday afternoons, I run the baby clinic where I carry out six week medical checks and I have also completed extra training in coil fitting.
Prescribing
I had anticipated that the lack of prescribing rights for PAs while awaiting statutory regulation would be the biggest issue faced in primary care. After several months of building a trusting relationship with my GP supervisor, who is aware of my competencies and the areas in which I may need advice, prescribing issues rarely arise. My appointment slots are 15 minutes long, which allows for a standard consultation plus extra time to get a prescription signed and discuss the case if needed. My supervising GP will often be doing admin or telephone triage nearby, so patients are rarely kept waiting.
Patient views
Patients generally like the accessibility of my appointments, which are largely available on the day.
Patients are becoming more accepting of a multidisciplinary approach to healthcare. They are familiar with the roles of my colleagues including our practice specialist mental health practitioner, clinical pharmacists, extended role occupational therapy practitioner, nurse practitioners and first contact physiotherapy practitioners. I always begin my consultations by explaining who I am and what my role means, to ensure that patients do not falsely think they are being seen by a GP.
Patients generally like the accessibility of my appointments, which are largely available on the day, and recognise that my current non-prescribing status does not mean that they will leave without the appropriate treatment. My patients trust my clinical judgment and are always happy for me to consult with a GP if I need to.
Views of the team
Understandably, as with any new role, some colleagues have had reservations about working alongside a physician associate. One year in, I have been accepted by my team and my scope of practice is very well understood by the clinical and admin staff. As somebody who takes an active role in quality improvement and service redesign, my colleagues often come to me with questions about new protocols or guidelines. We have a flat team approach to working and recognise that our range of backgrounds and training is our strongest strength. Similarly, my colleagues are always more than happy to help me with areas that I am less confident with.
Impact on practice
Having a physician associate within the practice has meant greater accessibility to appointments, less pressure on the on-call doctor, improved prescribing rates in certain areas, a permanent member of staff who can act as a point of contact for locum GPs and teaching and shadowing opportunities for nurses and pharmacists undertaking advanced practice studies. With statutory regulation in the pipeline, the future is looking bright for PAs in primary care!

All The Little Lights: child sexual exploitation laid bare
Posted by BJGP Life | 27 Jun 2019 | Arts | 0
Original poster from 2017 production
We reviewed All the Little Lights in the March 2019 BJGP. A new production is on 12-17th August at the Tristan Bates Theatre as part of the Camden Fringe Season.
Lucy Mabbitt, one of the actors and co-producers in the three hander writes:
The story, told by award winning playwright Jane Upton, follows three young girls; two are survivors of child sexual exploitation and the other is vulnerable to exposure. One of the girls is also a perpetrator of abuse. The play is written from the girls’ perspective and provides an amazing insight into patterns of abusive behaviour, which we think is a clear and valuable way to help audiences empathise with those in that position.
By performing this piece we hope the audience will have a more nuanced and critical understanding of young people who have experienced child sexual exploitation (CSE), and be equipped to help spot signs and work to protect those at risk.The piece works to help us empathise with not only victims but young perpetrators like the central character Joanne, of which 28% are under 18 and are often misunderstood, disregarded in the national discourse about CSE and left without support or protection. Our production is largely about the importance of listening, and the perils of living in a society where we do not look out for each other.
We are working with care support professionals on a number of points for the project. This includes Safe and Sound, the Derby based charity who work to fight child sexual exploitation and who were involved in the original development of the play at the Nottingham Playhouse in 2015, as well as local charities and services in Camden who work with children, parents and carers affected by CSE.
This is in order to understand the context of the play and its characters and be careful to achieve authenticity, better our goal for using the play as a productive piece of awareness raising, safeguard our audiences, and promote the show among their channels in order to bring in new audiences for whom this story might be relevant. This way, the project is more than just putting on a play.

Is it time we reflect on the true value of reflection?
Posted by Edward Schwarz | 31 Aug 2016 | AiT, Opinion | 0
It is a Sunday evening. I look across at my GP ST1 wife and see her feverishly tapping the keyboard. I enquire what she is doing. “I have to do a couple of reflections, I’ve only done one this week.”
Reflection has become a major part of trainees and GPs’ lives alike. Most follow tried and tested models such as Gibbs1, to look back on an experience, challenge one’s own performance or thinking and see if this has led to learn new things or perhaps shape the way one behaves in the future. Sometimes, it may involve a patient whom has made a complaint, or an error you have made, or a system has failed and just like with the aviation industry that encourages transparency, can provide a platform with which to voice your thoughts and feelings.
As a guide, you are expected to do two reflections a week as a GP trainee. This helps form the basis of evidence to demonstrate competence in a certain curriculum area. So there lies another quandary – you may feel competent in an area but unless you have recounted an experience that demonstrates this adequately you will not pass. Recently, a reflection by a doctor was used by the prosecution in court against them.2. Since then, there have been numerous press releases by governing bodies, including Health Education England that have tried to reassure trainees that reflection is here to stay and as long as patient identifiable data is removed, will continue for the foreseeable future.
This case has now exposed prescriptive reflection for what it is – a cheap way of monitoring and ensuring training is completed. If one cannot be completely open and honest without the threat of it being used against you, then the result is not true reflective practice. If writers are not expressing their innermost thoughts and challenging themselves completely open and honestly, then they are providing just the right mix of intrigue to satisfy the college but without really engaging in the process. It becomes merely a tick box exercise – “I have been told I should reflect, I don’t want to be too honest and I have been given an arbitrary figure of two reflections per week so I better complete them.” This is just as bad as making a reflection up to fit into a curriculum box and both would contradict the GMC recommendation, “being open and honest”.
So is it time to move away from this model? Can reflection simply be spontaneous? My parents, both retired doctors, and their friends find it laughable that so much of our time is taken up by reflection. They were brilliant doctors and yet their personal learning wasn’t filled up with recounting their experiences on paper. Their reflection came in different formats. Sitting with a glass of wine and discussing your day either to a medical or a non medical friend or relative is valid reflection. It gives the opportunity to voice out loud one’s feelings and evaluate what you think you did well or could do better. The listeners can offer their own insights based on their experiences.
Some experiences may affect you so much, that they are good discussion points with which to base tutorials on with supervisors without the need for committing it to paper. If people find it useful to write down their experiences, they could keep a diary. There is a very real risk that training is shaping doctors to all conform to the same mould and dissuading really intelligent and reflective doctors into embarking on a career that requires them to complete these exercises.
No one has been able to tell me why reflection has such recent success and emphasis, or where its popularity came from. I want to be a brilliant GP who makes a real difference to my patients but I am worried my time will be focussed on completing these reflections in place of learning and keeping myself up to date. We have been advised to just embrace it – something my wife is struggling to do on her Sunday evening off. In a world of evidence based practice, where is the evidence that reflections are making us better doctors?
So what in place of prescriptive reflection I hear you ask? Well, I don’t have the answer to that question, but I need to finish my second reflection for the week so I’ll try and tackle it then – this is portfolio gold.

Living with breathlessness is hard
Posted by BJGP Life | 18 Jun 2019 | Research | 0
Dr Ann Hutchinson and Prof Miriam Johnson are researchers at the Wolfson Palliative Care Research Centre at the Hull York Medical School. They are on Twitter @AHutchinsonHull and @MJJohnson_HYMS
We know that living with breathlessness can be very difficult for both patients and their friends and family members.
Doing everyday things like cleaning and going shopping take a lot of effort. People may need help from others which can make them feel frustrated and down because they can’t do everything that they used to be able to.
“The emotional thing is extremely, extremely important. You don’t get the understanding… you can just like get caught up in a downward spiral and you end up in this little place all by yourself… ”
It can be hard for family members who can feel worried and isolated too.
“It ain’t just me; it’s my family as well, they have to go through it as well, people tend to forget them… they just think about the person whose got the illness, not the people they’ve got around them and it does affect them big time, they get emotional, they’re frightened.”
“We often feel lonely and on the edge of things.”
Breathlessness also makes people worried or frightened. At these times they need support from clinicians.
“I am all the time worried—worried when this breathing will attack me again.”
Bringing Breathlessness into View – a multimedia exhibition
We would like everyone to understand more about what it is like to live with breathlessness. We have worked together with people who experience daily breathlessness and local artists to make an exhibition called Bringing Breathlessness into View.
The exhibition has striking images and engaging sound recordings to help people understand what it is like to live with breathlessness. We hope visitors will find the exhibition thought provoking. Additionally, we are giving out information on how to live better with breathlessness so that people know there is something that can be done.
“I feel like Sleeping Beauty. The hedge has closed around me and I cannot do anything about it.”
These are three images from the exhibition to express both how difficult it is to live with breathlessness and also that it is possible to keep on going.
It is possible to keep going
Dr Dan Roper, GP and chair of NHS Hull CCG, who will be opening our exhibition in the British Lung Foundation’s Love Your Lungs week commented: “Breathlessness is a symptom of a wide range of medical conditions and it can be particularly challenging for people who live with it. It’s wonderful to see how art is helping to bring the voices of local people to light and share their stories in a way that both educates and inspires others. Breathlessness can be difficult, but there are ways to effectively manage the symptom and continue to lead a full life. It has been enlightening to support the recent research from the Hull York Medical School and we hope that their findings, along with the insights gleaned from this exhibit will help our clinicians offer the best care possible.”
There are things that can be done to help people live better with breathlessness
We want everyone to know that there are things that can be done to help people live better with breathlessness. There are many ways that patients can cope with breathlessness.
We have produced a booklet for patients and carers with practical things they can try to help them manage their breathlessness day to day, which can be downloaded from the Hull York Medical School website. This booklet incorporates information from the Cambridge Breathlessness Intervention Service. Further information is available from the British Lung Foundation website.
Many people find there are ways to cope with their breathlessness and have good lives. As one patient said:
“I’ve sort of changed my life. You can’t do the things you used to do, so you’ve got to say ‘‘well, okay, what can I do?’’ and do it.”
Clinicians can provide support and help people manage their breathlessness better. By focussing on breathlessness as a target for treatment in its own right, clinicians can support patients to adopt better self-management techniques so they can live well with breathlessness.
“She has got me organised and now I understand how the disease works. As a result, I have had a good summer. It makes me feel more resilient.”
To read more about our research and how clinicians can help people live well with breathlessness see our BJGP article.

When Sparks Fly: Choosing General Practice
Posted by BJGP Life | 18 Feb 2018 | Undergraduate | 1
Chloe Webster is a 4th year medical student, a yogaholic, creative writing enthusiast, and an aspiring future GP.
He was so different from the rest. Often, the only patients I remember clearly in my mind are unfortunately those who make me sad or angry. I am writing this as almost some sort of memoir to my future self so that I don’t forget such a lovely man. A simple 15-minute routine consultation changed more than just the outlook of my day, it changed me. I can still picture his tan brown boat shoes, woolly jumper and wire-rimmed glasses framing his welcoming face. From the moment I called his name, there was something about him. Within a matter of seconds, we had connected.
He had constant pins and needles, and all that he needed was to think of a damaged wire, sparking and sending signals when it shouldn’t.
He had come to see me at the surgery that morning. He shared his story with me and I was trusted to gain such a thorough understanding of his life. He told me everything. He had questions, and I was able to give him the answers he needed to understand his body. He had had neuropathic pain for over 20 years and no one, not even the specialists, had taken the time to explain what was going on. I couldn’t believe that he had been in the dark for such a long period of time. I explained the problem to him with my trusted analogy of rusty, damaged wires. His face lit up as soon as I started talking. He told me that he was an electrical engineer by trade. We laughed among ourselves at the coincidence, but I could see in his eyes that he finally understood what was happening. He had constant pins and needles, and all that he needed was to think of a damaged wire, sparking and sending signals when it shouldn’t. He was so truly thankful, and I was taken aback by his gratitude. A self-acknowledged infrequent attendee who finally had the answers he needed, and all it took was a few minutes of my day.
When he shook my hand before his departure, it felt as if I had known this man for my entire life.
When he shook my hand before his departure, it felt as if I had known this man for my entire life, rather than just the past 15 minutes, as if we had been dear old friends catching up. We both said our sincerest farewells until we meet again. He made such an impact, and I am a better person, maybe even a better doctor-to-be, for our paths crossing.
I sat alone in the consultation room. I paused, just for a moment to reflect upon the contentment spreading through me. I couldn’t hold back the smile spreading across my face. The thought of a career in general practice had briefly entered my mind before, but until now, it was never a decision with much certainty. Now I know – this is how I want to spend my life.
A career with the ability to truly know my patients on a one-to-one basis, a stranger enters the room but an acquaintance leaves, even in those pressured 10-minutes to be able to make a difference no matter how small.
This is why I am choosing general practice.

That was a beautiful piece. Well done for what you did for your patient, you gave him a threshold concept in your explanation of his symptoms that relates to his profession and life skills albeit coincidentally. Your analogy helped him to understand his disease and symptoms in a way that is deeper than any descriptive terminology could achieve, by simply comparing it to something very familiar to him. I have certainly learnt from your well written piece that occupational history can be used for something other than diagnosis and management of a disease. I have no doubt you will make an excellent GP, one that i could trust to be my doctor!

Audio essay: My loss
Posted by BJGP Life | 22 Jul 2019 | Clinical | 0
Ahmeda Ali is a GP in Ireland.
Ahmeda’s essay was one of the Sheppard Memorial Prize winners at the Republic of Ireland Faculty Winter Meeting. An abridged version will be published in the BJGP and here we present the full essay with a reading from the author, Ahmeda.
https://bjgplife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ahmeda_Audio-FINAL.mp3
‘May the radiance and beauty of their lives never be defined by their death.’
Author unknown
Suicide. The act of intentionally ending one’s life.
The ripple effect. Affects not only the victim, but affects all—leaves no one unscathed.
Suicide does not take away the pain, it gives it to someone else.
Does one ever truly get over a suicide loss?
Suicide is a leading cause of death, particularly in young people, both in Ireland and worldwide. An estimated 1 million people die by suicide worldwide each year. However, attempted suicides are much more common than actual suicides. Approximately 12,000 people attempt suicide each year in Ireland.
The whirlwind of events started during my journey to work.
I started my daily rituals, the key in the ignition, ready to go—ready to even make a small difference in one person’s life. I methodologically hummed a small prayer under my breath—hoping and praying to do no harm. I unapologetically cross my fingers and would cross my toes if I could, knowing deep within that superstitions follow us everywhere.
I continued to drive. I arrived at my practice, started my computer.
One of our receptionists rushed into the room, with a frantic expression.
‘Ahmeda, you need to have a look at this.’
She was talking, passing on patient details. The name sounded so familiar, but yet a distant memory.
I was trying to picture the patient and reignite my memory. I felt totally clueless. I had no idea whom she was talking about. She then continued to describe what had happened, and I remember just seeing her mouth move but not hearing what was being said.
‘Ok. Don’t worry. I will deal with this.’
I turned and shut the door. Close the door, the easiest way to shut the world out.
In my mind, I registered a ‘lesson’ for myself – never undermine the ways of body language; an artistic writing tool.
***
I prepared my doctor’s bag, unsure of what I should take to handle the situation. I called through to our practice nurse, hoping she would join me for moral support. She was pregnant, and I felt selfish asking her to join me, but she was more than happy to come and assist. I let out a big sigh of relief.
We arrived at the lake, the still water so calm. Rays of sunshine slowly touching the cool water. An eerie sense of peace, of calm. Yellow tape surrounding the tall trees. I ducked under the tape, tightly gripping my pristine dark brown doctor’s bag.
‘Seventy-eight year old male, found in the lake a few hours ago by her son-in-law.’
The daughter had noticed her mother was missing from her bed around 4 a.m., and they had all gone out to search for her. I assume that this was my patient’s last ever stroll.
Her last stroll out to the wilderness, where she did not want to be found.
The police had a body bag ready for me and slowly unzipped the plastic bag.
Yes, that was her.
That was my patient.
Margaret Reilly, petite woman whose brown hair, usually so neatly combed, was now ruffled. Her eyes wide open. On her left hand, her watch, clock hands stopped.
Time had stopped for her.
She was wearing her usual deep purple coat, thick enough to keep her warm but not thick enough to protect her from ending her own life. Underneath her purple coat, a beautifully made cardigan, which she had probably knitted herself. I remembered how she had come to see me about her ‘dry eyes’ and I was taken back how our conversations led to her passion about knitting jumpers. Can conversations change lives?
What was a warm sunny day now started to feel very cold.
***
Maybe if I spoke my findings aloud, it would confirm the reality of finding my patient.
A verbal assessment was made. On general inspection, pale and wet with no obvious signs of life.
No respiratory effort noted.
No response to verbal stimuli.
No response to painful stimuli. No carotid pulse palpable.
Pupils fixed and dilated bilaterally. No heartbeat or breathing sounds noted during three minutes of auscultation. There was a long pause.
Death confirmed at 10:15 a.m. We zipped up the bag.
And all that remained, were memories slipping through the frail hands of time.
That was it. My first death certification in the community.
***
When we were on-call in the hospital, we were usually certifying the deaths of patients we didn’t personally know. Patients with whom we hadn’t developed a bond. This was different though.
A suicidal death. A meaningful experience.
As a general practitioner, I was her doctor, and she was ‘my’ patient. I was to advocate for her physical and mental health. I was her advocate, and my goal was to look out for her best interests.
The core to being a general practitioner. But, look at how I had failed her.
Subsequently, I found myself questioning; why was I not able to identify her problem before it got worse? Why hadn’t I been able to recognise her hopelessness? Her demoralisation? Her desire for a hastened death? One good conversation can shift the direction of change forever.
I hopelessly looked around to catch a glance of her family, so I could offer my condolences.
They were nowhere to be found. I could not express my sorrow for their loss.
I could not convey my message and tell them that they were not alone in their grief.
I rushed back to the surgery in the knowledge that I had patients waiting, eagerly waiting for their problems to be solved. I saw the next patient, and then the next. No stopping me. The best way to deal with grief is to work hard, and even harder, and to keep going—or so I thought.
No time for housekeeping. We keep trying to put out the fires, trying to douse the fire with sprinkles of ‘holy’ water.
***
Last patient of morning surgery.
A tall young man entered with his mother. During this consultation, with each word, the sentences became heavier. He explained how his presence had no meaning, and that his absence will not make a difference. He voiced his suicidal ideation and how he had carefully prepared his manual for dying. He explained how he had saved up his euro cents to pay for his funeral so he would not be a burden for his family. His eyes were missing the shine; I was pondering that for him to feel like this, what had he lost this time?
Sitting in front of me, his mother began to wilt.
I was a mere bystander witnessing the deep abyss of his mother’s heart. Witnessing what true strength looked like. I paused for a moment and reflected on the fact of encountering a suicide that very same morning and now having the ability to potentially prevent another suicide. Do I dare to reach my hand out into the darkness, to pull another hand into the light?
Bad days gives us lessons and experience.
For the next few days, I kept thinking about this ‘life lesson’, and at times I had felt waves raging inside of me
and wondering how long do I wait for all this to fade? I was telling myself, to be patient, growth is tender, the ground is heavy, and this will take time.
May we as general practitioners become the voices of our patients who are disheartened, discouraged, depressed, and deceased?
Can we as general practitioners look for places to put our pain?
Do we reach a stage where our well-earned resilience is tested?
No one ever told me that grief can very much feel like fear.
At the risk of sounding cliché, I have learnt that we need to empower our patients to voice their thoughts; we need to listen to our patients and support them through whatever they may be going through. What an honour and immense privilege it is for us general practitioners to be trusted and welcomed into our patient’s circle.
Going forward, I vow that I will hold patients words ever so gently, so that when they hand over their heart to me through words I will understand that they have been through a lot.
The quieter I become, the more I will hear.
Having experienced this, I now have learnt that as a general practitioner, we also need to look after ourselves after events such as a suicide in the practice. Does that sound selfish and egotistical?
No, because if we take care of our emotional health and look after ourselves,
doing so will help us take better care of our patients. The evidence is crystal clear; the doctors who enjoy good mental health and are ‘engaged’ achieve better patient outcomes.

Hearing crackles: reflections on PACES and prejudice
Posted by BJGP Life | 15 Apr 2016 | AiT, Opinion | 1
Rachel Brettell is an Academic Clinical Fellow GP Trainee in the Oxford Deanery.
As a GP registrar, the MRCGP Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA) exam is currently at the forefront of my mind. VTS teaching focuses on how to pass, evenings are spent revising, and my bank account, now £1700 lighter, still makes me shudder. And yet, perhaps naively, it was still a shock to me to find out that at no point in the CSA exam am I expected to accurately detect real clinical signs. Of course, the CSA assesses many other important skills, including problem solving skills, person-centred care and attitudinal aspects. My argument is certainly not with the inclusion of these. However, given that ‘the validity of the CSA resides in its realistic simulation of real-life consultations,’ it seems strange that it includes no real patients, and consequently no real physical signs, both somewhat important components, I would argue, of many real-life consultations.
By contrast, the clinical component of Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP), the PACES exam (Practical Assessment of Clinical examination skills), involves real patients with a given condition. Candidates undertake a respiratory, abdominal, cardiovascular and neurological exam, as well as a history station, communication and ethics station, and two brief clinical consultations. In these, candidates are given eight minutes with a patient to take a focused history, carry out a relevant examination, respond to the patient’s concerns, and explain a management plan. This PACES exam is robust, and considered a rite of passage for medical trainees, who often require multiple attempts to pass. To a GP trainee it often seems unattainably tough. When colleagues pass, we congratulate them, but we also breathe a sigh of relief that we don’t have to go through the same arduous process, and in doing so, we perhaps elevate our colleagues above ourselves.
I would argue this is wrong on many levels.
This veneration of MRCP gives the impression that our exit exams are ‘easier’, or that we couldn’t pass a more robust exam should we need to. As a GP trainee who decided to undertake my MRCP exam, I would argue this is far from the truth. When I first started revising for the exam, I was met with a mix of attitudes. Confusion from many other trainees (why on earth would I put myself through such an arduous process when I didn’t have to), despair from my husband (yet another set of costly exams and weekends revising), and downright derision from my programme directors, who actively discouraged me from taking the exam as it would be a ‘distraction’ from ‘becoming a good GP’. But having been through the process, I can argue sincerely that I have little doubt I am a much better GP as a result. Revision involved seeing and examining vast numbers of patients and I now have much greater confidence in my ability to detect signs and synthesise clinical findings appropriately, quickly, and under pressure.
The two brief clinical encounters are pretty much as close to a real life GP consultation as you can get, and preparing for this was directly relevant to my day to day practice in GP. The sophisticated communication skills training I have received as a GP trainee was invaluable for the history and communication stations. The feedback I regularly receive from my GP trainers was far more meaningful and insightful than that given at expensive revision courses run by eminent hospital consultants, and is something I truly value as a result. Attending revision courses and practicing with colleagues really made me appreciate the art of consulting that we spend much time and effort honing, particularly as I watched others tying themselves up in nots over ethical dilemmas and breaking bad news scenarios that would be bread and butter to a GP trainee.
But more than just the relevance of the exam and the associated learning, gaining my MRCP has taught me so much more. It was a hard, but an eminently passable exam. Whilst it is tempting to put medical colleagues who have passed on a pedestal, this is dangerous, and risks exacerbating the disconnect between primary and secondary care. As GPs we are more than capable of passing this exam. I spend my days seeing undifferentiated patients, who present with a symptom (or 7!) rather than a diagnosis. Hence, ‘examine this patient with shortness of breath’ didn’t frighten me. I rarely have the results of bloods, imaging or other diagnostic tests on hand to confirm a diagnosis. Hence, detecting and interpreting a patient’s heart murmur without the luxury of an echo wasn’t anything new. Seeing a wide variety of patients in quick succession under considerable time pressure is ‘just another day in the office’ to me.
Furthermore, the revision process made me realise that some of our medical colleagues have an almost laughable lack of understanding of what we do, and what we face, day in day out in primary care. Whilst revising with a hospital colleague, I completed a particularly gruelling viva on pulmonary fibrosis. He was impressed with my answers (helped by a recent respiratory job), but, when he found out I was a GP trainee, exclaimed ‘What a waste! Why does a GP need to know anything about pulmonary fibrosis? You just hear the crackles and refer.’ My jaw dropped with disbelief, and had it not been so sincere, it might have been funny. He couldn’t understand the fundamental role of the GP in managing even the most complex medical patients. Needless to say I took some pleasure in pointing this out to him, but whilst silently sobbing inside.
Who suspects the initial diagnoses, and filters it out from all the others? Who supports the patient and their family through the diagnostic pathway, the treatment, and the inevitable decline? Who is there for anything and everything between their 3 monthly respiratory clinic appointments? Who keeps them out of hospital wherever possible, but negotiates an admission when needed? Who coordinates the vast array of healthcare professionals involved in their care? Of course, their GP. Yes, we value communication skills and holistic care, but we also provide very real medical care too. With foundation exposure to general practice remaining disappointingly low, we really do have a duty to address these disappointingly common misconceptions about what GPs do and the challenges we face.
Finally, and more controversially, I was met in some cases with a prejudice that I, as a GP trainee, wouldn’t be up to the rigorous exam process in a way that my medical colleagues were. The sad truth, that most aren’t willing to acknowledge, is that some secondary care colleagues still presume that people become GPs because they can’t get in to anything else. Several I spoke to were shocked that I had turned down a core medical job to undertake GP training. Most underestimated just how passionately we believe in the crucial role that GPs play, the enormous difference we can make to patient care, and the excellence we can strive to achieve as true generalists. It surprised many that I could be bothered to learn for an exam that wasn’t compulsory – a far cry from the reality of my cohort of GP trainees who have voluntarily undertaken (and paid for) many extra qualifications to further their knowledge and expertise. It gave me some pleasure when these types saw me perform well on a particular station, but that pleasure was far outweighed by the disappointment that this arrogance and lack of respect can still persist within our profession.
However, I believe it is just as much our job to get out there and change these attitudes and to prove our worth, as it is for our hospital colleagues to start recognising and respecting our skills. We still work in a hierarchical system of long held beliefs and prejudices. Until MRCGP is looked on with the same reverence as MRCP, we have work to do. I refuse to be looked down on by colleagues and our exit exam, which seemingly places little emphasis on detecting clinical signs, may actually play into many prejudices about the profession, as a touchy feeling world where failed medics go to see out their days trying to persuade patients with viral URTIs they really don’t need antibiotics and managing mild depression.
So I would argue, perhaps only a little tongue in cheek, we all should be taking PACES. I think back to my revision course colleague and his belief that, as GPs, we ‘hear crackles and refer.’ Passing this exam means yes, I hear the crackles and have confidence in my ability to do so. But, perhaps most importantly of all, just one or two more of my hospital colleagues might also now recognise and value us GPs as the robust, efficient and highly skilled clinical workforce we are, who do so much more than ‘just hear crackles and refer…’

You have made some pertinent observations and I congratulate you on achieving MRCP(UK). I too work as a GP and hold MRCP(UK) and , having worked in GP land for over 10 years, I am of the opinion that it is the process of acquiring MRCP which engenders enduring good habits which, sadly, are not instilled to anywhere close to the same degree by MRCGP. Moreover, to pass MRCP(UK) one needs to have done an array of medical disciplines whereas I have encountered GPs with MRCGP whose general medical experience consists of their house job (?FY1) and a 6 month stint which comprised of 3 months Care of the Elderly and 3 months Rehab only.On a weekly basis I see patients whose results have been ignored or misinterpreted (such as labelling a patient as being in AF because the computer interpretation of a trace says so when clearly P waves are present); correspondence which ignores medication changes or other points of action; physical signs which are evaluated shoddily (eg patients labelled as having aortic stenosis because of a systolic sound at the aortic area-with no consideration to pulse character/apex beat/second heart sound/BP); inappropriate referrals because signs are misinterpreted; poor investigative pathways (eg the buck stops when an anaemic patient has normal haematinics)- the list goes on.
An analogy, if you will:a layman when inspecting a painting may comment on the colours whereas the devoted art critic will infer emotional content. When presented with a patient, the holder of MRCP will see, and extract, much more cogent information than that obtained by a superficial analysis of the information. I accept the GPs role is not to be the same as the hospital physician, but it is dis-spiriting to see such superficial medicine being practised daily; when pointed out to the purveyors of such practise they do actually (when pushed) have much of the knowledge but they lack the afore-mentioned approach which the MRCP so beautifully bestows.

BJGP Long Read: A valedictory note on my retirement
Posted by BJGP Life | 21 Feb 2020 | BJGP Long Read | 18
Claire Stillman is a recently retired GP who spent 30 years in Scottish general practice, the last 20 of which were in Glasgow.
About eight months ago I wrote an emotional, angry rant about why I was leaving general practice. It was in response to a questionnaire from the LMC asking me for reasons why I was going. I never sent it to them; it seemed enough to write everything down and it exhausted my anger. I kept meaning to go back to it but I never did, probably because it was too upsetting when I was in work and then it became irrelevant when I left. My emotion had been expended. Also, I felt that I had said nothing new. There were no blinding insights, other people had said the same things over and over and nothing had changed. It is hard to see how anything can change given the current structure and funding of the NHS. I should say that I took early retirement at the age of 59 following 30 years in General Practice and I might have taken a handful of days of sick leave in that time. I never took any time off for stress.
Here are the reasons I left, or perhaps some of them:
Appointments
The appointment system is not fit for purpose. A GP has to be all things to all people in 10 minutes only and this is untenable. In this time we have to deal with the polypharmacised multiply morbid patient who has several problems to discuss. We have to manage an increasing amount of clinical work transferred from secondary to primary care. We have to deal with the manipulative, the dangerous and the deluded. We have to deal with those with shopping lists of demands, the worried well, those sent by third parties for proof of just about anything. We have to deal with the longwinded, the demented, the unhappy, the angry. We have to deal with the worried parent and the sick child. We have to deal with the medical emergency or those who think it is an emergency. The list goes on. We are accessible to everyone, every single being has the right to walk in to discuss anything; there is no filter, no prior discussion to see whether a trip to a GP is appropriate or suitable.
We pay an emotional price for constant availability for everything the world throws at us.
GPs can be bullied and manipulated by a public who increasingly demand certainty and rights and a bureaucracy that seeks to medicalise social problems. In all this we have no support. We were trained to help others’ suffering, not manage our own. We pay an emotional price for constant availability for everything the world throws at us (and I mean everything), and a professionalism that is never acknowledged or meaningfully supported. We face the relentless expectations of the ten minute appointment, the constantly full waiting rooms, the unacceptable waiting times to be seen and feel constantly punished because we cannot meet them. I can honestly say that in all my time as a GP principle, I can count on one hand the times I did not have a fully booked surgery. Government policy, patient expectation, pressure on our staff mean that we are constantly in the wrong, on the back foot, for not delivering a service that, quite frankly, is impossible to provide. We are supposed to be made of teflon, have no feelings, cope with the relentless daily, monthly, yearly pressure of not delivering the impossibly perfect service that this society believes is their right.
Patient expectations
Expectations by patients have changed over my thirty years in practice. Society has changed; the consumer approach, the belief that everything should have an answer, the inability to accept the uncertainty of life and health; the belief that if something goes wrong someone must be to blame have all increased over time. Expectations increasingly fuelled by the unrealistic claims made on the internet. Also the idea that everyone should have instant access, instant answers, has grown. These expectations are not really compatible with what GPs do, namely manage uncertainty. Because of this GPs have been harried into increasing amounts of patient tests, often with no clear goal in mind and no evidence that it would be useful. On the contrary, tests breed insecurity and more tests, because doctors feel the need to cover themselves, to insure themselves against patients demanding ever more certainty. It is ironic that in an age when the population has never been more healthy or long lived, health uncertainty and anxiety increases. Adding to patient expectations is the medicalisation of human sadness. The belief that a doctor can make grief, sadness, the ordinary difficulties of life better with a pill or therapy seems to have increased steadily over the years.
Lack of resources
Mental health services were reason enough to leave general practice.
GPs are damned if they do and damned if they don’t. We are placed in impossible double binds by chronic NHS underfunding and then blamed for the outcomes. Classic examples are the exploitation of our gate keeping roles by saying we must refer less into secondary care and then blaming us for not diagnosing enough cancers. We are held responsible for not diagnosing the rarest of cancers, which have no characteristic sets of symptoms, and yet demonised or refused by secondary care if we refer patients like these in.
Mental health services were reason enough to leave general practice. The NHS in my area refused to fund or possibly organise an even half functioning service and given society’s propensity for medicalising any adverse human experience we were imprisoned in the ultimate double bind and for us it was a life sentence. Throughout my entire career I was supposed to deal with the mentally distressed in ten minute appointments with no credible back up. The media slammed us for handing out too many antidepressants giving the impression that we had any alternatives. Trust me, we did not. The stark choices for GPs dealing with mental distress ranging from overt psychosis to a little sadness were a prescription for a pill then and there and a bit more than ten minutes (thereby pressurising everyone else in the waiting room), or a referral for a mental health treatment, be it talking therapy or more assessment which might occur within the next 3 to 6 months. The icing on the cake was that despite a GP referral, the mental health service might decide, several weeks later, not to offer any treatment at all. Truly GPs backs are up against the wall when dealing with mental health problems, which on a conservative estimate, take up to 20% of their work. Indeed, there is a psychological component to all disease. Dealing with mental health services throughout my career was the most excruciating and depressing aspect of my job.
Another problem caused by underfunding, which inexorably worsened throughout my time in practice, was waiting times. This has caused the NHS to become cruel in its dealing with suffering patients. I have seen people with severe, debilitating, painful conditions having to wait up to a year to be seen in secondary care. And then they get sent for tests, have to wait months for their results, and then they have to wait further months for follow up in clinics to get the results of said tests. Hospital doctors never make decisions without panels of tests that seem to grow larger by the year. Meanwhile the GP is the only doctor a patient can directly access while waiting for all these events, the walls are very high around secondary care, and we are expected to manage their pain, anxiety and frustration with no power to change anything. As usual, there is no support for the GP managing the patient in this vacuum and the more compassionate the GP, the more likely they are to be broken by this powerlessness in the face of suffering.
Complexity
Patients are becoming increasingly complex. They live longer, are on more medication and often have two, three or even more co-existing conditions. We are expected to deal with their needs in ten minutes, or consider their problems in the little time we have between fire-fighting paperwork and results and managing the practice. Meanwhile secondary care is becoming more specialised with increasing numbers of silos. A patient goes to a hospital clinic where a specialist has the luxury of dealing with one condition only, with all the back up of a hospital department. And it can happen that the decision a specialist makes about the one condition that is their remit will have a knock on effect for the other conditions a patient might have. It is left to the GP to sort it out. A record achieved by one of my patients was that he visited seven different specialties on a regular basis, all of which dealt with one aspect of his care and none of which could come up with an overarching explanation for his symptoms. Needless to say I had ten minutes to deal with all of them. The use of protocols, guidelines and non-doctor vetting of secondary care referrals also lead to GP stress, not to say cruelty to the patient. The silos are getting narrower, secondary care clinicians are more and more empowered to say what they will not deal with . Meanwhile GPs have to deal with their rejections with no support for their suffering patients.
Polypharmacy
This is a real problem in the ten minute appointment. All evidence based medicine derives from studies on single conditions and all medication guidelines come from them. The problem is that very few patients have only one condition. The GP has to juggle co-prescribed medications with their multiplicity of interactions and side effects in each individual, very difficult in a busy surgery with a waiting room full of patients expecting to be seen on time. Ironically when the community pharmacists started to be involved in the Scottish NHS new contract, they stated they would need thirty minutes per patient. And a pharmacist would only be dealing with medications while the GP has to deal with the actual patient’s agenda, which may be something else entirely. Prescribing outwith the consultation has also become more onerous over the last few years as drug shortages and the increasing prescribing demands of secondary care have to be managed.
Poorly understood conditions/somatisation/chronic pain
Some of the hardest patients to deal with, the most time consuming and emotionally draining, are the ones that don’t fit into neat diagnostic boxes, yet constantly present with suffering and demand answers. These patients are not recognised by, and certainly not treated by secondary care. For example, those people with chronic pain for which we actually have no effective medication. Synthetic opiates, the only treatment out there, do not work and turn them into addicts. Any attempts at psychological reframing of their conditions are seriously resisted by the patients, and to be frank, the medical establishment.
There seems to be a belief that GP is elastic can continuously absorb extra work indefinitely.
The Cartesian dualism that bedevils our concepts of illness means that patients and many doctors think that the ultimate insult is to suggest that their suffering is ‘all in their head’ and for some strange reason does not then exist. Unfortunately GPs are faced with a number of patients who manifest their life distress with physical symptoms, call it somatisation for want of a better term, for whom existing medicine has no treatment and who become bitterly entrenched in their illness behaviour as they feel less and less cared for. The ‘fibromyalgics’, the chronically fatigued, for whom there is no realistic therapy and for which GPs have no training or support. I am not surprised that so many of them turn to snake oil salesman and quacks who at least provide them with attention before exploiting their vulnerabilities.
Outsourcing of secondary care work
Over the years, general practice has been subjected to a form of ‘mission creep’ with secondary care demanding that we increasingly do work that was originally done in hospital medicine. While it may seem reasonable that GPs manage new atrial fibrillation or perform near patient testing, this is added to our already increasing workload. There seems to be a belief that GP is elastic can continuously absorb extra work indefinitely. There is only so much work that we can take before we break.
Housebound patients
While home visit rates have gone down, housebound patients are becoming increasingly complex so that visits can resemble ward rounds in a geriatric hospital. Patients are often on medications and have conditions that need frequent monitoring and repeat visits that we are not resourced to manage. Latterly, I became increasingly concerned about our cohort of usually elderly, frail housebound patients on complex, potentially dangerous treatment regimes who were poorly managed in the community. General practice as it stands is just not equipped to deal with these people.
Conclusion
I think the chief thing to emphasise is that GPs stand alone, and are chronically under resourced. We may work in group practices and have our administration staff, but once the door is closed, it is just the GP and the patient in the room together. And in real time we have no support, indeed we have no formal support networks at all on the ground. There is no-one to catch us as we fall, we have no protection from the ire of the public, anger that is usually caused by a system that fails to deliver what has been promised. We stand and fall by the decisions we make in ten minutes and if things go wrong, the full weight of public and professional opprobrium lands on our heads. There is no safety net, no cavalry coming over the hill to relieve us.
Now, I have retired and I do not miss any of it. I was well thought of by my patients and staff to judge by the feedback I have received over the years and the overwhelming number of cards and presents I received when I retired. I also got on with and liked my partners. Yet a powerful emotion I associate with my time in general practice was one of failure. I had failed to deliver a good service and so now I am just relieved to be free of it. However, what does bother me is that I had a wealth of knowledge and skills, accumulated over lifetime, which I will never use again.
Yet there is no place for me now in my profession, general practice has lost my skills and those of all my retired peers completely.
And what does strike me is that perhaps my profession could benefit from my and my peers’ experience. I could perhaps mentor younger GPs, newly practising partners, and provide them with the support I never had. I can read a face, interpret its subtle movements, be aware of another’s suffering. I can listen actively and frame peoples’ stories empathetically and positively. I can pull out the essential points in a narrative, summarise a conversation, help someone form a plan for the future. I can listen. Yet there is no place for me now in my profession, general practice has lost my skills and those of all my retired peers completely. I feel that this is a shame as we are a resource that could be utilised for the good of the profession.
As for the future of general practice, I do not trust the Scottish NHS and the health boards to deliver the supposed new Scottish GP contract. They mouth platitudes but follow their own agendas rather than those of general practice, they have not trusted GPs to execute the changes and allocated funds seem to have dissipated in a plethora of talking shops and committees. It seems that the further you remove practitioners, the people who actually do the work, from decisions about how the work is done, the less successful the outcome. Unfortunately, GPs have been so busy actually doing their jobs, they have not had the time or emotional energy to fight for a new contract that works for them. I have little hope that the new contract will result in better experiences for patients or their doctors.
However, it can be argued that innovation, out of the box thinking comes from those without an interest in the system, so let’s throw the problem of how to run an NHS out there. Let all and sundry chew on it, because I don’t expect those within the system to come up with any answers. Lets hope someone has thought of something before the inevitable happens to me and I become a patient.

All my thoughts after 20+ years in general practice, but written beautifully.
Thank you

Hi, I hope you weren’t too depressed by the article. How to change things for the better is the question. Good luck if you’re still working away! Clare

Thank you so very much for putting my sentiments down in such an eloquent way. I left my partnership in Glasgow recently aged 55 for the reasons you have outilined. I waited for the new contract and knew it was inadequate and resigned my partnership.
“the more compassionate the GP, the more likely they are to be broken by this powerlessness in the face of suffering”- this especially very much summed up my experience.
I now locum and feel more protected and distanced from the toxic work conditions expected of me by myself, patients, the NHS and the SG. I feel my experience of 30years as a doctor is wasted and I just have to suck it up and not dwell on it. That’s life! A shame when there is so much capacity of compassion and skill to give to people, given the right conditions.

Hi, given the current situation, perhaps we should view Active GP as something that you do for a finite time only, as part of a “portfolio career “ not a whole working lifetime. Rather you spend sometime at the frontline, then move onto less stressful jobs having done your bit. The question would be what to move on to that we have the skills and training for, apart from locum work. Also I think most people would agree that the more experienced the doctor the better practitioner they are. Always remembering that experience can just mean making the same mistakes with increasing confidence!

I also took early retirement from GP Partnership at 56 and have not regretted it. As I walked out of my surgery for the last time I almost literally felt a weight lifted from my shoulders. I share the author’s regret that I can’t continue to use the wisdom and experience gained over 30 years to help patients and relieve some of the burden from my younger colleagues.

Wow. Thank you for a brilliant, honest piece. I’m relatively early in my GP career and I recognise ALL of what you say. At the moment, the good outweighs the bad for me in GP, but I do wonder if I have the resilience to stay the distance. The lesson for me is: look after yourself and each other, because everyone else will milk you as dry as you let them.
I have saved this article for future reference and sharing. Thank you again.

I also took early retirement at 59 now nearly 7 years ago. This article describes my feelings too (OK in England not Scotland). I feel too that stopping work lifted a burden from me and regret at never being able to do the job to the best of my ability due to constant time pressure. The skills I gained in listening to my patients for over 30 years are no longer available to the NHS, as new less experienced doctors are assumed to be of equal value to the NHS. Bums on seats can be counted and that’s what appears to matter to those counting and making the rules.

Thanks for all your comments. Perhaps the RCGP should consider the mentoring idea! I refer to the comment I made above about limited stints at the front line. Sadly, in Scotland there is a shortage of new GPS and practices have had to shut up shop because of this. Clare

Clair, your comments eloquently outline the challenges and unreasonable demands placed on GP’s and 5 years ago I faced the same dilemma in my English practice of 30 years, and at 58 I too decided it was time to leave. I then decided to tackle a different challenge and moved to a much smaller remote and rural practice in the Hebrides as an NHS salaried partner. Surgeries and lists became smaller and I now have the luxury of time to spend with the patients and have the support of fabulous community staff. The experience and knowledge I’ve accumulated has been well used and I’ve truly enjoyed this final phase of my medical career, and I’m still working here
5 years later!
We are privileged to have the job we do, but time pressures can certainly prevent us giving our patients the service they deserve.

What a brilliantly written article. Comprehensively details why GP is failing and will likely not exist, at least in its current format, in the next 10-15 years. GP is the Walmart of medicine, pile them in, stack them high – all you can fit, anything and everything in a 10min appt. It is popular with politicians as they need cheap medicine by GPs to subsidise the expensive specialists and keep the tax payers happy with lower tax rates.
Unfortunately the real world is not like the Dr Who Tardis and time does not expand. GPs are human and to remain humane, we need to self care to avoid burnout. For some it will be time to boundary patients, for others it will be time to cut back on sessions and and for many it is time to look for alternative careers. I used to look at GPs as a child in the 1980s with deep respect and awe, they had status and commanded respect from their peers. These times no longer exist. Now each day is a battle for many if not most. I left the NHS year ago and will not return, I wish those of you who remain the best.

This has been one of the best short reads describing what GP life has become and I can’t disagree with any of it. Strange thing is, like the Gp reply above, who moved to a small rural practice , and enjoying his last 5 years, I too have honestly rarely ever had a bad day in my 30 years as a GP partner now aged 58 Wales. Small personalised list 2750 (weighted list 3500) in a 2 person (1.5fte) so 4 day week. The single biggest reason I remain happy and peaceful in the midst of the plethora of issues you so eloquently describe is for me they all become so much milder/manageable/solvable when there is someone who armed with a life time knowledge of their small 1300-1500 patients characters, expectations and illnesses, finds decisions and tests ,mail and the whole lot becomes quicker easier, more thorough.Its not that I am not busy ,it’s just not always busy. It’s not that I am better as I am not.
From what I see and hear in the profession generally, I can’t see a sustainable way forward for Primary care unless we rapidly move to personalised lists, yes in group partnerships supported by HCSW/Nurses/PA/admin . I mean where you are solely responsible for your own patients, not someone else’s,not strangers,not patients who try and manipulate new GPs. Yes seek 2nd opinions occasionally, Expect yes a day off each week where similar partner /colleagues cover any emergencies.No long waits to be seen . Telephone first less necessary, “Rubbish“ I hear some think,but I maintain it is all very possible because my experience is the time saving and in depth supervision by one GP of an almost totally “known” population really does yield the time and space to let us cope,grow and even thrive.
Most complex illnesses become less stressful as you have been with them through it all and know them almost as well as they do. Your previous consultation laid out the actions you would do if they returned. Ten minutes often plenty bar the first new complex illness, no more long history taking by talented GPs who have little knowledge of the patient multiplied a thousand times a year .Less mental stress and clinician anxiety.
Add in HCSW, social Prescribing and decent mental health services and it become a real pleasure and something even at 58 I don’t wish to give up.
Planning 2 days a week till 65.
You asked for a solution. There it is. Not meant to be Patronising. Personalised lists where you and only you ,95% of the time have to make the decisions that will affect your workplace tomorrow and next week Is the way ahead. .Claire, please don’t stay away, seek a small practice as you are incredibly valuable. As for me I am planning 2 days a week till 65.

I am a 50 year old GP working in North West England. I could not agree more with everything that is written in this article. I am a very robust individual and continue to work as a Partner in a large practice with great colleagues. However I have seen many very good people “broken” (alcoholism, Depression, burn out) by the toxic environment of General Practice.Good UK GPs are some of the finest and hard working General Physicians in the world. In the last 10 years I have come to the conclusion that the NHS is not fit for purpose in the current world and never will be. The sooner the NHS becomes a private insurance based service then the sooner GPs will be able to control their workload / quality of care and lead a full rewarding working life that does not “break them”.

Clair, what a beautifully written article.
Thank you.
Last year I initiated the project “Rediscover the Joy of General Practice” https://www.srmc.scot.nhs.uk/joy-project/
It is specifically designed for GPs like you coming up for retirement but who feel they have more to give, but not under the pressures you describe.
It began as a collaboration between NHS Orkney, Shetland, Western Isles and Highland and this year has expanded to include other Scottish Health Boards.
It is based on work undertaken in Orkney over the last 10 years.
We offer contracts of between 6-18+ weeks/year to undertake practice attachments for periods of 1-4 weeks at a time. Travel from a Scottish city and accommodation is paid for, meaning that GPs do not need to relocate.
Our philosophy is based on supporting the practices and staff in all aspects of GP work and quality improvement.
Have a look at the website to understand the scheme more fully.
In 2019 we recruited 33 GPs to our Rural GP Support Team, many were retiring GPs who have felt reinvigorated by working with us.
This year we have expanded the scheme to involve the whole of Scotland and not just rural practices.
Currently we have shortlisted a further 35 GPs.
Although we have officially closed, we will still accept late applications and will reopen to applications again once we have established this second team.
What is interesting is that as our team expands and develops we suddenly find that we have the opportunity to consider how we can tackle what previously seemed intractable problems.
All members of the team are encouraged to contribute their ideas of how we could tackle thorny issues and due to the phenomenal depth of experience and expertise among our GPs we find ourselves in an unusually empowered position.
The project is led by the Primary Care Associate Medical Directors and Managers from the participating Health Boards and has the full backing of the Scottish Government.
We are at an early stage and certainly do not have all the answers, but we are determined to try and make a difference.
Working together with vision, determination and lateral thinking I believe we can make real changes – however, I am a self-confessed irresponsible optimist!
Anyone interested, do have a look at the website and please feel free to join us.
Claire, I would very much like to have a chat with you and to explore some of your ideas.
My email is charles.siderfin@nhs.net

Churchill Fellowships: an opportunity to make a difference
Posted by BJGP Life | 22 Mar 2019 | Scholarship | 0
David Jeffrey is a palliative care doctor and member of the Advisory Council of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust.
Churchill Fellowships are awarded by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust (WCMT) to enable UK citizens to explore innovative ideas abroad and return with new insights which address key issues facing our society. A wide range of categories are open to applicants at all levels and include healthcare and innovation in the 21st century, palliative care, suicide prevention, migration, rural communities and access to healthcare.
General practitioners are closely involved with many of these issues, yet few apply for Churchill Fellowships. This paradox may, in part, be due to a lack of awareness of the availability and scope of Churchill Fellowships. General practitioners in the UK also face a number of challenges: accessibility, continuity, stress and low morale.1Baird B, Charles A, Honeyman M, Maguire D, Das P. Understanding pressures in general practice. The King’s Fund. London 2016. These challenges are exacerbated by factors such as: falling numbers, early retirement, recruitment and the widespread involvement of locums. The challenges facing GPs are another key issue for our society.
WCMT are keen to encourage GPs to apply for Churchill Fellowships and are willing to be flexible about project plans.
Churchill Fellowships offer hard-pressed GPs an opportunity to take a short but valuable amount of time away from their work, to address some of these challenges. Fellows are funded to spend 4-8 weeks anywhere in the world, pursuing research of their own devising. By travelling abroad to meet colleagues in primary care, they may gain insights which they can share when they return home. The Winston Churchill Memorial Trust has both a network of Fellows and partnerships with other organisations that can help to disseminate innovative ideas for good practice.
The Winston Churchill Memorial Trust (WCMT) was established in 1965, as a national memorial to Sir Winston Churchill. Since then WCMT has sent out over 5,500 Fellows worldwide. Applications for the next round of Fellowships opens in May 2019 and closes in September 2019. Details of WCMT and the application process are available on the website.
Applicants must be UK citizens over the age of 18. The application process is straightforward, beginning with an initial outline project plan. In contrast to academic research bids, the application form is simple. If the application is judged by the WCMT panel to be of potential benefit to a community in the UK, as well as to the applicant, and is a practical plan which can be carried out in the time, the applicant may be shortlisted. Shortlisted applicants are invited to submit a more detailed plan which also describes how they will disseminate the lessons learned from their Fellowship. The short-listed applicants are interviewed by the panel in the WCMT offices in London. Successful applications need to demonstrate the potential of their Fellowship to make a difference and promote change.
The Churchill Fellowships are usually 4-8 weeks in duration, and this can be split into separate periods to allow for workplace responsibilities. The awards which cover living costs, travel and accommodation, vary between £4,000 and £10,000. There is no availability for payment of locum cover. Perhaps the most significant benefit of a Fellowship is that it opens doors to meeting leaders in the Fellow’s field of interest. WCMT staff offer support and advice throughout the whole process. The Trust encourage Fellows to leave spaces in their itinerary to follow up serendipitous contacts which always occur during their visit.
Following the completion of the Fellowship, the Fellow is expected to submit a report to WCMT which describes their findings and dissemination plans. The report is primarily for the Fellow to focus their reflections and recommendations for implementing change, as a public manifesto for their ideas. At this stage, WCMT knowledge partners can be of assistance in ensuring that the conclusions reach those in a position to implement change.
WCMT are keen to encourage GPs to apply for Churchill Fellowships and are willing to be flexible about project plans which acknowledge the difficulties in taking prolonged leave from practice. The benefit from a Fellowship is not limited to an individual but extends to his/her workplace, community and sometimes nationally. Browsing the WCMT website reveals a range of projects covered in Fellowships, including child bereavement, assisted suicide, prison medicine, child abuse, mental health and well-being.
My Churchill Fellowship, in 2006, explored how healthcare professionals viewed assisted dying in the North West United States. The six-week Fellowship was based in Seattle and Portland. The Churchill Fellowship opened doors to leaders in the field of end of life care and to those involved in researching and implementing the Death with Dignity Act in Oregon. I was invited into multidisciplinary meetings, met doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists and ethicists at work and in their homes. As a result of the Fellowship, my objections to the legalisation of assisted suicide were informed by the views and experiences of these colleagues in the United States. Back in the UK, I became involved in the national debate around assisted suicide and published a book expressing palliative care perspectives on this issue.2Jeffrey D. Against Physician Assisted Suicide: a palliative care perspective. Radcliffe Publishing, Oxford (2009)
A Churchill Fellowship can be a life-changing experience, offering a break to address an important issue and to return refreshed with new insights which can lead to improvements in primary care. I hope colleagues in primary care will explore the WCMT website and feel encouraged to apply for a Churchill Fellowship.

A video to help patients get the most out of 10 minutes
Posted by BJGP Life | 4 Nov 2019 | Bright Ideas and Innovation | 0
Ed Schwarz has just completed his GP training as an educational scholar in Cornwall and is now a GP in Penzance.
Fed up of running late? Another patient cancelled last minute? Need to examine someone wearing 12 layers?
If we are honest, there are some things that patients do that can add extra time to your consultation. Did you know many patients are not aware their consultation is just 10 minutes? Although there are discussions in place about extending the 10 minute consultation, currently demand means for many practices this is not achievable.
This free video is available for all practices to use on their websites or in their waiting rooms and aims to educate patients about the 10 minute consultation and how to get the most of it. They work well without sound.
It was created as part of a QI project during my Educational Scholar role as an ST3 with finding via HEE.

RCGP Conference 2015: Stephen Bergman on good patient care
Posted by BJGP Life | 2 Oct 2015 | Arts, Opinion | 0
Stephen Bergman is a doctor, novelist and playwright. He is currently a Clinical Professor of Medicine in Medical Humanities and Ethics at New York University Medical School. His book, The House of God, published in 1978, is firmly established in medical culture and deservedly has wider ‘cult classic’ status.
In 1971, I wrote this piece, and recently have looked back at it. In a sense it has all the things I’ve learned since, and that every good General Practitioner learns. I give a little current comment on what in fact I have learned, at the end.
THE PATIENT IS THE WORLD
Samuel Shem
Medical students in their course on diagnosis are taught: “When you hear hoof beats outside the window don’t assume it’s a zebra.” This means that you should think of common diseases first, not exotic ones. Decades ago when I was a medical student in Boston at one of man’s greatest hospitals, I was assigned a woman with “difficulty breathing.” She was 56 years old, a mother of three whose husband had died two years before. In good health all her life, she worked in a flower shop. She had never before had trouble breathing. Her husband’s death had been a shock, but with the support of friends and family she had gotten through it pretty well. The resident—my boss—came in and took his history, in a rat-a-tat technique of asking a probing question which had to be answered yes or no, and as soon as there was a response, cutting her off and moving on to the next—I knew he was filling in his grid, a decision tree that would provide the diagnosis. No new information came up. Physical exam showed nothing but her panting. Lab work revealed increased eosinophilia, the blood cell that increases when the body is allergic to something. The resident went back and grilled her on allergies. Nothing.
Her workup proceeded in classic academic fashion, with increasingly refined blood tests and X-rays. The latter showed a diffuse pattern of lung irritation, but no lesions or tumors. Experts were called in, and each diagnosed something in their area of expertise, from the psychiatrist diagnosing “melancholia” at her husband’s death, to the surgeons wanting to cut. She kept getting worse, the oxygen levels in her blood falling lower and lower, blueing her lips, paling her face. A look of doom seemed to cloud her eyes. The surgeons did a lung biopsy which showed only that her lung was reacting to some antigen, as the blood test had shown.
She continued to decline. Palliative treatment was begun. The resident and staff doctors seemed reluctant to enter her room. I felt scared for her and sorry, and spent more and more time sitting with her, just talking—a medical student has time for this arcane procedure. One day I asked where she lived. She said that after her husband died she’d taken in boarders to survive. I asked about them. “One of them’s…a real trip,” she gasped. “A magician.” I smiled and asked more about him. Part of his act involved trained pigeons, which he kept in cages in the basement. “The cages are right above my washer drier.” My ears perked up. It turned out that whenever she ran the drier, the pigeon droppings were aerosolized and she breathed them in—for the past two years. I rushed to the medical library—in those days we still used books—and found “Pigeon Breeder’s Lung Disease.” Treatment: get rid of the pigeons; and a course of steroids. Prognosis: excellent. The magician suffered. She got well.
Looking back now, what did I learn?
That the science of medicine is astonishing and useful, but it can keep us from practicing the human art of listening and responding, face to face, heart to heart, without a decision tree in mind or a computer on our laps so we stare into the screen instead of look into the eyes, all to “save time”. That the for-profit insurance industry dictates that we doctors don’t have time to listen to our patients if we want to get paid. That if we rely on technology and tests and neglect “being with” the patient, we may well miss the vital human facts that will solve the mystery and bring the cure. And that the patient is never only the patient, the patient is the spouse (alive or dead), the family, the house and who lives in it, the friends, the community, the toxins, the climate, where the water comes from and where the garbage goes. The patient is the world.
And finally that the “hoof beats” outside the window can be zebras—or, if you listen carefully, just the light steps of a common bird.
What I’ve learned since
I’ve learned that the delivery of good medical care is based on understanding, and communicating with the patient, the risk of isolation, and the healing power of good connection. Doctors now are into their screens, and the best ones are those who can type without looking at the keyboard. The real issue in caring for the patient based on two things:
Connection comes first: if you are in good connection, you can talk about anything; if you’re not in good connection, you can’t talk about anything (this, of course applies to life outside medicine—thnk of your spouse or partner).
It’s never only what you do or say, it’s what you do or say next. No one ever gets connection right all the time, we are always getting it wrong, mostly in little ways. The ones who are great with patients—and with spouses,
partners etc—are those who, when there’s a disconnect, note it, hold it with the other person, and then do something next to turn it into a better connection.
Good relationship, good connection, is the key to good patient care.
And GPs are lucky—you get to actually be with patients in this way.

Heroes: general practice and Karpman’s triangle
Posted by David Misselbrook | 5 Oct 2016 | Arts, Opinion | 0
Living in a different culture is exciting and fascinating. But living in Bahrain we do miss “culture” in its other sense. There is a magnificent National Theatre, usually empty, putting on just a few touring shows a year. The nearest opera house is 500 miles away. But for a small nation it sure has lots of cinemas.
So this evening we went to see Sully, a film by Clint Eastwood. It stars Tom Hanks as the eponymous pilot, Chesley ‘Sully’ Sullenberger, who heroically landed a passenger jet with 155 people on board on the Hudson River in New York following the loss of both engines after bird strike. I wondered how you could make a whole film about this one incident, assuming there would be lots of flashback time to Sully’s youth as a military pilot and his long flying career. But the main theme of the film is how, having pulled off a near miraculous landing on water saving each of the 155 people on board, the incident investigators then treated Sully and his younger co-pilot, Jeff Skiles. It is based on Sullenberger’s own account from his book, Highest Duty.
Within a minute of the investigators’ initial interview with Sully and Skiles starting it was obvious that the assumption was “you must have messed up – our job is to show how”. In moments Sully went from hero to suspect, who risked his passengers’ lives by choosing a reckless water landing rather than other options which “must” have been available. And anyway no twin engine jet had ever lost both engines through bird strike, so the pilots must have been mistaken.
The film follows Sully’s self-doubt, his being overwhelmed by media frenzy whilst trying to process a traumatic event, his imagined “flashbacks” to less happy endings. His wife and family alone at the end of a phone whilst he has to attend the inevitable investigation. Mostly though the film depicts the incredible imbalance of power between one man, doggedly seeking to hold a corner he knows from long experience to be right, against the investigative power of a large well-resourced organization with its absolute confidence that Sully must be wrong. And its annoyance that he makes it hard for them to prove this foregone conclusion.
Perhaps it is time for a confession. One of the many reasons why I left the UK after 35 years as an NHS doctor, was the sense that every year I worked, I and my family gained less from staying. But every year I worked I risked more and more from the career-ending multiple jeopardy and shame to which we are now exposed. The lines crossed several years ago, it just took me a while to work it out. I only once received one of the GMC’s notorious “we haven’t got you this time but we’ll keep an eye on you” letters. And this was for a complaint that a five year old child would have dismissed after the briefest perusal of the facts. Of course, had I been a locum the GMC would have, de facto, already smeared my name to all my places of work – don’t tell me that such letters are a “neutral act”. A close friend took early retirement as he feared the GMC brown envelope every day, for no reason other than the ever increasing background risk. And I also got out before I had the pleasure of a CQC visit.

When I was a trainee I was taught about Karpman’s victim/rescuer/persecutor triangle. The heroic rescuer saves the victim. But this attracts the attention of the persecutor, or often the victim becomes a persecutor. Now the rescuer is the victim. And so the drama unfolds. Rescuing can be dangerous to your health. Have we as a profession become imprisoned by Karpman’s triangle?
But back to the film. If you haven’t yet seen it then look away now. Sully has to demonstrate the failure of simulation to model reality. If a pilot had turned back to the airport at the very moment of bird strike then they might just have made it within the three minutes remaining. But it required 17 simulation attempts to pull it off. However it took 35 seconds to assess the situation and make that decision. And if Sully had followed all prescribed procedures, rather than relying on his experience and judgement, it would have taken longer. But his rapid decision and his consummate skill in landing a passenger jet on water (plus a big dollop of luck) let to everyone on board surviving.
Well, being a film, the investigators grudgingly accept he was a hero. They don’t apologise for their persistent accusations to a man trying to come to terms with a traumatic event – but hey, that would be a fantasy. Similarly you and I have to just live with the knowledge that we did a good job. A better job than we are ever contracted for, because we see ourselves as professionals. It’s enough, but for how long?
Anyway, we’ve just arranged to fly to Muscat to see an opera. But I don’t reckon I’ll be seeing Sully as an inflight movie any time soon. Still, at least I’m safe.

The man in sideroom 2
Posted by BJGP Life | 9 Jan 2018 | Undergraduate | 1
Chloe Webster is a 4th year medical student, a yogaholic, creative writing enthusiast, and an aspiring future GP.
Through the zig-zag maze of the ward, he was in the first room on the left. An odd-shaped room, tucked in tight, just after the double doors. Blink and you miss it. The room was small, but he had made it his own. His coat was hung over the high back of the armchair. The wheeled table cluttered with all his favourite books. This was the first time I met him, but I could tell from his hospital room that he had been here for a very long time. The room had become a home away from home. He was going to die here.
Today was my first day on the ward. I joined my consultant for his morning ward round. A tall, thin man greets me. He always wore practical shoes: a pair of black slip-ons, with his stripy socks pulled up high. His hair is short, and sticks up. The picture ID on his hospital lanyard shows a much younger man, with more hair too. His glasses frame his slender face. His expression was always one of deep understanding. He never said much, but heard more than what was said to him.
We are stood at the nursing station. A cramped alcove budding off from the main part of the ward. It is cluttered with multi-coloured policy folders and loose pieces of paper. The telephone is always ringing. One of the nurses comes over to speak to the consultant.
“The family are here to see you”, she says. He looks up, and nods in response.
We make our way to sideroom 2.
Four of us enter. Now there are six people in the small room. The patient, his wife, the consultant, the registrar, the FY2, and me. I stand in the corner of the room, trying not to get in anyone’s way. I don’t really know what is happening. I simply stand and watch.
The occupant of the room is an elderly gentleman. His face is aged, and an unkempt beard has grown wildly off his jaw. He has teeth missing from years of heavy smoking. He is sat up in the armchair by the side of the bed. He wears a blue, stripy jumper. A blanket is drawn around him, but I can see that he has an above knee amputation. His wife sits opposite him, gracefully perched on a foot rest. The two of them separated by the table in between scattered with books. She is also elderly. Her face is less aged, but I can see she has been crying from the redness of her eyes. Her gaze is fixed down at her husband’s hand held tightly in hers.
I don’t really remember much of what the consultant said at this point. It is a day that I have suppressed to the back of my mind. It is a bad memory.
I’ll never forget his wife crying. Floods of tears streamed down her face. They were told that he wasn’t going to get better, and a time was coming where there would be nothing else that they could do. He was approaching the end of his life. She tried to hold back her emotions, but she couldn’t. She was going to lose her husband. Her grip on his hand tightened. Her husband’s response was very different. He wasn’t sad. He wore a smile across his face. I think this was for his wife’s benefit. He knew that the time was coming. His health had been deteriorating over the past months, fluid was overloading his body. His wife had buried her head in her hands, making her body smaller and smaller as she shrunk in to the foot stool.
I started crying. I drew myself further and further back in to the corner of the room hoping that no one would see me.
I remember the registrar frantically scribbling in the notes, recording every word that the consultant said. The FY2 offered a tissue to the wife, but I just stood there. I started crying. I drew myself further and further back in to the corner of the room hoping that no one would see me. I could hear the true sadness in his wife’s voice. She tried to speak, but her words trembled uncontrollably. It made me so sad to think that soon she would be alone. The FY2 soon noticed me. Tears were beginning to roll down my face. She took me outside. I didn’t go back in to the sideroom. After a few minutes, the others followed and left the room. They simply carried on with the rest of the morning ward round.
A few days later, I returned to my base ward. Without thinking, instinctively I went to the central hub of the nursing station. I looked up at the big whiteboard on the wall, detailing all the current patients. No matter how hard I looked, no matter how many times I double checked, I couldn’t find his name.
I went to the room. The door was wide open, the room was empty.
There was no coat, no pile of books carefully stacked on the table.
He was gone.

Beautifully written – I enjoyed reading it. We must make sure that as the years pass we don’t lose sight of the human story behind the medical problems that are presented to us. In other words, we mustn’t stop caring.

The Future of Medicine
Posted by Roger Jones | 11 Mar 2020 | Opinion
The Changing Face of Medicine project is gathering momentum. As President of the BMA, Professor Pali Hungin launched a project to look into the impact of fast moving technological advances, the shifting role of the doctor, the adequacy of medical education, the nature of public and patient expectations of clinicians, the need for visionary medical leadership, and the well-being of clinicians themselves.

Jerry cross the Mersey: Hunt at the RCGP Conference
Posted by Roger Jones | 13 Oct 2017 | Opinion
Jacket off, shirtsleeved, roving the stage, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt must have said “The truth is…” three times in the first three minutes of his RCGP Conference speech in Liverpool this Thursday. By the standards of recent Tory party speeches this one was pretty good. He thanked GPs for doing a good job and reiterated the mantra “If general practice fails, the NHS fails”.

A video to help patients get the most out of 10 minutes
Posted by BJGP Life | 4 Nov 2019 | Bright Ideas and Innovation | 0
Ed Schwarz has just completed his GP training as an educational scholar in Cornwall and is now a GP in Penzance.
Fed up of running late? Another patient cancelled last minute? Need to examine someone wearing 12 layers?
If we are honest, there are some things that patients do that can add extra time to your consultation. Did you know many patients are not aware their consultation is just 10 minutes? Although there are discussions in place about extending the 10 minute consultation, currently demand means for many practices this is not achievable.
This free video is available for all practices to use on their websites or in their waiting rooms and aims to educate patients about the 10 minute consultation and how to get the most of it. They work well without sound.
It was created as part of a QI project during my Educational Scholar role as an ST3 with finding via HEE.

Why do you want to be a GP? The one question we don’t ask
Posted by BJGP Life | 18 May 2018 | AiT, Opinion | 2
Kirsty Wooff is currently working in Emergency Medicine in the Northern Territory (Australia) but she is heading home in August to begin ST1 of GP training in the West of Scotland.
So why do you want this job?
The first question to practise before a job interview; the one we all know will make an appearance…right?
Well, not if you’ve chosen to pursue a career in general practice. Whilst my colleagues were preparing evidence of their accomplishments and practising expected questions, I was revising for the entrance exam and practising OSCE based scenarios. So why is the entry to GP training so different, and what does that mean for the specialty?
Why is the entry to GP training so different, and what does that mean for the specialty?
The application process for GP training consists of two parts. Part 1 encompasses the written exam testing both clinical knowledge and situational based judgement, part 2 is an OSCE style exam with 3 oral stations and a written station which looks at task prioritisation. According to the OSCE guidance they are looking for participants to demonstrate four key qualities: empathy and sensitivity, conceptual thinking and problem solving, communication skills and professional integrity. Four qualities which are key to being a good doctor, let alone a good GP.
I want to be a GP. I think it can be one of the most rewarding fields of medicine. I’m excited to begin training in a career where I can, hopefully, provide both great quality and continuity of care within the community. The relationship you can build with patients is a really appealing aspect to me as is the idea of being a generalist specialist. Knowing a bit of everything and relying on strong clinical acumen are two key components of being a GP that drew me to the speciality.
I want to be a GP. I think it can be one of the most rewarding fields of medicine… I was ready to tell the world this but then no-one asked me.
I was ready to tell the world this but then no-one asked me. I didn’t expect to be asked by my current colleagues (I’m a young female doctor; I mention GP training and I get a knowing nod…) but I did expect to get asked by my future colleagues – surely they would want to make sure I was committed to GP training for the right reasons and that I might actually add something to the profession?
I was fortunate enough to get a place on the training programme I wanted and I was delighted. I also felt, however, a bit disappointed: did it even matter that I’d actively chosen to become a GP and if the application process was so disinterested in me on a personal level, would the training process be the same?
What I’m advocating for here is one simple question. It doesn’t have to be part of the marking criteria but, by asking it, we’d be changing the way applicants felt.
Why do you want to be a GP? So simple yet so crucial. Not only does it infer that we are interested in the applicant on a more personal level, it also infers that as a speciality we care about who becomes a GP. We want people that want to be GPs. We want people that will make good colleagues. We want people to be proud to be a GP. Surely it’s in our favour to find applicants who have actively chosen to become a GP?
It’s a common flaw within the medical world that GPs aren’t given the recognition or respect that they deserve but how can we expect our non-GP colleagues (and members of the public) to respect us if we don’t treat ourselves with respect.
We don’t ‘fall into’ GP training; we actively choose it as a rewarding and fulfilling career and it’s time we begin to recognise that.

Thanks Kirsty for your article – you make an excellent point. Medicine is in danger of losing the human touch as we are increasingly encouraged to be concerned with applying the correct protocol to the data sat in front of us rather than rsponding to the person that data relates to with care and compassion. Sometimes we need to try and do the good thing that is unmeasurable rather than the measurable accurate thing. We make a mistake when we are only interested in what can be measured and it sounds that this mistake has crept into the selection process too. For what it’s worth I for one am glad you’re heading into General Practice and are doing so for all the right reasons. I wish you well – it indeed a most rwarding job and hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

Thank you Peter. I think I just found the whole selection process impersonal and frustrating and on reflection I felt that just the addition of one simple question would change how it had made me feel – a straightforward solution!

A BJGP Christmas Carol: Part Four
Posted by BJGP Life | 20 Dec 2018 | Stories | 0
Peter Aird is a GP in Bridgwater, Somerset.
This is part four of a five part series. If you can’t wait and like to binge read then you can download the full five part version for free as an epub or mobi file for use with your Kindle or other e-reader.
Stave Four – in which the future appears far from bright
Alone again, Scrooge, out of force of habit, checked his phone for notifications. No red circle had appeared in the corner of the Facebook icon to indicate that someone, somewhere, cared about what was on his mind. This was not unexpected as it had been a long time since anyone had ‘liked’ him – still longer since he’d been loved. It was a surprise to him, therefore, when the phone vibrated alerting him to the arrival of a text message.
‘This is to remind you that your appointment with the Ghost of General Practice Yet To Come is scheduled for now. Please access your QuickFix Health account and prepare to speak to somebody with no soul.’
Scrooge noticed a new app had appeared on his phone’s home screen. It glowed menacingly, demanding to be tapped. Against his better judgement, Scrooge opened the application and was greeted by a disclaimer making it clear that any advice given was only valid for minor, self limiting medical conditions and any harm that resulted from QuickFix clinicians failing to appreciate a more serious underlying problem was not their responsibility.
Those experiencing more complex health concerns were directed to approach less forward thinking health providers. Scrooge was requested to indicate his acceptance of these conditions and, having complied, the screen gave out a burst of light and there then appeared what looked for all the world to be a businessman dressed in an executive suit.
‘Welcome to QuickFix Health,’ the man announced, ‘where your health needs are our business opportunity.’ He smiled a self-satisfied smile, which Scrooge did not find reassuring.
‘Are you the Spirit of General Practice Yet To Come?’ Scrooge enquired.
The spirit’s smile wavered a little. ‘Is that what The Ghost of Christmas Present called me? She is so yesterday. I’ve been rebranded and, from now on, I am to be known simply as ‘The Future’. Exciting isn’t it? Now, how can I profit from you?’
‘I believe you’re supposed to show me my future.’
‘Yes of course, but I don’t have time to talk to you about that in any depth. So, in the interests of efficiency, I’d like to request that you utilise this corporate video feed. If you’ve any further questions you’ll be required to make a further appointment. You will receive an invoice for the services I have provided today and your account will be automatically debited the requisite amount. Thank you for using QuickFix Health. Have a nice day.’
Lost for words, Scrooge tapped the link that had appeared on his phone and continued to gaze at the screen at what seemed to be, if such a thing was possible, a broadcast from the future. It began with an aerial view of a huge featureless building over which an audio commentary played: ‘Welcome to the world’s first fast health outlet – where health is cheap and time is short.’
A notice board at the entrance of the building came into focus revealing that ‘The National Wellbeing Centre’ was open 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year. Two enormous panels straddled the entrance bearing images of the Secretary of State for Health and the President of the National Pharmaceutical Board. They were pictured smiling benignly down upon the multitude who were milling around a large reception area.
As the camera roamed around, the audio commentary explained how no appointment was necessary but that, on arrival, patients were required to utilise electronic panels positioned in the foyer to answer a series of questions by way of ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ answers only. As a result of the responses that were given, each individual would then be assigned to a wellbeing advisor. If, and only if, it was deemed necessary that face to face contact should ensue, they would then wait outside one of the 666 consulting rooms housed within the complex until their allocated interaction was scheduled.
Patients were advised that only objective quantifiable, symptoms could be dealt with and that treatment options would be determined solely on the basis of the medico-economic considerations pertinent to each individual case. Reassurances were offered that a number of payment options were available.
Around the foyer, electronic panels displayed information for consumers alongside a number of company disclaimers:
‘Due to many drugs now being of limited availability, if medication is advised, the sourcing of that medication is entirely the responsibility of the customer.’
‘Please be assured that we respect your anonymity and consider it of paramount importance to maintain the highest levels of confidentiality. In order to guarantee this, no wellbeing advisor will consult with the same client on more than one occasion and no personal communication is permitted between clinicians. A mask can be worn over the face if desired.’
‘The National Wellbeing Centre cannot accept responsibility.’
‘Strict quality control measures are in place to guarantee the optimal outcome of each clinical interaction. Each consultation is electronically monitored and any deviation from company protocols will result in disciplinary action being taken against the clinician concerned.’
The announcements seemed endless, each, it appeared to Scrooge, alienating the individual in need still further from the connection they craved with somebody who just might care enough to show a little concern. Patients were managed without any warmth or compassion – processed by a system that existed solely for the benefit the state that had created it.
As Scrooge continued to watch, the announcements kept flashing across the screens, hypnotising those whose eyes were drawn lifelessly to their incessant messages. Dehumanised, everyone became the same – and that same was nothing more than a reservoir of data.
‘Please be aware that displays of emotion are not encouraged in consultations and tissues are therefore not provided in the consultation rooms.’
‘Customers will not be permitted to leave the centre until the requisite post interaction forms are completed. Not only does the filling of these forms provide the essential feedback necessary to identify suboptimal clinician performance, the personal data requested allows us to identify those agencies from whom we will profit most by our facilitating their communication with you.’
‘Everybody here at the National Wellbeing Centre wishes you, and your purchases, a very merry Consumertide.’
And then, finally, before the cycle of messages started once more, one last announcement:
‘Turmeric is available from the kiosk in the foyer.’
The camera returned to a view of the outside of the building and Scrooge caught a glimpse of a small panel attached to the wall next to the main entrance. He paused the video and expanded the image to take a closer look. He could just make out the words that were inscribed on the ill-maintained copper plate.
‘This facility was erected on the derelict site of what was once known as a GP medical centre. Drs J. Marley and E. Scrooge worked here for many years providing a form of medical provision which today is only of historical interest. The medical centre operated with the quaint intent to provide medical care that was responsive to patient needs. Dr Marley’s untimely death left Dr Scrooge struggling as he found it impossible to replace his former partner.
He continued for a time supported by a series of doctors in training, but, after a personal tragedy struck the medical centre, it was no longer considered fit to remain a training practice. Dr Scrooge continued alone for a brief time, but the pressure of working in such an inefficient manner soon proved too much and he himself succumbed to a stress related illness. Happily, his demise proved the catalyst for the development of the progressive wellbeing centre that we benefit from today.’
Scrooge could not believe what he had witnessed. It struck him that there had at no point been any mention of there being any doctors present in the running of the well-being centre. It was almost as if there was now nobody providing a professional opinion, nobody making a judgement, nobody applying a bit of wisdom and that clinical algorithms were being used to make each and every decision.
Were there, he wondered, any doctors still in existence at all? Perhaps, in the future, nobody wanted to be one. The questions kept coming. Was this really the future of the health service that once, years previously, he had been so proud to be a part? What about Cratchit? What did the “personal tragedy” refer to? And what of his own future? Could any of this be changed?
Scrooge tapped frantically on his phone seeking a further appointment with the Ghost of General Practice Yet To Come. Fortunately, for all the faults of QuickFix Health, having made the appropriate additional payment, an appointment was easy to come by, and soon, the business-like figure of the spectre, who had been so brusque with him earlier, appeared on the screen once more.
‘Good Spirit,’ Scrooge implored, ‘Assure me that I may yet change these shadows you have shown me by an altered life.’
The spirit laughed. ‘It’ll take more than one doctor changing to alter the future of the health service. That’s the trouble with you people. Too often you think it’s all down to you’. The spirit made a poor attempt at a Clint Eastwood impersonation: ‘A doctor’s got to know his limitations.’
‘And besides, what’s your problem? What we’re doing merely reflects the ideology of the nation – that everything comes down to money. We measure and record data because data sells. What we understand at QuickFix Health is that people are commodities. For example, we record an elevated cholesterol solely because we know there is somebody out there who is selling a product to reduce lipid levels and is willing to pay for the information we collect. We don’t care about people, only the wealth that they generate for us.’
‘But it’s not all about money,’ Scrooge insisted.
‘Isn’t it?’ countered the spirit. ‘It seems to me that everyone has a price Dr Scrooge. Are you really the exception?’
‘Well maybe I do have a price, but if I have, it’s at least partly because, in recent years, with so much of the joy having been sucked out of the job, the only way that I’ve been in any way rewarded for my efforts is financially. There’s no appreciation from those who call the tune, no recognition of how difficult the job has become and nothing but constant demands that I must do better. Take appraisal – if a requirement to show year-on-year improvement doesn’t amount to saying that we’re not good enough as we are, I don’t know what is. Something has to change.’
‘Well good luck to you with that, Scrooge. I concede that, as a profession, challenging the status quo rather than capitulating to the spirit of the age whilst all the while laudably endeavouring to deliver its impossible demands would be a step in the right direction. But I can’t see it ever happening – you’re all too busy just trying to keep your head above water to organise a concerted campaign for change.’
‘But let me try, spirit. Let us try. I have learned my lesson well this night. Perhaps things need not turn out the way you have shown me.’
And with that, Scrooge deleted the QuickFix Health app from his phone, never to be installed again. He got back into bed. He’d seen and heard quite enough.

Stave Five – in which we are given cause for hope
It was early morning when Scrooge woke. He sat up in bed and looked around the room. Everything appeared as normal and yet, within himself, he felt changed. Perhaps he was being naive but he felt a sense of optimism that he hadn’t known for years, daring to hope that things could get better.
It was then he remembered it was Christmas Day. ‘At least I think it is,’ he said to himself excitedly, ‘assuming that all three Spirits did indeed visit me last night and that I haven’t missed the great day completely.’ He ran to the window and looked out. A light layer of snow coated the ground which heightened his excitement still further.
And yes, a young lad was trying out a brand new bicycle, no doubt a freshly unwrapped Christmas present. Add to that the fact that one or two folk were making their way towards a church whose bells were ringing joyfully in the distance, it was, with the utmost certainty, Christmas morning.
But there was no time to lose. He had to check on Bob Cratchit. He dressed hurriedly and ran down the stairs and out into the crisp morning sunlight which reflected off the snow-covered ground. Scrooge got into his car and within a few minutes he was outside the house of his trainee. He knocked loudly on the door but there was no answer. He knocked again and, when there was no response, shouted through the letter box. Still there was only silence.
Scrooge moved round to the side of the house and looked through the same window he had the previous evening, its curtains still only partly drawn. Cratchit was sat there, just as he had been when Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Present had left him earlier. Scrooge hammered on the window until, at last, he saw movement and a wave of relief surged through him. Slowly Cratchit stood up.
‘Open up Bob. Open up this instant. Do you hear?’ Scrooge shouted at him though the glass. ‘Open up. It’s Christmas Day!’
Cratchit, clearly half asleep and still the worse for the half bottle of whisky he’d drunk the night before, gradually stood up and made his way to the front door. Scrooge had never been one for outward displays of affection, but now, as Cratchit opened the door, Scrooge greeted him with a hug that was as welcome as it was unexpected.
‘How are you Bob? Are you alright?’
‘I’ve a bit of a headache if I’m honest. And not one that’s improved any by all your hollering. But why are you here? Has something happened? Have I done something wrong?’
‘On the contrary. If anyone is at fault it’s me, for not appreciating you more. And to show you that I mean it, what do you say to a partnership come August when you’ve completed your training? I’d be proud to call you my partner.’
‘You must be desperate!’
‘Desperate? Of course I’m desperate! Have you seen the state of the health service? But that’s not the reason for my offering you a partnership. I would like you to help me change the way we do General Practice. It’s a conditional offer of course – conditional that is on you seeing some change. There’s no way I’d want you to commit to a lifetime of working the way we have of late.’
‘Well I guess I’ll have to think about it. But thank you. I didn’t realise that you thought I was up to the job.’
‘Of courses you’re up to the job. We all worry sometimes that we’re not though, so don’t be surprised if you find yourself questioning the fact – that’s normal! The trouble is that we’re all so anxious imaging that we have to be perfect. We’re not God you know – even though both the government and our patients sometimes expect us to act as though we were.’
‘Well I guess you’re right there.’
‘Of course I’m right, I’m your trainer! Now, what’s with the whisky and the packet of antidepressants?’
Cratchit looked down at the ground. ‘I didn’t take any, just thought about it. I guess I was just feeling a little overwhelmed. I was being stupid.’
‘It’s not stupid to feel overwhelmed. There’s no shame in being asked to do more than you can cope with. The only foolish thing is to not realise you need to say ‘No’ sometimes – that sometimes you need help and have to ask for it. I’ll try and make that easier for you from now on. Promise me though that you’ll not let your thoughts travel in such a dark direction again without letting me know.’
‘I’ll try not to – I promise.’
‘Excellent. Remember, we’re in this together.’
Cratchit couldn’t quite believe what he was hearing and couldn’t stop himself voicing the question that was on his mind.’
‘Dr Scrooge,’ Cratchit began.
‘It’s Ebenezer. Call me Ebenezer.’
Cratchit hesitated and then tried again. ‘Ebenezer,’ it seemed strange to hear the name spoken aloud, ‘I hope you don’t mind me saying this, but something seems different about you today. Has something happened?’
‘I rather think it has,’ said Scrooge. ‘As a profession we’re convinced everything’s wrong. A lot is of course, but I see now that if we can see what the problems are, then surely we stand a chance of making changes.’
‘But how?’
‘To be honest, I’m not quite sure. One thing would be our need to challenge the idea that medicine has all the answers. We need to say ‘No’ to the over-medicalisation of life and be honest with both ourselves and our patients as to what we can and can’t do. Another thing would be that we have to be allowed to behave as the professionals we were trained to be. Once we were seen as people who could be trusted to make judgments in the best interests of patients. Now it seems we are seen as mere service providers, required to unquestionably follow guidelines regardless of how appropriate or otherwise that might be.’
‘It’s as if we’re not considered competent to try to decide what is best for our own individual patients. But one size doesn’t fit all. And so we need to fight to retain the doctor patient relationship that underpins good general practice and not allow it to be lost in the rush to conveyer belt medicine. We have to take back control over our work, make our own decisions as to how to apply medical knowledge to each individual situation and have the courage to resist the inappropriate demand to behave in ways that are imposed on us by government, pharmaceutical companies and society as a whole.’
‘That would mean better health for our patients and happier working lives for ourselves. That’s something I can aspire too, and knowing what it is I’m aiming for might just give me a chance of fathoming out how I might go about working towards it. At least, that’s my hope.’
Scrooge, in his excitement, had been pacing around the room. Now, pausing for breath, he sat down.
‘But that’s enough of all that for now. We can get together tomorrow and plan then just how exactly we’re going to do things differently. We’ll call it a practice away day. Just think of all the CPD hours we can claim! So, what are your plans for today?’
‘Well I had planned on a spot of revising for the CSA.’
‘Revising for the CSA. What nonsense – you’d pass that tomorrow with your eyes closed. Like it or not, you’re spending the day with me! We’ll have dinner at my house. I ordered a lorry load of food from Waitrose last week and there’s no way I can manage it all on my own. In fact there’s more than enough for two. Quick, go and get yourself sorted out. I’ve got an idea – one that might, for the first time in my career, satisfy my appraiser that my reflections have altered my practice!’
It wasn’t long before Cratchit was sat in the passenger seat of Scrooge’s car wondering where Scrooge might be taking him. A few minutes later they pulled up outside a block of flats and Scrooge led the way up the steps to the second floor. He knocked on a door.
‘Who lives here?’ asked Cratchit.
‘Mrs Gray. She’s lived here alone since her husband, Timothy, died a few years ago. He was a short man. He had some kind of growth hormone deficiency I believe.’
Eventually, the door opened, and Mrs Gray stood there, evidently astonished to see her GP.
‘Good morning Mrs Gray. And a very merry Christmas to you.’
‘Well a very merry Christmas to you too Dr Scrooge. But what brings you here? Is it about the chocolates?’
‘Certainly not. We, that’s Dr Cratchit and I, have come to pick you up and take you off to my house for Christmas Day. What do you say? Will you come?’ Mrs Gray hesitated, uncertain if she should.
‘Please come, Mrs Gray. It would mean a lot to me.’
‘But I’ve nothing to bring.’
Scrooge looked over her shoulder and saw the box of chocolates on the kitchen table. ‘What about those?’ Scrooge asked, ‘You don’t have to bring anything, but if you’d like to make a contribution…’
‘But I’m pre-diabetic Dr Scrooge, I need to be careful what I eat.’
‘Who told you that?’ said Scrooge, a broad grin forming on his face. ‘Not a doctor I hope. Believe me Mrs Gray, you shouldn’t believe everything we doctors tell you!’
With that, Mrs Gray tottered to the kitchen, picked up the chocolates and made her way back to the front door. Then, together with Scrooge and Cratchit, she made her way slowly down the stairs. Halfway down, Scrooge stopped.
‘You go on Bob, I’ll catch you up in a moment. It’s just that I have a feeling that, as a GP, I am, for once, ideally positioned to reduce hospital admissions.’
He ran back up the stairs and knocked on the door of the flat opposite that of Mrs Gray. A man opened the door.
‘I don’t want to appear interfering,’ Scrooge began, ‘but your son will develop a rash later this morning. When he does, try wiping it off with a damp cloth. Trust me, I’m a doctor!’
With that Scrooge turned and headed off back down the stairs leaving the man speechless behind him.
—
A couple of hours later, the two doctors and their elderly patient sat around a dining table enjoying
Waitrose’s finest. As the meal drew to a close, Cratchit turned to Scrooge.
‘I think I’ve made my decision’ he said.
‘What decision is that?’
‘I’d like to accept your offer of a partnership, if I pass the CSA that is.’
‘That’s wonderful Bob, simply wonderful!’ Scrooge stood up and shook Crachit warmly by the hand and then, for the second time in the day, embraced him warmly. ‘This is excellent news – for me and for the practice. We should organise a party!’
Scrooge dashed out of the room and returned with a sheet of paper on which were listed all the practice staff, their names and telephone numbers.
‘And a party we shall have,’ declared Scrooge handing the list to Cratchit. ‘Start ringing round and invite anyone who’s free to join us here this evening. Perhaps someone will bring some of those Prosecco and pink peppercorn Pringles – are they really a thing? Only don’t let me drink too much. The last time I did that there was an incident at a local supermarket, the details of which you don’t want to know!’
‘Can I say something Dr Scrooge?’ Scrooge turned around and saw that Mrs Gray had got to her feet. With one hand she steadied herself by holding onto the table and with the other she was holding a glass of wine. ‘I’ve had a lovely time today and I want to thank you for all your kindness. I’d like to propose a toast, to both of you, the practice, and the NHS as a whole. It’s something my late husband used to say.’ She raised her glass higher. ‘God bless us, every one,’ she said.
‘God bless us, every one,’ repeated Scrooge and Cratchit, smiling as they raised and carefully tapped together their glasses.
—
In time, Cratchit passed his CSA and joined Scrooge in partnership and when Scrooge came to retirement he did so reluctantly. He considered himself to have been a fortunate man to have had the career he did. Cratchit continued on, the practice grew and new partners were appointed. Though their processes and procedures didn’t always meet with the full approval of the CQC, the partners always enjoyed strong support from their practice population.
Scrooge’s experiences that night may not have changed the state of the NHS as a whole, but they did change how the NHS was manifested in one small corner of that great organisation. Scrooge never had any further encounters with spirits – he had no need of them. Afterwards it was always said of him that he was a doctor who cared for his patients more than he cared how he was thought of by people in power and that he knew how to support others and how he needed support of others himself. May that be truly said of us all.
And so, as Mr Gray observed, ‘God Bless Us, Every One!’

Women in medicine: increasing in numbers but not regard
by Emily Bailey | Mar 8, 2020 | Opinion | 0
Throughout the last century we have witnessed major advancements for women in the UK, but gender inequalities continue to exist in the workplace. The NHS, established with the intent to treat everyone equally, is no exception. On average, female GPs — who now make up more than half of our workforce — continue to feel undervalued, hold less senior roles, and receive lower pay when compared to men.

My first year as a GP physician associate
by BJGP Life | Feb 26, 2020 | Opinion | 0
When I first qualified as a physician associate (PA), I had no intention to work in general practice, at least until later in my career. I was unsure of the impact a PA could have in a GP setting prior to the much anticipated statutory regulation and associated prescribing rights. Having a physician associate within the practice has meant greater accessibility to appointments, less pressure on the on-call doctor, and improved prescribing rates in certain areas.

BJGP Long Read: Mistakes and responsibilities
Posted by Peter Aird | 10 Dec 2019 | BJGP Long Read | 0
Peter Aird is a GP in Bridgwater, Somerset.
This week I recalled a study day that I went to some years ago. Suitably interactive, involving a variety of teaching styles and fully addressing a personally relevant learning need, it was the best educational event that I’ve ever attended. Given how excellent it was, you might be surprised to hear that I did not claim any CPD points for being there. The reason for this, seemingly schoolboy, error was, however, simply this – it was a Speed Awareness Course.
The day began with the leader asking for a show of hands from all those present who’d told friends and family that they were attending the course that day. Most hands went up, as did the corners of many people’s mouths, their smiles suggesting that few, if any, were ashamed at having been required to be there. The leader then pointed out that breaking the speed limit was no less likely to cause a road traffic accident than driving whilst over the legal blood alcohol limit. He then asked how many people would have told friends and family they were on the course had it been run for those who had committed a drink driving offence. You’ll not be surprised to learn that no hands went up. Later in the day, those gathered were asked to list the reasons why, on occasions, they might drive faster than the law permitted. A substantial list was generated. A short recording was then played of a man describing how his child had been killed by a speeding motorist. The leader then commented how our list, made up of what we had felt were potentially justifiable reasons for speeding, now seemed like nothing but a collection of weak excuses. It was a highly effective learning experience.
Over the years I have made mistakes as a doctor.
I was reminded of all this whilst discussing with a friend how we cope with our failures. We tend to be uncomfortable accepting that we sometimes make mistakes and so, when we do err, we are want to try to preserve our spotless image, either by relativising our failures such that there are not really seen as failures at all or, alternatively, justifying them by insisting they were understandable given the circumstances at the time. Over the years I have made mistakes as a doctor, some of which have had significant consequences for patients and I am conscious of having adopted both these approaches in an attempt to preserve an image of myself that I am comfortable with, one in keeping with what I perceive a doctor should be, specifically that of one who is immune to error. What the speed awareness course taught me was just how inappropriate and foolish both these approaches really are.
In the Spiderman films, Peter Parker is warned by his Uncle Ben that ‘with great power comes great responsibility’. As health professionals, the power that we have over our patients may not be equivalent to that of a superhero, I trust none of us are that arrogant, but it is still significant. And so, regardless of how uncomfortable it may make us feel, we have to take responsibility for what we do.
That sometimes means owning my mistakes and feeling the genuine regret of not being as good a doctor as others need me to be.
For me, as a doctor, that sometimes means owning my mistakes and feeling the genuine regret of not being as good a doctor as others need me to be. This isn’t, I trust, an exercise in self pity that forgets who it is who has suffered most as a consequence of my mistakes, but simply an honest acknowledgment of the reality of the sadness that my inevitable mistakes bring to myself as well as others. Though it would be kind of you to do so, please don’t try to reassure me by telling me I’m ‘good enough’. Because, as a doctor, as in every area of my life, it simply isn’t always the case. Though sometimes, of course, I am good enough, maybe even most of the time, sometimes, really, I am seriously not. Because the truth is that I make mistakes – real mistakes that really matter, mistakes for which there are no mitigating circumstances sufficient to absolve me of the responsibility for what I have done.
I don’t believe I am alone.
Of course, some of the errors we all make are indeed the result of the unreasonable demands of the job but, however loudly we may shout about how hard the job can be, we know that it is not always the case. And so we cannot drown out the words that we continue to whisper to ourselves, words that tell us that we could have done better, words that we know are, at least sometimes, true.
So what then? How are we to cope when we fail?
Given that I am in a confessional mood with regard to my history of driving offences, let me tell you about something else that happened to me some years ago. One sunny afternoon, I was merrily driving along the North Devon Relief Road on my way to visit my parents. when I noticed a police car following on behind. It was flashing its somewhat ostentatious blue lights at me. Well, I thought, I’d better stop and see if the police officer concerned wanted any help with his enquiries. And you know what – he did! In fact, so keen was he to have my assistance, that he invited me to step out of my car and join him in his.
Now I should point out that at this point I had no idea what he wanted to talk to me about. Perhaps, I wondered, it was simply that he was rather proud of his car and just wanted to show me how much better it was compared to mine! Because better it most certainly was – it even had a built-in camera which he delighted to demonstrate, by replaying the footage he had taken of my driving too close to the car in front me for the previous four miles. ‘Only a fool,’ he said, ‘breaks the two second rule’ and though I hadn’t appreciated it at the time, I realise now that he was, by implication, saying that a fool was what I was. He then went on to tell me that my crime of ‘driving without due care and attention’ was worthy of a court appearance and six points on my licence. I was somewhat taken aback.
When I make a mistake I am not comforted by the profession closing ranks around me.
Now, whilst I could have tried at that point to argue that my offence wasn’t really as bad as all that, or attempted to come up with some mitigating factors to justify why I had been driving the way I had, it would have done me no good. It was the proverbial ‘fair cop’. And so I simply apologised, hoping against hope that he might show me some leniency. And, amazingly, he did. Without the need to beg, or indeed cry, and for reasons I still don’t really understand, he let me off, simply urging me to drive more carefully in the future. I suppose you could say he forgave me!
I don’t know about you, but when I make a mistake I am not comforted by the profession closing ranks around me and insisting that I am OK – not when, deep down, I know that I’m not. Neither, as some suggest, can I make myself feel better by ‘forgiving myself’ for the harm I have done to others since, surely, only those so harmed can possibly forgive me for what I have done to them. What has helped though, far more so than the actions of that kindly police officer one Sunday afternoon on the A361, is when, having apologised to a patient for my mistake, my apology has been graciously accepted. Though the harm done remains, and the regret remains real, it helps me to carry on knowing that my error is no longer held against me – that I’m accepted despite my faults. Recently there was an article in the newspapers saying that kind doctors had healthier patients. Be that as it may, what is more certain still is that kind patients have healthier, and happier, doctors.
Of course though, not all patients will be so forgiving – that is their right. What then?
Well, if it’s hard to have made mistakes that are forgiven, then it’s harder still to have made
mistakes that aren’t. To live with the knowledge that our actions have harmed another who, not unreasonably, continues to hold it against us is, I’m afraid, part of the job. So when our turn comes, it may just help a little to know that it’s something we all will experience at some point in our careers.
Because to sometimes fail is normal.
I know how reassuring it was for me when, as a still relatively young GP, a highly respected senior colleague of mine spoke of how he also knew what it was to experience the pain and regret of having made mistakes. Though at that time the mistake was mine, it helped to know that mine was not the only mistake. Though I still knew sadness and regret, it helped that sadness and regret was not only mine to know.
We should instead acknowledge our ordinariness and quietly accept one another.
And so, rather than tending towards protesting, sometimes a little too much, how wonderful we all are, we should instead acknowledge our ordinariness and quietly accept one another, not on account of how marvellous we manage to portray ourselves to be, but rather on the basis that we all know ourselves to be less than perfect. As well as great responsibility, we need to appreciate that, with great power comes the need for great personal honesty, regardless of how painful the truth we consequently have to face might be.
The problem is, of course, that we are all only human. For me, the answer to that problem, isn’t to find self-acceptance by considering myself ‘good enough’ since it is patently obvious to me that, on occasions at least, I’m not. Nor do I believe I do others a favour by trying to convince them when they fail that they remain ‘good enough’ since to do so only burdens them with the endless struggle of pretending to be what they know, all too well, they’re not either. Personally, I need to know the security that comes from being accepted, not on the basis of who I pretend to be, but who I really am, not as a result of being a perfect doctor but rather because someone, who despite knowing I fall well short of that ideal, accepts me just the same. Perhaps you do to.
For this is love.
We are fortunate indeed if we know such unconditional acceptance supporting us when times are hard, but to expect it within the workplace is perhaps unrealistic given that professional standards need to be maintained and the public has to be protected. Nonetheless, within the profession, were we to care for each other with a healthy appreciation of our limitations, what Atul Gawande calls our ‘necessary fallibility’, not only would it alleviate the burden felt by those who imagine everyone else is performing so much better than they are themselves, but it would also surely bring about the more nurturing environment required if we are to see ourselves becoming the better doctors we all so long to be.
But for that to happen we are going to have to stop pretending that mistakes are only made by those anonymous others that we read about in the paper – those who allow us to feel better about ourselves by being there for us to collectively look down upon. Instead we need to be honest enough to admit that it is we who sometimes make mistakes, that each of us are just ordinary, and that none of us are all that we’re sometimes cracked up to be.
That is the truth, at least it is for me.

Enthusiasm, inspiration and pride at the RCGP Annual Conference
Posted by BJGP Life | 22 Nov 2019 | Opinion | 0
Dr Katie Barnett is a Post CCT Fellow with Haxby Group Practice in York and an Honorary Clinical Fellow in the Department of Health Sciences at the University of York. She is on Twitter @drkatiebarnett1 and blogs about wellbeing and fellowship at: Thefellowshipmonologues.wordpress.com
So why should I go to the RCGP Annual Conference…
I can summarise it in 3 words: Enthusiasm, Inspiration and Pride.
Sometimes in primary care we can get isolated. It can feel like the wheels just keep turning and Proud Mary keeps on burning … the candle at both ends. It is easy to lose the wins amongst the negative chatter. It is easy to lose your patience for your patients while thinking about the tasks piling up. It can feel like a pressure cooker of emotional and intellectual labour, just waiting for a swing and a missed diagnosis. With the media adding fuel to the fire. Mainstream talking about GPs missing signs of cancer, dementia, heart failure, depression and everything else they know nothing about. GP magazines talking about burnout and crises and snowflakes and all the while patients wait three weeks for a routine appointment.
I’ll be honest, I have a bit of an ostrich tendency. Stop reading about it and it can’t impact me, stop talking to my colleagues and I won’t hear about how terrible it is… but then the loneliness and cynicism sets in.
And it certainly got my head out of the sand.
Going to an event like the RCGPAC can bring together people from all walks of life, from the deep end practices of Glasgow, to the leafy suburbs or York, from the rural wilds of North Wales, to the inner city impoverished super practices of Birmingham, from medical students to retired GP’s, from Matt Hancock to Becky Malby. And it certainly got my head out of the sand.
Having an event that celebrates our diversity of thoughts, ideas, people and talent is something I think we should be incredibly proud of. The event celebrates everything good with general practice and allows people to connect and learn from one another in a positive and nurturing environment. I attended workshops about art and wellbeing, greener practice, burnout in the wider team, new models of practice, developing research interests and consulting with vulnerable patients (to name a few). I came away inspired to try these changes in my own practice. At my practice we are now looking at ways we can be more green, ways we can improve long term condition management by utilising the wider workforce and bringing in a wellbeing policy with mentors at each site, including the whole team.
And that is just from the breakout sessions. The plenaries genuinely brought tears to my eyes. Jamie Hynes ‘If’ ​poem​, and Roger Neighbours ‘Humankind Ness’ talk gave me that hard to explain feeling of ‘yes. this. so much this.’ Sir Michael Marmot, chosen by President Mayur Lakhani to provide the John Hunt lecture for this year, spoke with passion about social inequality still being the greatest barrier to good healthcare. He empowered us to take this knowledge to our communities and fight for those with less by trying to close the gap between rich and poor and think about how we can provide healthcare for those who do not seek it but for whom it can have the greatest impact. Prof Becky Malby spoke with amazing energy about the myths surrounding what primary care needs and following the evidence rather than the policies. As the talk directly following the health secretary Matt Hancock, and his policy driven talk of video consultations based on limited evidence, this was a fantastic juxtaposition.
Encouraging us to call out the inappropriate negativity in our own ranks.
But my favourite moment of the whole conference was Helen Stokes-Lampard’s moving address where she spoke about nurturing the young generation, about hope for the future and promoting support and empowerment of the whole primary care team, not just doctors. Encouraging us to call out the inappropriate negativity in our own ranks, to collaborate and foster relationships that encourage us to succeed, not to clip our wings with cynicism. To be superhero GP’s and have faith that the one thing that will never change is the power of the doctor-patient relationship and the place we hold in the hearts of our communities. To use this to bring our profession through the turmoil we are facing and into a future filled with promise and hope. She choked up with passion and pride. And so did I, and many other people in the audience.
After the conference my overarching thoughts about my job are those of pride, not negativity. I will find patience because we are moving in a direction where I will have the time. I will be kind to my team, because they are facing the same pressures as me. I am filled with renewed vigor for the profession I love, and the patient care I provide. I came into this profession wanting to build relationships that help people. Why medicine? The perfect combination of art and science. Why general practice? I meet on average 30 new people a day, hear their problems, seek to work with them to find solutions, and build a relationship on which they may find their why. It’s an absolute privilege, and I never want to lose that.
Working together and leading each other with kindness, enthusiasm and pride.
I feel as though we have the potential to change the landscape, systematically and individually for our patients. Because it is already happening: we are expanding the primary care workforce to include a huge number of our colleagues from secondary care including paramedics and physios, we are developing new roles to help bring social solutions into our arsenal, we are finding digital solutions to the difficulty with access to primary care. We are developing areas of our practice to help fight climate change, schemes to recycle inhalers, cycle for home visits, reduce our paper use and reduce our carbon footprint. We are working on resilience. Not just individually but systemically, so when one person is struggling the whole thing doesn’t come collapsing down behind them, no one person should have the entire weight on their shoulders, like the final piece that causes the collapse in Jenga.
If, as our inspirational chair Helen Stokes Lampard says, we play Lego instead of Jenga, we can build a future where we can provide the level of care we strive for, where we enjoy going to work because we have the headspace to think around the tricky problems, and people surrounding us who help us through the tough times and celebrate the good times with us. Working together and leading each other with kindness, enthusiasm and pride. All of which were cultivated and celebrated at a hugely enjoyable conference with friends and colleagues. I can’t wait for next year.
We have been surviving individually. Now it’s time to thrive together.

BJGP Student Writing Competition – the winner
Posted by BJGP Life | 20 Jul 2015 | Opinion, Undergraduate | 1
Lydia Yarlott is in her final year at Oxford Medical School.
She is the winner of the 2015 BJGP Student Writing Competition themed ‘The GP in the Digital Age’ with her original article A Digital Ache.
Her tale of one GP versus the system will be horribly familiar to anyone who has done battle with the new digital bureaucracy of the NHS. It’s a rather wonderful reminder of the fundamental importance of maintaining relationships between doctors to benefit patients. The PDF version is embedded below – it needs the formatting to get the full benefit. Enjoy.

Evolving General Practice: Artificial Intelligence and Primary Care
Posted by BJGP Life | 7 Jan 2019 | Bright Ideas and Innovation | 0
RCGP Report on AI
The Clinical Innovation and Research Centre (CIRC) at the RCGP works with GPs and practice staff, supporting them to deliver a better quality and level of care to their patients through a wide portfolio of projects. Find out more at https://www.rcgp.org.uk/clinical-and-research.aspx.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a hotly discussed topic for several years and has more recently been discussed in healthcare. There are articles on the potential impact for AI to completely change current approaches and replace people, causing widespread job loses.
In June 2017 the House of Lords appointed a committee to “consider the economic, ethical and social implications of advances in artificial intelligence”. The findings of the Committee were published in a report in April 2018. It was reported that AI has potential to replace jobs but, importantly, enhance many jobs and create new ones. At the end of 2017, the government also released the industry strategy white paper which presented AI and Data Economy as one of the four Grand Challenges facing the UK. In early 2018, the Wellcome Trust commissioned a report on AI focusing on healthcare highlighting many of the challenges facing AI.
The digital doctor powered by AI is a common feature of articles on AI and healthcare. However, there are still substantial technical developments needed before a digital doctor becomes possible. Possibly the biggest technical challenge is that AI is very good at doing a very specific task but struggles as tasks become broader.
But people, unlike machines, are good at empathy and relationships.
AI is already being used to support healthcare delivery, machines, unlike people, have a great capability for analysing vast amounts of data and looking for patterns. These can be used to provide answers to very specific queries. But people, unlike machines, are good at empathy and relationships. This approach where healthcare professionals use AI powered tools is still in its infancy but has potential to impact care provision. What is unclear is the best way for AI and healthcare professionals to work together to improve the deliver of healthcare.
The RCGP has released a report on artificial intelligence and primary care. The report aims to demystify what artificial intelligence is and the limitations and questions surrounding the use of AI in healthcare. It outlines the role of a professional body in supporting AI while safeguarding patients and supporting healthcare professionals to ensure the best possible care is provided.
The first in a series of reports can be found at the RCGP’s new page, Evolving General Practice.
For more information on our reports, please contact the Innovation Team at circ@rcgp.co.uk.

Delphi and the current path of Western culture
by David Misselbrook | Jun 7, 2018 | International | 0
I have just come back from the centre of the world. Not the centre of the earth of course. No, in ancient times the centre of the world was reckoned to be Delphi. This claim was evidence based. If we do not articulate our values and construct a world where freedom, tolerance, fairness and human dignity win the day then the west has no moral high ground from which to lecture the rest of the world. The west has rested on its smug moral superiority for far too long.

Gulf culture, social eating and health
by David Misselbrook | Mar 5, 2018 | International | 0
Bahrain has sometimes been called a string of shopping malls calling itself a country. This is quite a blinkered view. Bahrain is in fact a string of shopping malls and restaurants calling itself a country. Does it matter if we don’t eat together anymore? There are various markers to suggest that it does, particularly for children. The OECD state that students who do not regularly eat with their parents are significantly more likely to truant from school, and this correlates with school performance. And according to the 2014 European Congress on Obesity, children who do not eat dinner with their parents at least twice a week were 40 percent more likely to be overweight.

Diagnosing dementia in younger people: A decision-making guide for GPs
Posted by BJGP Life | 26 Jun 2018 | Clinical | 0
Shona Lucitt (right) is currently studying for a Masters in Public Health at Imperial College London. She previously worked at the Alzheimer’s Society supporting a pilot project for people living with YOD. More recently she has been working for Public Health England in cancer analysis.
Melanie Davis-­Hall (left) is a GP trainee on the Imperial VTS scheme and editorial fellow at the BJGP.
A typical story
“I knew something was wrong, I just didn‘t know what. Maybe it’s just me, I thought, maybe I’m a bit stressed.”
“I knew something was wrong, I just didn‘t know what. Maybe it’s just me, I thought, maybe I’m a bit stressed. I did have a lot on at work. I’d always been really on the ball and ahead of time but things were taking me twice as long, particularly when it came to writing anything. I simply couldn’t find the words, and those I could remember, I couldn’t spell anymore. I even forgot how to use the photocopier I’d used for years, it was so embarrassing. I began to gradually lose my confidence.
Life went on like this for over 2 years, with things becoming more and more difficult. It put particular strain on my relationships as I avoided going out anywhere, particularly somewhere new and seeing my friends became impossible as I struggled to follow the kind of conversations I had before. I inevitably became more isolated and was treated for depression for 6 months before I was referred to a memory clinic. In the end, my wife insisted on coming to see the GP with me. When he asked her what life was like she replied ‘It‘s like living with a 90 year old‘. I was only 49.
Although it sounds strange to say, being diagnosed was a bit of a relief. For a long time, I thought I was going crazy, but I finally had an explanation. I could now understand why I was experiencing symptoms that most people my age won’t ever experience. I describe my life now as ‘sunshine and clouds’. If the clouds appear, everyday life can be a bit tricky in that moment. Yet, when they clear, I make the most of it by doing the things I still enjoy – albeit with a bit of extra support! Whilst life can be challenging, I live everyday as it comes.”
Young onset dementia
Many people think of dementia as a disease of old age. How would it feel to be diagnosed with dementia in your 50s or even your 40s? There are 42,000 people with young onset dementia (YOD) in the UK (1). They experience symptoms of dementia under 65 years old and the time required to get a confirmed diagnosis can be long and frustrating. It takes almost twice as long to be diagnosed as someone with late onset dementia (LOD).
This equates to 4.4 years and research has highlighted the challenges ‘with almost three clinicians consulted […] before a diagnosis’ is made (2, 3).
How does young onset dementia present?
Symptoms of YOD manifest themselves differently, making dementia in younger people more difficult to diagnose (4). Behaviours such as confusion and forgetfulness are often incorrectly put down to symptoms of stress, depression, or the menopause in women (5). Those with YOD frequently have less common forms of dementia such as familial Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia, with behavioural and language changes sometimes the first noticeable symptoms (4,6).
People with YOD are of working age, often living physically active lives, many with dependent children and financial commitments, making diagnosis dramatically life changing. Recognition and diagnosis are the first essential steps not only to enable access to treatment, but to support younger people to live well with dementia.
Young Dementia UK and a guide for GPs
Young Dementia UK is a charity that exists for one reason – ‘to help people whose lives are affected by young onset dementia’ (1) In collaboration with GPs, the Young Dementia Network – a community of people living with YOD, their friends and family,
as well as professionals who work in dementia and social care – have developed a decision-making guide for GPs centred on ‘diagnosing dementia in younger people’.
The charity believes the guide will increase the awareness of GPs on the wide-ranging symptoms of this relatively rare condition and will support conversations on the subject between GPs and their patients. The first version of the guide was created in early 2017 and was piloted online for 4 months. Over 70 feedback surveys about the guide were received from GPs, health and social care professionals, and people living with YOD and their families. Following this, the guide was amended, and the updated version is now available online.
The guide acknowledges that picking up the symptoms and signs of YOD is not easy and can, at times, be based on gut feeling.
Dr Jill Rasmussen, who is a GP in Surrey and Clinical Representative for Dementia at the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), reviewed the guide. She commented, “It is early days yet but Commissioners are beginning to appreciate that their pathway for dementia patients needs to consider the needs of YOD” and also a subset of this group, people with Learning Disabilities, of which “50% will develop dementia by age 60”.
Dr Rasmussen has approached NHS Digital to see if research can be undertaken nationally to look at how effective the guide has been in increasing the rates of diagnosis and referral but suggests that more needs to be done. In particular, she would like to see more help for GPs with “a reference person in each Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP) or Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) to whom they can address questions”.
Fundamentally, the guide acknowledges that picking up the symptoms and signs of YOD is not easy and can, at times, be based on gut feeling. This is reflected in the initial screening questions. The guide also encourages the involvement of family and friends who can help to build a better picture of the symptoms patients are experiencing and how their life is affected.
Examples of symptoms and the ways in which they may manifest or prompt a visit to the doctor are included. These are grouped under useful headings and serve as visual reminders of the range of presentations, with memory and disorientation being just one of them. Before referring a patient to a young dementia service, the guide additionally highlights the need to consider other and possibly co-existing diagnoses in a holistic review.
This guide cleverly raises awareness and teaches GPs about YOD whilst addressing the needs of patients and family members. It is easy to follow, focusing both on the identification of ‘red flags’ but also the subtler signs and symptoms which can be insidious and are often only noticed by close relatives or friends. In the current climate where it can be difficult to see your preferred GP and with continuity of care becoming more difficult, the guide is a crucial tool to recognising the early changes in people with young onset dementia and helping people come to terms with their condition.

The stressed but not ‘mentally ill’: How can we actually help?
Posted by BJGP Life | 23 Sep 2019 | Clinical | 0
Rosie Marshall is a GP based in Wiltshire.
General practice routinely involves supporting patients presenting with diverse manifestations of stress. This can be a challenging issue for clinicians to manage because by definition there are underlying circumstances (sometimes related to complex and systemic problems, often beyond the scope of the individual) that ultimately need to be changed, and of course we have no magic wand for this. This can feel, to me, like an elephant in the consultation room. Where presentations appear to be an understandable and rational reaction to challenging circumstances, are standard medical approaches to mental illness the best way forward or do we need to expand our skill set?
Caused by material or existential factors, stress is of course inevitable in life. When our coping resources are exceeded by prolonged or high impact exposure, the potential impacts can be profound, including severe mental as well as physical illness. But not every stressed person is suffering from mental illness. It is unsurprising that the issue sparks confusion when the specialists are still in dispute about what mental illness is. Publication of the American Psychiatric Association’s revised DSM-5 in 2013 stirred considerable controversy, with many in the psychiatry and psychology worlds arguing that diagnostic criteria were being lowered to the point of incorporating part of the normal spectrum of human emotional life. All but the severest manifestations of stress will likely be encountered by GPs rather than psychiatrists (if the patient presents to a medical professional at all), and we are unlikely to spend time agonising over categorisation systems. From a practical perspective, we know there is a complicated relationship between wellness/illness and the presence or absence of symptoms.
It can still be difficult to differentiate between a ‘normal’ response, and mental illness, being subjective even within one cultural context.
In the current version of ICD-10, ‘stress’ occurring in the absence of a singular crisis-level event would fall under adjustment disorder. This is defined as a state of emotional disturbance arising from a significant life change or stressful event. The DSM-5 definition of adjustment disorder specifies that the distress present is out of proportion to the severity of the stressor and beyond cultural expectations of a normal response. Similar to the contentious issue of bereavement, it can still be difficult to differentiate between a ‘normal’ response, and mental illness, being subjective even within one cultural context. This can feel more like an art than a science.
Outside the diagnostic remit of adjustment disorder (or PTSD/acute stress reaction), stress seems to be a grey area in terms of management guidelines, although numerous mental health charities are (quite rightly) telling individuals to visit their GP when stressed. The question is, when people come seeking help, what tools do we have to offer meaningful assistance, rather than a ‘band-aid’ approach to managing the symptoms of stress? I am not proposing to offer management guidance but rather consideration of the issue.
Identifying a stressor and fixing it to alleviate symptoms may present a straightforward process. More often, finding a solution is complicated and may feel unachievable. Attempting to directly confront the challenges in an individual’s reality can seem uncomfortable or inappropriate because we know it is not necessarily easy for them to actually make changes. Their agency will often be limited by numerous material and psycho-social factors, some well beyond their own or anybody’s control, and changing habitualised behaviour is difficult. Additionally as we witness daily, life is inherently complex and reality may be elusive in the formulation of internal narratives and perceptions. In the telling of our own life stories, our memories are curiously malleable. What is lacking or dysfunctional may be readily apparent to an observer but insight cannot simply be delivered: it is best gained through a process of self-discovery requiring motivation and time.
Where there is an ongoing stressor with no likely beneficial outcome, ultimately the need for change has to be recognised and then actually acted upon by the patient, if action is possible. Motivational interviewing techniques may help to facilitate this, although these require practice and finesse. Psychological therapy can be incredibly helpful in guiding patients through a process of self-realisation, enabling them to identify key underlying issues and think about how they might be able to alter their circumstances or strengthen their coping mechanisms. It is likely to be most successful when appropriately individualised.
In some situations where a stressful event has been and gone, time will be the ultimate healer and reassurance enough (of course not in cases of PTSD). Exercise, nutrition, green spaces and mindfulness may well help with stress management and are always a good idea for general wellbeing, but may in many circumstances be unlikely to represent a cure for stress unless underlying issues are addressed. This is equally the case for alternative or complementary therapies. If a stressor is worth enduring for the likely resultant benefits, or circumstances are unalterable, then of course all of these approaches might be worth considering to make life more manageable, depending on context and preferences.
Receiving treatment may facilitate avoidance of confronting the emotional complexity and messiness of ‘normal life’.
It can be difficult to know whether an individual is likely to benefit from medication. For some it will, of course, be entirely appropriate and beneficial. Medication may appear an attractive fix to the ‘worried well’ and persuading them it is not necessarily the answer can prove challenging. My general assumption is that if there are not symptoms of an underlying depression or anxiety disorder, then antidepressants are unlikely to help (short of a placebo effect). If an individual does try an antidepressant and benefits from a placebo effect, they may lose faith in medical help when the effect inevitably dissipates.
Conversely, if the source of stress resolves and they feel better, they may attribute the improvement to the antidepressant and believe it is the answer in future. Many patients try various medications over time, and instead of finding a more satisfying job, or leaving their dismissive partner, they come back asking what they can try next. Receiving treatment may facilitate avoidance of confronting the emotional complexity and messiness of ‘normal life’. As stated by T.S. Eliot, ‘Human kind cannot bear very much reality’. Medication is turned to readily by doctors (even diazepam, which is surely comparable to prescribing alcohol), but this is somewhat understandable in view of the complexities described above, when we have ten (or fifteen) minutes and are likely to be somewhere on the stress spectrum ourselves.
Fit notes may be a helpful way to communicate with a patient’s place of employment, if work is a source of stress. However, surely in many circumstances the patient should first be encouraged to attempt a communication with their work in order to avoid fostering unnecessary dependence. Weighing up the risks and benefits of time off work can be difficult. It may offer a period of genuinely needed respite and reflection and time to action change. However, if nothing changes during the interim and the patient spends their time in an agony of worry about returning to a mountain of catch-up and all the same stresses, then it seems an unproductive strategy. We all know that prolonged periods off work can contribute to a deterioration in mental health: occupation or meaningful pursuit is a human need.
Some patients may live in a seemingly constant state of stress regardless of circumstances or treatment, for example due to personality traits related to complex background factors. This is not to cast judgement, but understanding that this is their norm may facilitate a more productive working relationship.
Should we have more training in the basics of life coaching or psychological therapy?
GPs are no longer paternalistic advisors and we have not trained as life coaches, counsellors or psychotherapists, but we may feel called into these roles by some patients. It leads me to wonder, what is our role here? Importantly of course we need to try to identify those who are ‘mentally ill’, those at risk of harm, or those who would benefit from medication. But beyond this? Sending everybody for psychological therapy seems like the best way to rapidly render the psychological therapy service unserviceable due to infeasible waiting times. Should we have more training in the basics of life coaching or psychological therapy? We are of course unlikely to achieve any level of mastery of these subjects, when they are themselves vast areas of professional expertise and we already have quite enough on our plates to deal with as medical generalists. Nor is a 10 minute GP consultation the right medium for these practices.
The self-help industry is booming, with an astonishing diversity of books, podcasts and apps available. Some of these represent high quality, valuable resources for the motivated. However, quality is hugely variable, many are not evidence-based and some can lead down dubious paths. Highly contradictory advice may be offered, and an individual may not know which area of self-care would be beneficial to explore without starting with a certain degree of insight. Should we be delving into this realm? But again, how can we become acquainted with and critically appraise this immense and constantly evolving bank of work, and condense the best contributions into an efficiently deliverable and individualised format?
Perhaps the elephant in the room is that rather than accessing some store of medical knowledge to support a stressed patient, I am falling back on my own common sense and personal experience and this does not feel legitimate: it can trigger my imposter syndrome and make me feel stressed.
An awareness that our ability to help is extremely limited can cause feelings of inadequacy and frustration, which can contribute to burn-out. Perhaps we should be embracing our limitations and admit that we do not currently have the answer to curing the underlying stressors of modern life. We must carefully avoid the transference of worry onto our own shoulders: we are truly not responsible for our patients’ difficulties or life choices, although we can offer concern. If nothing else in the intractable cases, what we can take pride in offering is a listening ear, compassion and validation, and through this the possibility of human connection.

Ten tips for telephone consultations about COVID-19
Posted by BJGP Life | 19 Mar 2020 | Coronavirus | 0
This guide is written by Roger Neighbour and Simon Stockley.
Dr Roger Neighbour (OBE MA DSc FRCP FRACGP FRCGP). He qualified in 1971 from King’s College, Cambridge, and St Thomas’ Hospital, London. He is the author of The Inner Consultation (1987), The Inner Apprentice (1992), and The Inner Physician (2016).
Dr. Simon Stockley is the RCGP Clinical Champion for Sepsis, and represents the RCGP on the NHS England Cross-systems Sepsis Prevention Programme Board and the Academy of Royal Colleges Sepsis Group. A GP for 30 years, he has prepared multiple sepsis teaching and support aids for clinicians working in general practice.
This guide is an aide-memoire for clinicians conducting telephone consultations to assess and advise patients concerned they may have coronavirus.
Pre-planning
1. Choose a good time for making the calls. Calls under these circumstances can be stressful. For everyone’s sake, try not to squeeze them in at a time during the day when you are already under more than usual pressure.
Consider using a checklist of questions or a template to guide and record your conversation.
Beginning the conversation
2. Establish early on who you are talking to and what the purpose of the call is.
Are you talking to the patient, or to a relative or carer? (If it’s not the patient, remember there may be issues of confidentiality.)
You could say something like:
“Let me see if I have got this right – you are worried that you may have coronavirus? … OK, in that case I’ll need ask you for a bit more information.”
Try not to let the call sound routine or a chore. Patients are more likely to accept reassurance or follow advice if the conversation feels ‘personal’.
Information needed
3. Check where the patient is at the moment. They may not be at the address you think they are, and this could be important if they need to be seen or are acutely unwell.
4. What are the symptoms? Are they consistent with coronavirus?
Does the patient have any pre-existing conditions such as COPD or asthma that could be causing the symptoms, or that could place the patient at increased risk of deterioration?
Do they have any facilities for taking temperature, measuring pulse, peak flow, blood sugar or other relevant physiology?
5. Actively ask about specific signs of deterioration.
Is the patient able to go about their normal activities? Have they stopped doing anything they usually do? Or are they well enough to do most of their usual daily activities?
When talking, does the patient sound breathless or unable to complete sentences without pausing for breath?
Take the concerns of parents or family seriously. They are in the best position to know if a child or loved one is behaving ‘uncharacteristically unwell’, i.e. not in the way they usually do when they’re ill.
Decide if telephone management is appropriate
6. Telephone management is appropriate if, and only if:
the diagnosis is fairly clear;
the duration of illness is short (Most patients should show some improvement over a 7-day period);
there are no ‘red flags’, and the patient seems in reasonable condition, and
the caller is willing to accept reassurance and advice.
Red flag warning signs include: • Difficulty in breathing / shortness of breath • Persistent pain or pressure in the chest • Pale and clammy • New confusion or becoming difficult to rouse • Blue lips or face. • Non-blanching rash
7. Give clear advice about staying at home
Government advice for people with possible or probable COVID-19, and their families and contacts, can change significantly at short notice. Before you make calls to patients, it is worth reading and/or printing-out the latest ‘stay at home’ guidance, which can be read and downloaded from:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-people-with-confirmed-or-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection°
You could also offer to send this link to the patient by text or email.
8. Check what other medications the patient is currently taking, in case any might need to be altered or suspended during a period of fever and possible dehydration e.g. metformin, ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, diuretics or steroids. Familiarise yourself with the Sick Day Rules, and offer to call the patient back later if you need to double-check your advice.
Safety netting
9. Always give clear safety netting advice, explaining what would be signs of getting worse, and what to do in that event. You could say something like:
‘Let me tell you what signs to look out for, that might indicate things were getting worse. If you start to:
become significantly breathless,
or develop pains in your chest,
or become pale and clammy ‘like someone who is about to vomit”,
or seem muddled or confused
‘then you should seek urgent medical advice.’
Finally, ask ‘Do you have any questions about what I’ve told you?’
Face-to-face consultations.
10. These should be used where there is diagnostic uncertainty either about the cause or the severity of the symptoms.
Make sure you know what the arrangements are for doing this in your practice or service, and how patients are to be segregated or isolated. If the patient needs to be seen face-to-face, tell them what to expect.

Delphi and the current path of Western culture
Posted by David Misselbrook | 7 Jun 2018 | International
I have just come back from the centre of the world. Not the centre of the earth of course. No, in ancient times the centre of the world was reckoned to be Delphi. This claim was evidence based. If we do not articulate our values and construct a world where freedom, tolerance, fairness and human dignity win the day then the west has no moral high ground from which to lecture the rest of the world. The west has rested on its smug moral superiority for far too long.

Gulf culture, social eating and health
Posted by David Misselbrook | 5 Mar 2018 | International
Bahrain has sometimes been called a string of shopping malls calling itself a country. This is quite a blinkered view. Bahrain is in fact a string of shopping malls and restaurants calling itself a country. Does it matter if we don’t eat together anymore? There are various markers to suggest that it does, particularly for children. The OECD state that students who do not regularly eat with their parents are significantly more likely to truant from school, and this correlates with school performance. And according to the 2014 European Congress on Obesity, children who do not eat dinner with their parents at least twice a week were 40 percent more likely to be overweight.

Writing for the BJGP – Beyond Research
Posted by Euan Lawson | 4 Jun 2018 | BJGP News | 0
Euan Lawson is the Deputy Editor of the BJGP.
One of the aspects of the BJGP that has always been appreciated by readers is that we publish a lot of writing about primary care and the profession that goes beyond research.
In the BJGP we have editorials and we have more traditional medical education articles such as those featured in Clinical Intelligence. We have Debate & Analysis pieces but we also accept more personal writing that covers the experience of primary care.
We also publish articles on everything beyond the consulting room and we have always reached into areas such as book and film reviews, arts, theatre and exhibitions. And, of course, we do opinion and polemic. They are all welcome. Nowadays, they are found in the Life & Times section of the BJGP but we have other options as well now.
We’ve summarised these so that if you have a hankering to write for us you will have a better idea of where to focus your efforts.
Print BJGP – Life & Times: www.bjgp.org
The Life & Times section of the print journal is familiar to many people. It has, in the past, been known simply as the Back Pages and it has been through a period as Out of Hours. All articles in the print journal, including Life & Times (L&T), will be indexed on Pubmed but articles for L&T are not generally peer-reviewed in the same way as research articles and editorials.
In order to meet the requirements to fit on a page we generally need articles for L&T to be 600-700 words long. There is some flexibility but we like to use images in the print journal and we need some space in which to add them.
We like book reviews to be 300-350 words when possible although some reviews will be 600-700 words long. We do publish longer essays on occasions. Typically, lengths of 1200-1400 words will then fit. It’s worth mentioning that our preference is to stick to single-page articles in the majority of cases.
If you are aware of a local exhibition or event that could be of interest then get in touch. We may be able to use a review.
We are fortunate enough to receive more submissions than we can publish in the print journal. We are always happy to consider any article but if you do stray far beyond these limits it does make it harder for us to use it.
BJGP Life: www.bjgplife.com
We also have a blog and website where we publish articles that are better suited to an online medium. Sometimes that is because they are time sensitive and topical. The print journal, the main BJGP, is a monthly publication and that does result in a modest lag to publication. Even if we had absolutely no articles in the pipeline and we pushed a piece into the next available issue it could be several weeks before it is printed and distributed. More commonly we are working 2-3 issues down the line for articles that are not time-sensitive.
BJGP Life gives us the opportunity to publish articles that are of immediate interest to our readers. In addition, there is an open-ended option with word count. We’ve had some excellent ‘Long Reads’ – check out Stanley Jeff’s piece as a good example. That said, in our experience many longer pieces are often much better as shorter articles. It’s the old case of Pascal’s Apology: “I’m sorry that this was such a long letter, but I didn’t have time to write you a short one”.
A good length for an article on BJGP Life is much the same as the print journal – 600-900 words works well. Importantly, BJGP Life also gives us the chance to publish multiple images, videos, audio and use media more creatively. We simply can’t do that with the print journal. Articles on BJGP Life will not be indexed on Pubmed. That said, we may well be able to publish a short version in the print BJGP and a longer version, perhaps with multi-media, on BJGP Life. We are very happy to consider this as an option when suitable.
Regular bloggers
We do have a number of people who write regularly. We’d be delighted to hear from anyone else who is interested in getting involved. Get in touch and let us know.
BJGP Open: www.bjgpopen.org
The BJGP has now launched BJGP Open. BJGP Open is an international, peer reviewed, open access, online-only journal of primary care, which publishes original research and other articles of importance to primary care clinicians, researchers and teachers worldwide. BJGP Open publishes research articles and full details for authors considering submitting research can be found here. BJGP Open will also publish Practice & Policy articles with a much reduced article processing charge. These should be 800-1000 words long and can cover a range of areas.
Practice & Policy articles could include case reports and we are very interested in international reports that describe interesting and important clinical, health policy, and medico-political developments and initiatives, designed to highlight aspects of primary health care around the globe and to generate discussion and debate.
Submitting articles
The best way to submit articles for the BJGP including L&T and BJGP Open is via the online submission system on the individual websites.
You will be able to ignore many of the boxes as they are only applicable to full research papers but it does ensure we have the important details and appropriate COIs etc recorded.
If you are interested in writing for the BJGP Life website then drop us an email via the feedback form or contact journal@rcgp.org.uk.

The Future of Medicine
Posted by Roger Jones | 11 Mar 2020 | Opinion | 0
Professor Roger Jones is the Editor of the British Journal of General Practice.
The Changing Face of Medicine project is gathering momentum.
As President of the BMA, Professor Pali Hungin launched a project to look into the impact of fast moving technological advances, the shifting role of the doctor, the adequacy of medical education, the nature of public and patient expectations of clinicians, the need for visionary medical leadership, and the well-being of clinicians themselves. This is the Changing Face of Medicine (CFOM) project, which held a conference at the Kings Fund, under the auspices of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, on 27th February 2020. Professor Hungin hoped that the meeting would open the way to a formal, long-term process, embracing social, clinical and technological contributors. By the end of a fascinating day, it was clear that this is a conversation that is urgently required now and will be needed for some time in the future.
Part of the impetus for this process was, of course, the recruitment, retention and morale crisis facing medicine. Acknowledging that parameters such as the ideal numbers of medical students and doctors required are uncertain, Professor Michael Farthing, chair of the CFOM faculty group and formerly Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sussex, considered the effects of new roles and new technologies on the need for continuing “medical” input, recognising that the evidence at present suggests that these additional resources may have more to do with enhancing the quality of care than substituting for clinicians. He reminded us that UK levels of medical staffing are well below the EU average. Developing this theme, Professor Hungin reflected on the gradual falling-off in numbers of medical graduates proceeding to specialist training. He was pessimistic about the future of continuity of care, despite the evidence of its value. He emphasised the central importance of patients and their expectations and highlighted Donald Irvine’s concept of “active patient autonomy“. He wondered if there might even be dangers to doctors’ own well-being in clinging to core values such as empathy and compassion, although he acknowledged that human contact would always trump technology.
Professor Derek Alderson, President of the Royal College of Surgeons, gave an exhilarating overview of the implications of technological and other medical advances on surgery and healthcare, casting his net widely to include imaging, robotics, robot assisted surgery, 3-D bioprinting of tissues and organs, and neural prostheses. New surgical and clinical skills will have to be developed in the context of a focus on patient safety, surgical education and leadership and, perhaps most important of all, the development of a robust evidence base to support surgical innovations. He saw the current National Trainee Research Collaboratives as having a critical role in encouraging clinical studies and successful research collaborations in the future, and went onto show how surgery had a global importance in terms of improving health outcomes, citing surgical treatment of club foot and fistula as life-changing interventions.
Professor Sheona MacLeod, Deputy Director or Medical Education reform at Health Education England, looked at what was in the medical education pipeline that might support rapid professional and technological change. The Medical Educational Reform Program emphasises increased mobility in training, better educational support and supervision, and greater alignment with geographical needs. Scenario planning, looking at different possible future is for medicine and society, has been used to explore ways in which medical education curricula can be “flexed“ to take account of changing patterns of care. Future challenges included multimorbidity, the increasing complexities of care, workforce demands, the need for lifelong learning, the need to respond to geographical variation, with workforce planning based on local morbidities, and deploying different staff with different competencies to work in different locations. Dr Charlie Bell, the National Medical Director’s clinical fellow, picked up some of these themes, thinking about how medical education before and after medical school needs to develop, challenging the need to necessarily recruit the most “academic“ students, and also challenging us to think about exactly what we are training medical students for, while emphasising the importance of sustainability, social justice and ethics in any curriculum..
Patients have less access to their medical records than they do to their car maintenance log.
In a very affecting presentation Jocelyn Cornwell, a medical sociologist and anthropologist, and founder of the Point of Care Foundation, considered the hazards of crystal ball gazing, citing the current downturn in life expectancy, and the rapid rise in mental health problems among young people as two unexpected and unpredictable events. She urged a focus on human relationships which she feared might be moving towards the periphery of medicine, rather than being at its centre, identifying the key drivers of patient satisfaction as trust, responsiveness and teamwork. Trust, she thought, was being eroded. Patients have less access to their medical records than they do to their car maintenance log. Doctor to doctor clinic letters which are not copied to patients represent a ‘straightforwardly infantilising behaviour’: as recently as two years ago the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges felt it necessary to issue guidance to say that it was good practice to write outpatient letters to patients. Why isn’t there a campaign for a fully patient-held medical record? Although the gravitational pull of the concept of shared decision-making is great, embraced by policymakers and regarded as perhaps ending medical paternalism, it contains within it the potential for coercion, raising issues of self-efficacy and sometimes resulting in a ‘paternalistic failure to share expert knowledge’. She was concerned about the lack of support for the well-being of NHS staff, which needs to be much more visible and more available – staff can’t care for patients if nobody cares for them. The NHS is a dilapidated and unsuitable environment, with antiquated IT, many workarounds, poor continuity, and often casual management. There is a lot to do!
Every patient wants to be treated as a person not a case, with an emphasis on transparency and trust.
Patricia Wilkie, President of the National Association for Patient Participation set out her manifesto for 2040. Every patient wants to be treated as a person not a case, with an emphasis on transparency and trust. They should have direct access to their medical records and perhaps direct access to test ordering and communication of results. Letters should always be addressed to the patient and copied to the general practitioner. By 2040 public and patients will have learnt to work with other healthcare professionals, be aware of the costs to the NHS of their treatment, and will work in partnership with doctors to encourage self-management. They will still want to discuss sensitive and embarrassing issues with a doctor they know and trust and will want access to an expert generalist to make diagnostic and management decisions. The therapeutic power of the face-to-face relationship cannot be overestimated. GPs and pharmacists should work together with patients on polypharmacy, and by 2040 doctors and patients must be working together to hold management to account. GPs will need to strike a new deal with patients, recognising their mutual responsibilities.
Sir Mark Caulfield, Chief Scientist for Genomics, opened his Pandora’s Box of genomics, revealing the glittering prizes that we might anticipate in the years ahead. The 100,000 Genomes Project, the Accelerating Detection of Disease programme and UK BioBank offer a heady mixture of genetic technologies. Rapid automated analytic methods have enabled very fast genomic analysis capable of identifying abnormalities in a number of rare diseases, which were previously almost impossible to diagnose and treat. A huge amount of energetic research activity is taking place around cystic fibrosis, Gaucher’s and Fabry syndromes, Huntington’s disease, haemophilia, and mRNA diseases, as well, of course, as cancer. This new investigative and therapeutic landscape will inevitably have major implications for the training and clinical roles of doctors, as well as the ways in which they interact with non-clinicians and patients, although the nature of these changes is not yet clear.
England’s Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty offered an extremely elegant vision of the future of medicine and the medical profession, using some very cleverly-chosen data such as changing fertility rates and population “replacement rates“ across Europe, and their implications for changes in future population demographics and consequent health needs. He looked at changes in the balance between urbanicity and rurality and the resulting changes in the location of patients with multimorbidity. There will be a steady increase in the concentration of multimorbidity in people at the oldest end of the age spectrum, along with changing patterns of multimorbidity involving cancer, cardiovascular disease and dementia, clustering of co-morbidities, and changes in disease geography. These all have implications for the distribution and skill mix required of the medical workforce. He pointed out that although there have been major improvements in survival rates for many cancers, other health indicators in the UK are not so good: we are not in the top tier of OECD countries for neonatal health for example. Increasing multimorbidity means that the proportion of life lived in poor health will inevitably increase and this will dominate medical demand and activity in the years ahead.
Doctors’ skills lie in diagnostic decision making, but complex therapeutics might be better handled by other professionals.
Looking to the future we will need to tackle multi morbidity more seriously, look much harder at case-mix and changes in the geographical distribution of disease, encourage different working patterns to respond to these, and become more serious about understanding and modifying demand. The roles of different healthcare professionals will also need to be re-defined; one example might be the separation of diagnosis from therapeutics. Doctors’ skills lie in diagnostic decision making, but complex therapeutics might be better handled by other professionals. We will need to train people closer to where we need them to work and understand much better the reasons for doctors choosing to go into certain specialties and not others. Careers will need to be more flexible so that doctors are able to do different things at different times.
These main presentations, all of which provided a great deal of food for thought, were interspersed by some really fascinating shorter sessions. Richard Stevens and Joseph Butler staged a witty and penetrating sketch on the impact of new communication technologies on doctor: patient communication within the consultation. Sunny Raju, Lily Lamb and colleagues’ debate on visionary leadership was a powerful reminder of the resources that the next generation of clinicians will bring to medicine in the future.
This important dialogue needs to continue, and this absorbing day suggested that it will do so with a spirit of optimism. Perhaps what came across most strongly was the enduring importance of the human dimensions of medical care, the need for personal contact, the desire for trust, the hope for continuity and the value placed on genuinely personal care. These are the values which, no matter how seductive the new technologies appear, must remain at the centre of the professional and moral compass of medicine.

The Twitter GP Journal Club relaunch #gpjc
Posted by BJGP Life | 1 Aug 2018 | GP Journal Club | 0
In 2011, a Cambridge medical student and a foundation programme doctor working in the West Midlands founded the first ever Twitter journal club (@twitjournalclub/#twitjc). Within weeks they had close to a thousand followers. There are now 59 journal club Twitter hashtags, although not all of these are active, including @twitjournalclub which became inactive in December 2013.
@GPJournalClub (#gpjc) was founded in December 2015 by Lucy Pocock (@drpoco), who was at the time a GP registrar on maternity leave. The account had 100 followers within 24 hours and now has over a thousand. The first tweet chat took place on 10th January 2016 and had 25 participants. Monthly tweet chats then followed, supported by the BJGP Blog, until March 2017. Juggling being a new GP, and relatively new mum, Lucy found that she had little time to devote to running the journal club and it became increasingly difficult to recruit willing volunteers to co-chair the tweet chats.
On Sunday 9th September 2018 at 7.30pm, @GPJournalClub will relaunch with Dr Shibley Rahman (@dr_shibley) in the hot seat, selecting a paper and co-chairing the discussion.
In order to create a more sustainable future for @GPJournalClub Lucy, now a School for Primary Care Research GP Career Progression Fellow, is looking for volunteers to be part of a management group. This is a role that would particularly suit academic GP trainees and would look great on a CV!
If you are interested, please contact her on Twitter (@drpoco) or via email (lucy.pocock@bristol.ac.uk).

Palliative care in its broadest sense: Indian style
Posted by BJGP Life | 17 Oct 2019 | International, Opinion | 0
Philippa Jeacocke is an ST3 GP trainee in Sheffield. She has just returned from a year out of training, during which she worked in a variety of settings exploring her interests in refugee heath and palliative care.
Nandika has a huge, beaming smile. She smiles often and easily, and you find yourself smiling back in return. Before she was known to Pallium she lived in a makeshift tarpaulin shelter with her 13 year old son Harshad, sleeping on a mat on the ground and relying on the kindness of neighbours to bring them food. There was zero financial support; Nandika’s husband had left her several years ago because of her illness. Nandika relied on Harshad to draw up and inject her insulin because she was almost blind in both eyes due to cataracts, and the lack of any refrigeration meant the insulin sometimes overheated and degraded. When I first met her she had been without insulin for three days for this reason. Her walking is limited due to severe Charcot’s arthropathy and a deep ulcer on the base of her foot that has been chronically infected for the last four years, needing intermittent hospital admissions for intravenous antibiotics.
Nandika has type 1 diabetes and is 42 years old. She lives in Kerala in India, the country with the inauspicious title of having the most people with diabetes in any country in the world. It is also a country that has some of the world’s most prestigious international diabetes institutes, and yet situations like that of Nandika’s are not uncommon.
They champion a broad concept of palliative care, in many ways broader than that which we are familiar with in the West.
Pallium (https://palliumindia.org/) is a non-governmental organisation based in Trivandrum, Kerala and was founded by Dr Rajagopal, an anaesthetist by training. Its mandate is to provide and advocate for quality palliative care in Kerala and throughout India. They champion a broad concept of palliative care, in many ways broader than that which we are familiar with in the West, focussing on the relief of serious health-related suffering. This is in line with the recent international consensus definition which called on the WHO to update their own definition, to better encompass the needs of patients with complex chronic diseases, and crucially, to better reflect the challenges faced by low and middle-income countries where health professionals are often working without adequate resources or training1.
Trivandrum Institute of Palliative Science – the HQ of Pallium
In India, serious health-related suffering is tragically frequent, often as a result of severely limited access to opioid analgesia but also commonly due to complications that could have been prevented with earlier medical input or more consistent follow up. With these patients, as Dr Rajagopal explains, “the existing health system is not able to cater to their suffering” and as such, Pallium steps in. As a result, their patient population is diverse, including patients with advanced cancers, strokes and frailty, as well as those like Nandika, with complications of diabetes and vascular disease, and significant numbers with paraplegia or tetraplegia sustained following road traffic accidents or falls during coconut and banana tree harvesting.
A doctor in a primary health care centre catering to around 20-30,000 people will see between 100-300 patients a day.
Nandika’s story is a poignant illustrator of the many social and cultural barriers to accessing healthcare in India, in particular the often unaffordable out-of-pocket financial costs, and the social stigma experienced by people with illness and disability. A house, a fridge, and an income would likely have led to very different health outcomes for her and her son. It also highlights the importance of access to quality primary care to prevent complications of chronic disease, to help tackle socio-cultural barriers, and ultimately to reduce health inequalities. Kerala are doing better than other Indian states, but even so, a doctor in a primary health care centre catering to around 20-30,000 people will see between 100-300 patients a day. It is difficult, if not impossible, to imagine being able to provide quality care in such a setting.
In August I returned from my out of programme year to ST3 training in Sheffield. I now work within a skilful multidisciplinary team where health care assistants conduct pre-diabetes counselling, clinical pharmacists perform diabetic annual reviews and specialist foot care teams are just a phone call away. Despite our own pressing primary care crisis, my recent experience of healthcare in Kerala stands in stark contrast to provision in this country, and further accentuates the multiple systemic challenges that Pallium are battling on a daily basis.
Thanks to the dedicated work of Pallium, Nandika now has her own apartment with a fridge. Her vision has been dramatically improved following bilateral cataract surgeries, and a pair of glasses, which means she can administer her own insulin and Harshad can now attend school, significantly increasing his own life opportunities. Her glycaemic control is improving and she has ongoing foot and wound care with the input of a diabetic foot specialist.
These positive steps are a testament to the truly holistic palliative care provided by the team at Pallium, and I feel very privileged to have had the opportunity to work alongside colleagues who showed such compassionate commitment to their patients.

GP Journal Club: the primary care–secondary care battleground
Posted by BJGP Life | 22 Apr 2016 | GP Journal Club | 0
Sampson R, Barbour R and Wilson P. The relationship between GPs and hospital consultants and the implications for patient care: a qualitative study. BMC Fam Pract 2016. 17:(1): 1-12
The next GP Journal Club is on the 8th May at 8pm. You can download the paper here.
Rammya Mathew is an academic GP at UCL and is chairing the next GP Journal Club.
Sampson et al have done a fantastic job of characterising the somewhat strained relationships that exist across the primary care-secondary care interface. On reading the paper, I couldn’t help but feel that so much of the narrative rings true of my own experiences on the frontline. I am well aware of the difficulties we face in primary care and how it can sometimes feel as though we are on the battlefield with our hospital colleagues. However, we often fail to realise that they have their own frustrations regarding our working practices, and whilst we are botch seeing the situation from our own perspectives, it is indeed the patient who becomes the victim of unintended combat.
I find it incomprehensible that we are supposedly working together for our patients, but at the same time, we struggle to pick up the phone and talk to each other. There have been times when I have patiently listened to an automated switchboard message for a whole three and a half minutes in the middle of a busy morning surgery, only to then be greeted by the glaring beep of an ominous dead tone. But what if our hospital colleagues want to speak to us – between jam-packed surgeries that are sandwiched with home visits, when do we make ourselves available to them? With an ever increasing workload, it sometimes seems unimaginable that we might be able to create the time and/or space required to enable meaningful dialogue between primary and secondary care.
In my experience, working together breeds a great sense of satisfaction but there are certain do’s and don’t, which have to be respected. I’m sure that on both sides of the fence, we are cautious of not allowing our egos to get in the way of good patient care. But when does integrated working and shared care overstep the mark and quite frankly become ‘dumping’? Recently, there has been a growing sense of frustration in primary care at the ‘GP to chase’ rhetoric, which plagues hospital discharge summaries and outpatient clinic letters. This prompted the following response on Twitter:
‘Hospital docs please, respectfully etc, note difference between GP and labrador’.
It feels like one-way traffic in general practice, but the truth is that our hospital colleagues feel equally dumped on by us. I can certainly hold my hands up and say that there have been times when I have been unable to handle the uncertainty and I have fired off a half-hearted referral, just to ease the pressure and share the load. I wouldn’t for a second blame the doctor at the receiving end for bemoaning my actions. The sad reality is that despite all the gatekeeping we do in general practice, we sometimes get it wrong and make ‘inappropriate’ referrals; when hospital wards and clinics are bursting at the seams, its unsurprising that this is greeted with great dissatisfaction. It seems as though, whilst we are sinking, we get unhelpfully defensive and look to point the finger at each another. It sometimes feels as though we purposely close our eyes to each others’ plight, just as a means of survival.
So how do we join forces on the battleground? It may sound simplistic but perhaps we need to spend more time in each others kingdoms. At the very least it would engrain reasonable expectations of what the other can do. As GPs we gain invaluable experience of hospital medicine during our training years. On the other hand, there are specialists who have never set foot in general practice, beyond undergraduate level training. This leads to misunderstandings about workload and archaic views of what GPs do. As professionals, we stand to gain a lot by coming together. Namely, respect and understanding. But if we truly succeed in breaking down institutional divides, it will be our patients who reap the benefits of holistic interdisciplinary care.
Collaborative working is of growing importance in the face of an ageing population and rising multi-morbidity, but the way in which we practice now just doesn’t allow for it. In recent years our focus in primary care has been on improving access, but some speculate as to whether this has just perpetuated spiralling demand. Every day, minor ailments walk through my door that would have resolved without any input from a GP. I sometimes feel as though we are seeing more and more patients at the expense of providing holistic and coordinated care for those who most need it. It is clear that we need to to invest in the primary care-secondary care interface for the sake of these patients, but what can we safely stop doing in order to make this happen?
Join us for the @GPJournalclub discussion at 8pm on the 8th May to discuss this paper and to explore the primary care–secondary care interface in more depth.
Feel free to leave suggestions for questions on the night – tweet me @RammyaMathew, or leave a reply in the comments box.

A BJGP Christmas Carol: Part One
Posted by BJGP Life | 17 Dec 2018 | Stories | 0
Peter Aird is a GP in Bridgwater, Somerset.
This is part one of a five part series. If you can’t wait and like to binge read then you can download the full five part version for free as an epub or mobi file for use with your Kindle or other e-reader.
Stave One – in which Scrooge reveals how burnt out he is
Old Dr Marley was dead. As dead as the NHS would be within a couple of years if things didn’t start to improve soon. And, as far as Dr Ebenezer Scrooge was concerned, Jacob Marley was better off out of it. Scrooge and Marley had been long term partners and Scrooge greatly missed his former colleague who had died several years earlier. This was not the result of any affection he had had for the man, that was not in Scrooge’s nature, but rather on account of the fact that, due to the national shortage of GPs, he had been unable to find a replacement, and his workload had consequently increased beyond the point of being manageable.
It was Christmas Eve and Scrooge was sat at the desk in his consulting room. It was nearly three in the afternoon. Morning surgery had only just finished and this was now what was laughably called his ‘lunch break’. An email flashed up on his computer screen. It was from the CCG wishing him a merry Christmas.
‘Bah!’ muttered Scrooge to himself. ‘Humbug! If they really wanted my Christmas to be merry, then perhaps they and NHS England could have agreed that I didn’t have to make up the
Advanced Access hours, lost from not opening the surgery on Christmas Day, later in the week. Every idiot,’ he continued, ‘who goes about with “Merry Christmas” on his lips should be submitted to unnecessary colonoscopic examination and be forced to reflect on the experience for the purposes of revalidation.’
Dr Scrooge was not one to enjoy Christmas, and being encouraged to be merry served only to darken his already black mood still further. The situation was not helped by the arrival of a receptionist who announced her presence with a knock on his already open door.
‘Sorry to trouble you Dr Scrooge, but the Salvation Army band are playing Christmas carols in the car park and are asking if you would like to make a donation.’ She handed him a leaflet informing him that this Christmas many people would not have anywhere to sleep due to the lack of hospital beds resulting from years of chronic NHS underfunding. Scrooge sighed – this was nothing he didn’t already know. Only that morning he had been asked to arrange a review over the holiday period of a patient that was about to be discharged, a little earlier than was ideal, from the local, desperately overworked, hospital. Though he regretted being unable to promise that level of care, his refusal then had been unequivocal and he was no more minded now, at his own personal expense, to start financially propping up a system left destitute by the establishment.
As far as he was concerned, he was already paying quite enough tax and, given that he had just learnt that the security of his pension was now somewhat precarious, he felt it was unlikely that he would change his mind on the matter. He stood up and slammed the door in his informant’s face. Sensibly, the receptionist interpreted that as a ‘No’ and scuttled back to where her colleagues were celebrating Christmas with a box of mince pies and a tube of Prosecco and pink peppercorn Pringles – the latter, notwithstanding the alliteration, surely an ill-advised flavour choice, regardless of the season.
Scrooge had been invited to share in the festivities but he had no desire to do so. Nor did he have time. Instead he returned to his computer screen and started the never-ending task of clearing his inbox of lab results, hospital letters, and prescription requests. He’d barely started when there was another knock at the door. Scrooge barked out a ‘What is it?’ and the door swung open to reveal the ST3 who had been with the practice since August. Dr Robert Cratchit was a highly capable doctor though one who lacked confidence in his own ability. To Scrooge’s dismay he was wearing a Christmas jumper.
‘What do you want? Can’t you see I’m busy?
These words were not unfamiliar to Dr Cratchit, who, over the previous five months, had heard them frequently from the man who purported to be his trainer. In fact, so frequently had he heard them that, for a time, he had used them to start all consultations with patients, imagining them to be the profession’s approved opening words for all doctor-patient interactions. A failed attempt at the CSA and the associated considerable expense of applying to sit the exam again had indeed taught him much.
Familiarity, however, did not make it any easier for Dr Cratchit to approach a man who never offered advice without showing contempt for the one who asked for it. For although Scrooge had received training on giving feedback, he had, much to the dismay of his appraiser, consistently failed to demonstrate any change in his behaviour as a result of such practice improving activity.
‘I was j-just wondering if it would be convenient if I were to g-go,’ Cratchit stammered. ‘I’m only supposed to do one clinical session today and, though the planned patch t-tutorial for this afternoon has been cancelled, I thought that, since you allocated me all the visits, you m-might let me skip off a little early this afternoon. It is Christmas after all and I would so appreciate having the extra time to be with m-my family.’
Scrooge glowered. ‘Of course it’s not convenient. And I don’t suppose you’ll be offering to work a couple of extra Saturday mornings in lieu of the day you’ll no doubt be taking off tomorrow. That’s the trouble with young doctors these days. No commitment.’
The ST3 smiled faintly and waited nervously.
‘Go on then, leave,’ Scrooge eventually conceded, ‘But if anything goes amiss this afternoon and I’m compelled to reflect on some significant event or another, I know where my reflections will lay the blame. Just make sure you’re in early on Thursday.’
Cratchit thanked Scrooge and slipped away, leaving the burnt out old clinician alone with his thoughts and the prospect of a three hour afternoon surgery.
As things turned out the rest of the day was mercifully quiet with Christmas Eve being the one afternoon of the year which provided the general population with something more interesting to do than seek medical advice regarding their minor health concerns. As a result, Scrooge locked up the practice early and arrived home before nine. He’d stopped on the way to pick up a bite to eat but, having consumed it en route, the only thing he had to look forward to on arriving back was, as most evenings, the prospect of going to bed.
As he got out of his car, a fog hung about the driveway of the old house that he’d bought some years before. Scrooge approached the front door, the fog seeming to cling to him as he walked. It was then that he noticed, in place of the ancient door knocker, what was clearly the face of his old partner, Dr Marley. The apparition lasted but a moment before Scrooge, unsettled by the sighting, hurried on, unlocking the door and subsequently forcing a pile of unsolicited medical periodicals to one side as he entered the house. He locked the door behind him and climbed the stairs to his bedroom.
Scrooge undressed and put on his night attire. As he sat gazing into the middle distance, contemplating once more the strange appearance of the door knocker, there came an unexpected ringing sound that filled him with inexplicable dread. Scrooge scrambled in his pocket for his phone. However, as the caller’s number was withheld, he, as was his custom, ignored what was almost certainly a nuisance call and continued his preparations for bed.
And then he saw it.
A sight that caused him to be more horrified than he’d ever been before – even more horrified than that morning when his appointments had included seven heart sink patients and three more complaining of being ‘tired all the time’. Before him, as unwelcome as critical emails from the head of Medicines Management, stood the ghost of Dr Jacob Marley.
Scrooge, nothing if not a man of reason, rose up and spoke to the spectre in an accusatory tone.
‘I don’t believe in you,’ he said.
‘You don’t believe in most NICE guidelines and yet they exist,’ countered the phantom.
‘That’s true,’ Scrooge was forced to concede and with that he sat back down in his chair. He paused a moment then, looking the ghost full in the face and acknowledging his existence, asked the reason for his visit.
‘I have come to warn you Ebenezer. There is yet a chance that you may escape what has become my fate. I am condemned to walk the earth for all eternity burdened by these chains – chains composed of nonsensical bureaucratic demands imposed on me by those who understand nothing of medicine and seek to use the profession for their own political ends. You have forgotten, Ebenezer, what being a doctor is really all about. You have forgotten the joy that your work once brought you and now you practise as a mere shadow of the clinician you once longed to be. You’re burnt out Ebenezer. Something needs to change.’
‘Blimey!’ said Scrooge, ‘like that’s going to happen.’
‘You will be haunted by three spirits,’ continued the ghost, ignoring Scrooge’s cynicism. ‘They will teach you all that you need to know. Without them you cannot hope to shun the path I now tread. Expect the first when the clock strikes one.’
And with that the ghost of Jacob Marley departed, groaning incoherent sounds of lamentation and dragging the weight of his chains behind him. Scrooge stood motionless for he knew not how long. Then, mindful of his need for rest, he climbed into bed. Picking up a copy of the BJGP, he fell asleep upon an instant.

My first year as a GP physician associate
Posted by BJGP Life | 26 Feb 2020 | Opinion | 0
Aimee Ehrenzeller is a physician associate working in general practice in South Wales. Her interests include women’s health, paediatrics and teaching.
When I first qualified as a physician associate (PA), I had no intention to work in general practice, at least until later in my career. I was unsure of the impact a PA could have in a GP setting prior to the much anticipated statutory regulation and associated prescribing rights. As a student, I was fortunate enough to undertake primary care placements where I met many GPs who were enthusiastic about the role of PAs. I took up a fixed-term 6 month post with one of these GPs upon qualifying and, over one year on, I have no intention of going elsewhere!
My typical day consists of on-the-day appointments, telephone consultations, routine appointments and clinical admin, including audit work and actioning blood results and hospital letters. On Wednesday afternoons, I run the baby clinic where I carry out six week medical checks and I have also completed extra training in coil fitting.
Prescribing
I had anticipated that the lack of prescribing rights for PAs while awaiting statutory regulation would be the biggest issue faced in primary care. After several months of building a trusting relationship with my GP supervisor, who is aware of my competencies and the areas in which I may need advice, prescribing issues rarely arise. My appointment slots are 15 minutes long, which allows for a standard consultation plus extra time to get a prescription signed and discuss the case if needed. My supervising GP will often be doing admin or telephone triage nearby, so patients are rarely kept waiting.
Patient views
Patients generally like the accessibility of my appointments, which are largely available on the day.
Patients are becoming more accepting of a multidisciplinary approach to healthcare. They are familiar with the roles of my colleagues including our practice specialist mental health practitioner, clinical pharmacists, extended role occupational therapy practitioner, nurse practitioners and first contact physiotherapy practitioners. I always begin my consultations by explaining who I am and what my role means, to ensure that patients do not falsely think they are being seen by a GP.
Patients generally like the accessibility of my appointments, which are largely available on the day, and recognise that my current non-prescribing status does not mean that they will leave without the appropriate treatment. My patients trust my clinical judgment and are always happy for me to consult with a GP if I need to.
Views of the team
Understandably, as with any new role, some colleagues have had reservations about working alongside a physician associate. One year in, I have been accepted by my team and my scope of practice is very well understood by the clinical and admin staff. As somebody who takes an active role in quality improvement and service redesign, my colleagues often come to me with questions about new protocols or guidelines. We have a flat team approach to working and recognise that our range of backgrounds and training is our strongest strength. Similarly, my colleagues are always more than happy to help me with areas that I am less confident with.
Impact on practice
Having a physician associate within the practice has meant greater accessibility to appointments, less pressure on the on-call doctor, improved prescribing rates in certain areas, a permanent member of staff who can act as a point of contact for locum GPs and teaching and shadowing opportunities for nurses and pharmacists undertaking advanced practice studies. With statutory regulation in the pipeline, the future is looking bright for PAs in primary care!

Elinor Gunning is an academic GP and UCL Clinical Teaching Fellow (@EJGun)
“So, in the future, can we just replace GPs with a diagnostic robot?”
Is it just me, or do other GPs hear this question a lot? Often it’s more commonly phrased ‘who needs a GP when you’ve got Google’, but the replacement of doctors with computer programs seems to be a recurring theme when discussing the technological future of medicine.
[bctt tweet=”BJGP Blog: Who needs a GP when you’ve got Google?”]
Most recently I heard this question posed during a Q&A session for ‘The Day Before Tomorrow’, a documentary exploring the impact of technological developments on health care. Part of the documentary addresses what is referred to as ‘quantified self’, a new movement which proposes that self-tracking our personal health data can improve our health. As a society we are suddenly generating an awful lot of health related data – industries have realised that consumers enjoy self- monitoring, and this has led to an explosion of devices and apps which record information such as heart rate, activity, weight and even mood. Perhaps these devices will become so advanced, it was argued, that one day they would interpret the data and diagnose us too – so who needs primary care?
This economic convergence of healthcare and technology is certainly generating a lot of money, but is it just a fad or can it benefit patients? As I sat in the audience, surrounded by representatives of private healthcare providers with dollar signs in their eyes, I wondered whether simply measuring these indicators can actually make us healthier? Where is the evidence that if I record my mood, activity and heart rate I will become happier, fitter and live longer? If an app told me each day that I wasn’t walking far enough, would this ultimately motivate me to change, or would I just turn my phone off? Can novel digital feedback ever be as effective as a consultation with a doctor who can ask me why I am less active and perhaps discover that I am depressed?
I have no doubt that with more research this vast amount of monitoring data will lead to improved diagnostics, chronic disease management and preventative medicine. But medicine needs the ‘art’ as well as the ‘science’, and that means human involvement. Robots may be cheaper, but we need doctors too, doctors who can empathise with our lives, listen to our worries, and, most crucially, don’t have an off-switch when they tell us what we want to ignore.

“doctors who can empathise with our lives, listen to our worries, and, most crucially, don’t have an off-switch when they tell us what we want to ignore.” A bit like Dr John Sassall!

Yes, very much so. They hang together quite well these two posts – certainly some convergence but I’m not sure just how much capacity the future NHS (or current perhaps) has to embrace empathy as an outcome. Though, it is perhaps what most patients would really want.

BJGP Long Read: A valedictory note on my retirement
Posted by BJGP Life | 21 Feb 2020 | BJGP Long Read | 18
Claire Stillman is a recently retired GP who spent 30 years in Scottish general practice, the last 20 of which were in Glasgow.
About eight months ago I wrote an emotional, angry rant about why I was leaving general practice. It was in response to a questionnaire from the LMC asking me for reasons why I was going. I never sent it to them; it seemed enough to write everything down and it exhausted my anger. I kept meaning to go back to it but I never did, probably because it was too upsetting when I was in work and then it became irrelevant when I left. My emotion had been expended. Also, I felt that I had said nothing new. There were no blinding insights, other people had said the same things over and over and nothing had changed. It is hard to see how anything can change given the current structure and funding of the NHS. I should say that I took early retirement at the age of 59 following 30 years in General Practice and I might have taken a handful of days of sick leave in that time. I never took any time off for stress.
Here are the reasons I left, or perhaps some of them:
Appointments
The appointment system is not fit for purpose. A GP has to be all things to all people in 10 minutes only and this is untenable. In this time we have to deal with the polypharmacised multiply morbid patient who has several problems to discuss. We have to manage an increasing amount of clinical work transferred from secondary to primary care. We have to deal with the manipulative, the dangerous and the deluded. We have to deal with those with shopping lists of demands, the worried well, those sent by third parties for proof of just about anything. We have to deal with the longwinded, the demented, the unhappy, the angry. We have to deal with the worried parent and the sick child. We have to deal with the medical emergency or those who think it is an emergency. The list goes on. We are accessible to everyone, every single being has the right to walk in to discuss anything; there is no filter, no prior discussion to see whether a trip to a GP is appropriate or suitable.
We pay an emotional price for constant availability for everything the world throws at us.
GPs can be bullied and manipulated by a public who increasingly demand certainty and rights and a bureaucracy that seeks to medicalise social problems. In all this we have no support. We were trained to help others’ suffering, not manage our own. We pay an emotional price for constant availability for everything the world throws at us (and I mean everything), and a professionalism that is never acknowledged or meaningfully supported. We face the relentless expectations of the ten minute appointment, the constantly full waiting rooms, the unacceptable waiting times to be seen and feel constantly punished because we cannot meet them. I can honestly say that in all my time as a GP principle, I can count on one hand the times I did not have a fully booked surgery. Government policy, patient expectation, pressure on our staff mean that we are constantly in the wrong, on the back foot, for not delivering a service that, quite frankly, is impossible to provide. We are supposed to be made of teflon, have no feelings, cope with the relentless daily, monthly, yearly pressure of not delivering the impossibly perfect service that this society believes is their right.
Patient expectations
Expectations by patients have changed over my thirty years in practice. Society has changed; the consumer approach, the belief that everything should have an answer, the inability to accept the uncertainty of life and health; the belief that if something goes wrong someone must be to blame have all increased over time. Expectations increasingly fuelled by the unrealistic claims made on the internet. Also the idea that everyone should have instant access, instant answers, has grown. These expectations are not really compatible with what GPs do, namely manage uncertainty. Because of this GPs have been harried into increasing amounts of patient tests, often with no clear goal in mind and no evidence that it would be useful. On the contrary, tests breed insecurity and more tests, because doctors feel the need to cover themselves, to insure themselves against patients demanding ever more certainty. It is ironic that in an age when the population has never been more healthy or long lived, health uncertainty and anxiety increases. Adding to patient expectations is the medicalisation of human sadness. The belief that a doctor can make grief, sadness, the ordinary difficulties of life better with a pill or therapy seems to have increased steadily over the years.
Lack of resources
Mental health services were reason enough to leave general practice.
GPs are damned if they do and damned if they don’t. We are placed in impossible double binds by chronic NHS underfunding and then blamed for the outcomes. Classic examples are the exploitation of our gate keeping roles by saying we must refer less into secondary care and then blaming us for not diagnosing enough cancers. We are held responsible for not diagnosing the rarest of cancers, which have no characteristic sets of symptoms, and yet demonised or refused by secondary care if we refer patients like these in.
Mental health services were reason enough to leave general practice. The NHS in my area refused to fund or possibly organise an even half functioning service and given society’s propensity for medicalising any adverse human experience we were imprisoned in the ultimate double bind and for us it was a life sentence. Throughout my entire career I was supposed to deal with the mentally distressed in ten minute appointments with no credible back up. The media slammed us for handing out too many antidepressants giving the impression that we had any alternatives. Trust me, we did not. The stark choices for GPs dealing with mental distress ranging from overt psychosis to a little sadness were a prescription for a pill then and there and a bit more than ten minutes (thereby pressurising everyone else in the waiting room), or a referral for a mental health treatment, be it talking therapy or more assessment which might occur within the next 3 to 6 months. The icing on the cake was that despite a GP referral, the mental health service might decide, several weeks later, not to offer any treatment at all. Truly GPs backs are up against the wall when dealing with mental health problems, which on a conservative estimate, take up to 20% of their work. Indeed, there is a psychological component to all disease. Dealing with mental health services throughout my career was the most excruciating and depressing aspect of my job.
Another problem caused by underfunding, which inexorably worsened throughout my time in practice, was waiting times. This has caused the NHS to become cruel in its dealing with suffering patients. I have seen people with severe, debilitating, painful conditions having to wait up to a year to be seen in secondary care. And then they get sent for tests, have to wait months for their results, and then they have to wait further months for follow up in clinics to get the results of said tests. Hospital doctors never make decisions without panels of tests that seem to grow larger by the year. Meanwhile the GP is the only doctor a patient can directly access while waiting for all these events, the walls are very high around secondary care, and we are expected to manage their pain, anxiety and frustration with no power to change anything. As usual, there is no support for the GP managing the patient in this vacuum and the more compassionate the GP, the more likely they are to be broken by this powerlessness in the face of suffering.
Complexity
Patients are becoming increasingly complex. They live longer, are on more medication and often have two, three or even more co-existing conditions. We are expected to deal with their needs in ten minutes, or consider their problems in the little time we have between fire-fighting paperwork and results and managing the practice. Meanwhile secondary care is becoming more specialised with increasing numbers of silos. A patient goes to a hospital clinic where a specialist has the luxury of dealing with one condition only, with all the back up of a hospital department. And it can happen that the decision a specialist makes about the one condition that is their remit will have a knock on effect for the other conditions a patient might have. It is left to the GP to sort it out. A record achieved by one of my patients was that he visited seven different specialties on a regular basis, all of which dealt with one aspect of his care and none of which could come up with an overarching explanation for his symptoms. Needless to say I had ten minutes to deal with all of them. The use of protocols, guidelines and non-doctor vetting of secondary care referrals also lead to GP stress, not to say cruelty to the patient. The silos are getting narrower, secondary care clinicians are more and more empowered to say what they will not deal with . Meanwhile GPs have to deal with their rejections with no support for their suffering patients.
Polypharmacy
This is a real problem in the ten minute appointment. All evidence based medicine derives from studies on single conditions and all medication guidelines come from them. The problem is that very few patients have only one condition. The GP has to juggle co-prescribed medications with their multiplicity of interactions and side effects in each individual, very difficult in a busy surgery with a waiting room full of patients expecting to be seen on time. Ironically when the community pharmacists started to be involved in the Scottish NHS new contract, they stated they would need thirty minutes per patient. And a pharmacist would only be dealing with medications while the GP has to deal with the actual patient’s agenda, which may be something else entirely. Prescribing outwith the consultation has also become more onerous over the last few years as drug shortages and the increasing prescribing demands of secondary care have to be managed.
Poorly understood conditions/somatisation/chronic pain
Some of the hardest patients to deal with, the most time consuming and emotionally draining, are the ones that don’t fit into neat diagnostic boxes, yet constantly present with suffering and demand answers. These patients are not recognised by, and certainly not treated by secondary care. For example, those people with chronic pain for which we actually have no effective medication. Synthetic opiates, the only treatment out there, do not work and turn them into addicts. Any attempts at psychological reframing of their conditions are seriously resisted by the patients, and to be frank, the medical establishment.
There seems to be a belief that GP is elastic can continuously absorb extra work indefinitely.
The Cartesian dualism that bedevils our concepts of illness means that patients and many doctors think that the ultimate insult is to suggest that their suffering is ‘all in their head’ and for some strange reason does not then exist. Unfortunately GPs are faced with a number of patients who manifest their life distress with physical symptoms, call it somatisation for want of a better term, for whom existing medicine has no treatment and who become bitterly entrenched in their illness behaviour as they feel less and less cared for. The ‘fibromyalgics’, the chronically fatigued, for whom there is no realistic therapy and for which GPs have no training or support. I am not surprised that so many of them turn to snake oil salesman and quacks who at least provide them with attention before exploiting their vulnerabilities.
Outsourcing of secondary care work
Over the years, general practice has been subjected to a form of ‘mission creep’ with secondary care demanding that we increasingly do work that was originally done in hospital medicine. While it may seem reasonable that GPs manage new atrial fibrillation or perform near patient testing, this is added to our already increasing workload. There seems to be a belief that GP is elastic can continuously absorb extra work indefinitely. There is only so much work that we can take before we break.
Housebound patients
While home visit rates have gone down, housebound patients are becoming increasingly complex so that visits can resemble ward rounds in a geriatric hospital. Patients are often on medications and have conditions that need frequent monitoring and repeat visits that we are not resourced to manage. Latterly, I became increasingly concerned about our cohort of usually elderly, frail housebound patients on complex, potentially dangerous treatment regimes who were poorly managed in the community. General practice as it stands is just not equipped to deal with these people.
Conclusion
I think the chief thing to emphasise is that GPs stand alone, and are chronically under resourced. We may work in group practices and have our administration staff, but once the door is closed, it is just the GP and the patient in the room together. And in real time we have no support, indeed we have no formal support networks at all on the ground. There is no-one to catch us as we fall, we have no protection from the ire of the public, anger that is usually caused by a system that fails to deliver what has been promised. We stand and fall by the decisions we make in ten minutes and if things go wrong, the full weight of public and professional opprobrium lands on our heads. There is no safety net, no cavalry coming over the hill to relieve us.
Now, I have retired and I do not miss any of it. I was well thought of by my patients and staff to judge by the feedback I have received over the years and the overwhelming number of cards and presents I received when I retired. I also got on with and liked my partners. Yet a powerful emotion I associate with my time in general practice was one of failure. I had failed to deliver a good service and so now I am just relieved to be free of it. However, what does bother me is that I had a wealth of knowledge and skills, accumulated over lifetime, which I will never use again.
Yet there is no place for me now in my profession, general practice has lost my skills and those of all my retired peers completely.
And what does strike me is that perhaps my profession could benefit from my and my peers’ experience. I could perhaps mentor younger GPs, newly practising partners, and provide them with the support I never had. I can read a face, interpret its subtle movements, be aware of another’s suffering. I can listen actively and frame peoples’ stories empathetically and positively. I can pull out the essential points in a narrative, summarise a conversation, help someone form a plan for the future. I can listen. Yet there is no place for me now in my profession, general practice has lost my skills and those of all my retired peers completely. I feel that this is a shame as we are a resource that could be utilised for the good of the profession.
As for the future of general practice, I do not trust the Scottish NHS and the health boards to deliver the supposed new Scottish GP contract. They mouth platitudes but follow their own agendas rather than those of general practice, they have not trusted GPs to execute the changes and allocated funds seem to have dissipated in a plethora of talking shops and committees. It seems that the further you remove practitioners, the people who actually do the work, from decisions about how the work is done, the less successful the outcome. Unfortunately, GPs have been so busy actually doing their jobs, they have not had the time or emotional energy to fight for a new contract that works for them. I have little hope that the new contract will result in better experiences for patients or their doctors.
However, it can be argued that innovation, out of the box thinking comes from those without an interest in the system, so let’s throw the problem of how to run an NHS out there. Let all and sundry chew on it, because I don’t expect those within the system to come up with any answers. Lets hope someone has thought of something before the inevitable happens to me and I become a patient.

Thank you so very much for putting my sentiments down in such an eloquent way. I left my partnership in Glasgow recently aged 55 for the reasons you have outilined. I waited for the new contract and knew it was inadequate and resigned my partnership.
“the more compassionate the GP, the more likely they are to be broken by this powerlessness in the face of suffering”- this especially very much summed up my experience.
I now locum and feel more protected and distanced from the toxic work conditions expected of me by myself, patients, the NHS and the SG. I feel my experience of 30years as a doctor is wasted and I just have to suck it up and not dwell on it. That’s life! A shame when there is so much capacity of compassion and skill to give to people, given the right conditions.

Hi, given the current situation, perhaps we should view Active GP as something that you do for a finite time only, as part of a “portfolio career “ not a whole working lifetime. Rather you spend sometime at the frontline, then move onto less stressful jobs having done your bit. The question would be what to move on to that we have the skills and training for, apart from locum work. Also I think most people would agree that the more experienced the doctor the better practitioner they are. Always remembering that experience can just mean making the same mistakes with increasing confidence!

I also took early retirement from GP Partnership at 56 and have not regretted it. As I walked out of my surgery for the last time I almost literally felt a weight lifted from my shoulders. I share the author’s regret that I can’t continue to use the wisdom and experience gained over 30 years to help patients and relieve some of the burden from my younger colleagues.

Wow. Thank you for a brilliant, honest piece. I’m relatively early in my GP career and I recognise ALL of what you say. At the moment, the good outweighs the bad for me in GP, but I do wonder if I have the resilience to stay the distance. The lesson for me is: look after yourself and each other, because everyone else will milk you as dry as you let them.
I have saved this article for future reference and sharing. Thank you again.

I also took early retirement at 59 now nearly 7 years ago. This article describes my feelings too (OK in England not Scotland). I feel too that stopping work lifted a burden from me and regret at never being able to do the job to the best of my ability due to constant time pressure. The skills I gained in listening to my patients for over 30 years are no longer available to the NHS, as new less experienced doctors are assumed to be of equal value to the NHS. Bums on seats can be counted and that’s what appears to matter to those counting and making the rules.

Thanks for all your comments. Perhaps the RCGP should consider the mentoring idea! I refer to the comment I made above about limited stints at the front line. Sadly, in Scotland there is a shortage of new GPS and practices have had to shut up shop because of this. Clare

Clair, your comments eloquently outline the challenges and unreasonable demands placed on GP’s and 5 years ago I faced the same dilemma in my English practice of 30 years, and at 58 I too decided it was time to leave. I then decided to tackle a different challenge and moved to a much smaller remote and rural practice in the Hebrides as an NHS salaried partner. Surgeries and lists became smaller and I now have the luxury of time to spend with the patients and have the support of fabulous community staff. The experience and knowledge I’ve accumulated has been well used and I’ve truly enjoyed this final phase of my medical career, and I’m still working here
5 years later!
We are privileged to have the job we do, but time pressures can certainly prevent us giving our patients the service they deserve.

What a brilliantly written article. Comprehensively details why GP is failing and will likely not exist, at least in its current format, in the next 10-15 years. GP is the Walmart of medicine, pile them in, stack them high – all you can fit, anything and everything in a 10min appt. It is popular with politicians as they need cheap medicine by GPs to subsidise the expensive specialists and keep the tax payers happy with lower tax rates.
Unfortunately the real world is not like the Dr Who Tardis and time does not expand. GPs are human and to remain humane, we need to self care to avoid burnout. For some it will be time to boundary patients, for others it will be time to cut back on sessions and and for many it is time to look for alternative careers. I used to look at GPs as a child in the 1980s with deep respect and awe, they had status and commanded respect from their peers. These times no longer exist. Now each day is a battle for many if not most. I left the NHS year ago and will not return, I wish those of you who remain the best.

This has been one of the best short reads describing what GP life has become and I can’t disagree with any of it. Strange thing is, like the Gp reply above, who moved to a small rural practice , and enjoying his last 5 years, I too have honestly rarely ever had a bad day in my 30 years as a GP partner now aged 58 Wales. Small personalised list 2750 (weighted list 3500) in a 2 person (1.5fte) so 4 day week. The single biggest reason I remain happy and peaceful in the midst of the plethora of issues you so eloquently describe is for me they all become so much milder/manageable/solvable when there is someone who armed with a life time knowledge of their small 1300-1500 patients characters, expectations and illnesses, finds decisions and tests ,mail and the whole lot becomes quicker easier, more thorough.Its not that I am not busy ,it’s just not always busy. It’s not that I am better as I am not.
From what I see and hear in the profession generally, I can’t see a sustainable way forward for Primary care unless we rapidly move to personalised lists, yes in group partnerships supported by HCSW/Nurses/PA/admin . I mean where you are solely responsible for your own patients, not someone else’s,not strangers,not patients who try and manipulate new GPs. Yes seek 2nd opinions occasionally, Expect yes a day off each week where similar partner /colleagues cover any emergencies.No long waits to be seen . Telephone first less necessary, “Rubbish“ I hear some think,but I maintain it is all very possible because my experience is the time saving and in depth supervision by one GP of an almost totally “known” population really does yield the time and space to let us cope,grow and even thrive.
Most complex illnesses become less stressful as you have been with them through it all and know them almost as well as they do. Your previous consultation laid out the actions you would do if they returned. Ten minutes often plenty bar the first new complex illness, no more long history taking by talented GPs who have little knowledge of the patient multiplied a thousand times a year .Less mental stress and clinician anxiety.
Add in HCSW, social Prescribing and decent mental health services and it become a real pleasure and something even at 58 I don’t wish to give up.
Planning 2 days a week till 65.
You asked for a solution. There it is. Not meant to be Patronising. Personalised lists where you and only you ,95% of the time have to make the decisions that will affect your workplace tomorrow and next week Is the way ahead. .Claire, please don’t stay away, seek a small practice as you are incredibly valuable. As for me I am planning 2 days a week till 65.

I am a 50 year old GP working in North West England. I could not agree more with everything that is written in this article. I am a very robust individual and continue to work as a Partner in a large practice with great colleagues. However I have seen many very good people “broken” (alcoholism, Depression, burn out) by the toxic environment of General Practice.Good UK GPs are some of the finest and hard working General Physicians in the world. In the last 10 years I have come to the conclusion that the NHS is not fit for purpose in the current world and never will be. The sooner the NHS becomes a private insurance based service then the sooner GPs will be able to control their workload / quality of care and lead a full rewarding working life that does not “break them”.

Clair, what a beautifully written article.
Thank you.
Last year I initiated the project “Rediscover the Joy of General Practice” https://www.srmc.scot.nhs.uk/joy-project/
It is specifically designed for GPs like you coming up for retirement but who feel they have more to give, but not under the pressures you describe.
It began as a collaboration between NHS Orkney, Shetland, Western Isles and Highland and this year has expanded to include other Scottish Health Boards.
It is based on work undertaken in Orkney over the last 10 years.
We offer contracts of between 6-18+ weeks/year to undertake practice attachments for periods of 1-4 weeks at a time. Travel from a Scottish city and accommodation is paid for, meaning that GPs do not need to relocate.
Our philosophy is based on supporting the practices and staff in all aspects of GP work and quality improvement.
Have a look at the website to understand the scheme more fully.
In 2019 we recruited 33 GPs to our Rural GP Support Team, many were retiring GPs who have felt reinvigorated by working with us.
This year we have expanded the scheme to involve the whole of Scotland and not just rural practices.
Currently we have shortlisted a further 35 GPs.
Although we have officially closed, we will still accept late applications and will reopen to applications again once we have established this second team.
What is interesting is that as our team expands and develops we suddenly find that we have the opportunity to consider how we can tackle what previously seemed intractable problems.
All members of the team are encouraged to contribute their ideas of how we could tackle thorny issues and due to the phenomenal depth of experience and expertise among our GPs we find ourselves in an unusually empowered position.
The project is led by the Primary Care Associate Medical Directors and Managers from the participating Health Boards and has the full backing of the Scottish Government.
We are at an early stage and certainly do not have all the answers, but we are determined to try and make a difference.
Working together with vision, determination and lateral thinking I believe we can make real changes – however, I am a self-confessed irresponsible optimist!
Anyone interested, do have a look at the website and please feel free to join us.
Claire, I would very much like to have a chat with you and to explore some of your ideas.

Video consultations: a guide for practice
Posted by BJGP Life | 18 Mar 2020 | Coronavirus | 0
Many practices are now using or considering using alternatives to face-to-face consultations because of concerns about Covid-19. Important new information and guidance is now available to support video consultations. Produced by researchers at the University of Oxford, the document covers five key topics. When are video consultations appropriate, how can a practice get ready for them, how can clinicians conduct high-quality video consultations, what can patients do to prepare for and take part in them, and what is the research evidence for their quality and safety?
This document is packed with extremely useful, practical advice and tips to help doctors,other primary care clinicians, and patients navigate these almost uncharted waters at a time of unprecedented challenge for the health service.
The PDF document with the full guidance is available below and can be downloaded.°
Consultations vidéo: informations pour les médecins en cabinet (French version) can be accessed here.°
Versión en espagñol (Spanish version) can be accessed here.°
It is written by Trisha Greenhalgh, on behalf of the IRIHS research group at the University of Oxford, with input from Clare Morrison of Scottish Government Technology Enabled Care Programme and Professor Gerald Koh Choon Huat from National University of Singapore
Summary
COVID-19 creates an unprecedented situation. Many GP practices are considering introducing video consultations as a matter of urgency to reduce risk of contagion.
This preliminary document covers five questions:
When are video consultations appropriate in primary care?
How can a GP practice get set up for video consultations?
How can a clinician conduct a high-quality video consultation in primary care?
How should patients prepare for, and participate in, video consultations?
What is the research evidence for the quality and safety of video consultations?

My story of everyday scholarship in general practice
Posted by BJGP Life | 26 Apr 2017 | Opinion, Scholarship | 1
Faraz Mughal is a GP in Birmingham and the RCGP Clinical Fellow in Children and Young People’s Mental Health. He is on Twitter: @farazhmughal
Making scholarship part of my daily practice contributes to the intellectual challenge and enjoyment of my work in general practice.
Self-harm affects 1 in 12 child or young people (CYP).1 Nearly 10% of 5-16 year-olds have a mental health illness which means in an average school class of 30 schoolchildren, three will suffer from a diagnosable mental health disorder. With increasing pressures facing young people in all aspects of their lives, the rates of mental illness are likely to rise. CYP mental health is thus a challenge for GPs everywhere.
At the frontline, we as GPs detect mental health illness; whether it presents as a physical health symptom, through parental/family concern, or simply an instinct you have when seeing a CYP in surgery. It is known that CYP with mental illness are twice as likely to attend to see their GP.1 Mental health is something we should be all thinking in every CYP we see.
But it can be an area of practice that we all find difficult, we can feel uncomfortable tackling this clinical area. Locally GPs have described, both personal issues (a lack of training) and service problems (difficulties accessing specialist services) as reasons for this.
In my own practice, I realised that there were limited resources available in this area and that accessing support from specialist services was difficult. I explored this further and realised others were experiencing similar problems. So, I began to think about how I could help address this, how I could improve my own practice while also helping the wider primary care community?
When RCGP advertised an opportunity to become the RCGP Clinical Fellow for CYP Mental Health I grabbed the chance to apply (these are regularly advertised through the RCGP so do keep an eye out!). Through this role, I have been part of an enthusiastic team developing quick-access resources for GPs and primary care staff to use in consultations with patients (accessed through the RCGP Mental Health Toolkit: http://www.rcgp.org.uk/clinical-and-research/toolkits/mental-health-toolkit.aspx). I also have the chance to influence policy through pushing for improvements in national and local services for CYP mental health. In addition, we have developed ‘TopTips’ articles for GPs on self-harm and eating disorders in CYP with more in the pipeline.
We are always thinking of how we can support GPs and if you would like to get involved with the college on working in this area, please do get in touch, we would be really pleased to hear from GPs and primary care professionals who want to work with us.

Casting down the pseudo-religion of clinical examination
Posted by Des Spence | 10 Jun 2016 | Clinical, Opinion, Undergraduate | 1
The glass bounced off my back and smashed into the drinks gantry shattering a whisky bottle. All I remember is the glass, the blood and that terrible screaming. Glass fights are dangerous, especially as barman, and for $1.80 an hour I often wondered if it was worth it. But it had its compensations for it was the best practical module on communication skills I ever had and I have used my experiences everyday of my medical career. Teaching undergraduates for the last 10 years I have enjoyed regaling them with my ‘pub communication’ stories.
I am convinced of the value of teaching communication skills but what of the scared cow, clinical examination? I was taught by rote – rigid application of clinical skills – inspection, palpation, auscultation and percussion. I was humiliated for not hearing split heart sounds, ridiculed for missing bronchial breathing, scolded for not saying “ninety-ninety” instead of “one-one-one” and I was laughed at for missing a breech presentation.
My objection is not that many of my tutors had a charisma bypass nor their dissocial personality disorders, my issue is that most of what they taught me to be unquestionable ‘fact’ was in reality complete nonsense. I will go further, not only were most of the clinical signs utterly worthless but many are downright dangerous.
How many times have I heard creps at the lung bases and in good faith organized a chest x-ray only for this to be reported 16 weeks later as being normal? I wonder about the times clinical examination has falsely reassured me leading to a delay in diagnosis – to my shame I can think of a few. The real unquestionable fact is that clinical examination is neither sensitive nor specific and devoid of any quantifiable predictive value of disease. Let’s be honest, most of clinical examination is merely the pseudo-religious ceremony of medicine passed down from our distant pagan healer ancestors.
I am, however, forced to pass these dark arts onto the next generation of unsuspecting doctors (secretly I subvert the students but please don’t tell my university). Even the iconic stethoscope is in reality little more than a simple stage prop used by insecure junior doctors who lack the gravitas to convince patients that they are doctors.
It is time for the unbearable and unthinkable but we must cast down the false deity that is clinical examination. In the new dawn light we should take the few worthwhile glittering gems from clinical examination but ditch the rest. Instead, let us teach students about health seeking behaviour, dealing with uncertainty and how to rationally investigate and manage common presenting symptoms. This might end the modern tsunami approach to investigations whose huge yield of minor incidental findings then burst and flood out the NHS outpatients. This might actually help prevent the rampant health neurosis that we as a profession are thoughtlessly inflicting on our poor patients.
Please, put your tumblers down for one last moment as I have a final point of heresy. Ultrasound is cheap, quick and easy, so why don’t we teach students to use an ultrasound probe? This could be used in many different clinical situations but I guess it might be heavy to wear round the neck! All I remember is the glass, the blood and that terrible screaming.

Des, I wholeheartedly agree with your opinion that the use of ultrasound should be more widespread and, in the era of pocket echos, the days of using the stethoscope for listening to heart sounds may be numbered. But I have to say I disagree with your bleak assessment of the value of physical examination.
In my opinion, improving physical examination skills can only reduce the burden of investigation because it is when we are most uncertain that we cast off on the fishing expeditions of scatter gun investigations.
If nothing else the physical exam is a form of communication, it’s a way of demonstrating to the patient that you are taking them seriously and looking more deeply into their complaint. And, if you’re going to do it for that reason, you may as well be trained to make it of some diagnostic value as well.

A BJGP Christmas Carol: Part Three
Posted by BJGP Life | 19 Dec 2018 | Stories | 0
Peter Aird is a GP in Bridgwater, Somerset.
This is part three of a five part series. If you can’t wait and like to binge read then you can download the full five part version for free as an epub or mobi file for use with your Kindle or other e-reader.
Stave Three – in which our tale takes a darker turn
In the few minutes he had to think before the next ghostly visitor was due to arrive, Scrooge reflected on the events of the evening so far and wondered if he should try to claim a few hours of CPD. However, anxious as to how his appraiser might respond to such revelations and fearful that his reflections may be used against him, he concluded, as many before him, that it would be best not to put his thoughts down in writing.
He then realised that it was almost half past two. Was he not to be visited again tonight after all? But within a moment, he was woken from his reverie by the sound of his bedroom door bursting open and the arrival of a rather flustered looking figure entering the room. She was carrying a pile of papers in one hand whilst tapping into the mobile phone she held with the other.
‘I’m sorry to keep you waiting,’ the spectre began. ‘I’ve been so busy tonight and the last chap I visited had several issues that he wanted me to provide spiritual insight on. Blow me if he didn’t have a list! Now what seems to be the problem? I am the Ghost of General Practice Present. Did you have any ideas, concerns or expectations as to how I might haunt you?’
Scrooge looked back at the apparition somewhat non-plussed. He hadn’t asked for the visit and, other than his previous encounters that night, had no experience of consulting with individuals from beyond the grave. Though highly concerned by the present turn of events and expecting to find the whole thing highly disagreeable, he had very little idea as to quite how the encounter should progress. Consequently, Scrooge said nothing.
‘Oh dear,’ said the ghost, unnerved by Scrooge’s silence, ‘This is awkward. I told Marley that there was little point in my visiting you without you being willing to see me. You see it’s so hard to help somebody unless they realise they have a problem and want to be helped.’
Still Scrooge found himself lost for words.
Rather than using the silence as a technique for therapeutic communication, the ghost laid the papers that she had been carrying down upon Scrooge’s bed and started flipping through the pages. ‘I’m sure there is a guideline for this situation somewhere. Give me a minute and I’ll be with you as soon as I find it. I don’t want to get this wrong.’ A few minutes passed, at the end of which the ghost seemed to have found what it was that she was looking for. ‘Ah yes, that’s it – come with me. I’m to show you how Christmas is being spent by others this year. Only I’m running short of time so we’ll have to make it quick.’
Once again, Scrooge was taken by the hand but, somewhat to his disappointment, she led him down the stairs in the conventional fashion before continuing through the front door and out into the night. ‘I’m afraid that these days we don’t employ the use of magic flight,’ the spirit explained, ‘There’s no evidence for it, you see. It’s all evidence-based hauntings these days.’
The fog had thickened making it difficult to see where they were going but the ghost still had hold of her phone and had entered the postcode of their destination into Google maps. Before long they reached a block of flats and proceeded to climb the communal stairs. On the second floor, they passed through the wall into the home of a young family, the spirit assuring Scrooge as they did so, that the Celestial Institute for Ethereal Excellence had approved, in highly selected cases, what was known in the profession as quantum tunnelling, provided said cases met stringent eligibility criteria.
The flat bore witness to the fact that it was Christmas Day. The mantelpiece and sideboard were covered with Christmas cards and coloured paper chains were hanging from the ceiling. In the corner was a Christmas tree under which a three year old boy was happily making good use of the colouring set he had recently unwrapped. He stood up and walked into the kitchen where his parents were preparing dinner. They turned to him and noticed that he was covered in red spots. Immediately his mother emptied the pint glass of Prosecco she was drinking and used it to perform the ‘tumbler test’, her anxiety being heightened all the more when the rash failed to disappear. She pressed the speed dial button on her phone and called ‘111’.
‘I’m worried about my son – he’s covered in spots,’ she exclaimed to the call handler. ‘No – he seems well in himself… No, no vomiting or fever… No, no headache or tummy pain… No, no catastrophic loss of blood… and no – he has just the one head.’ The list of negatives continued until the questioner focused in on the rash. ‘Well, it’s almost as if he’s been marking himself with a red felt tip pen!’ The women listened to the call handler for a few moments longer before ending the call.
‘What did they say?’ her partner asked.
‘Something about a non-blanching rash being possible meningitis and that it’s better to be safe than sorry. They’re sending an ambulance.’
‘Bloomin’ right too. Now let me refill your glass, we can’t have you sober when it arrives!’
The Ghost of Christmas Present indicated to Scrooge that it was time to move on. Their next stop was just across the stairwell. Passing once more through the walls of the property, Scrooge recognised Mrs Gray, the frail elderly lady who lived there, as one of his patients. She was nearing the end of her life due to her having advanced metastatic disease. A single Christmas card lay face down on the dining room table, alongside of which was a box of chocolates she had bought for herself in an attempt to make Christmas Day, the fifth she’d have spent alone since the death of her husband, at least a little special. She knew it would probably be her last. As Scrooge looked on, the woman picked up the chocolates and shuffled slowly across the room and then, for want of anyone else to give them to, placed them in the kitchen bin.
‘What’s she doing?’ Scrooge asked the spirit.
‘She doesn’t think you’d approve if she ate them’ replied the ghost, who then proceeded to point to a letter held to the fridge door by a magnet commemorating the Queen’s Silver Jubilee. It was from Scrooge’s medical practice informing her that her recent routine blood tests had revealed that she had a slightly elevated HbA1c and that she was therefore classified as ‘pre diabetic’. Included with the letter was a leaflet giving helpful advice on healthy eating.
Scrooge stood staring at the woman. He realised that, though if asked to relay the ins and outs of all her most recent blood tests he would have been up to the task, in recent years at least, he’d not really known her at all.
The spirit had left the flat and Scrooge hurried to catch her up. They walked together without talking until they came to a house that Scrooge had never visited before. Here they stopped and stood outside the window of a dimly lit room. Peering in through the poorly drawn curtains they could see the figure of Bob Cratchit. He was sat, his head in his hands, surrounded by various medical textbooks. To his left was a half empty bottle of scotch and a packet of antidepressants. He was writing a note.
Scrooge turned to the Ghost of General Practice. ‘What’s he doing?’ he asked.
‘Struggling’ she replied.
‘But why? He’s such a good doctor.’
‘He is indeed. But he doesn’t know it. He has come to believe that he has to be perfect – that every guideline must be followed and a failure to do so will result in legal action being taken against him. He’s taken on the burden that comes from believing that medicine has the answer to every problem experienced by a broken society. He thinks it’s all down to him. He has been worn down by the constant demand from both society and the profession that he must perform better – that good enough is not good enough. He’s exhausted by the never ending assessment of his performance and crushed by the weight of the responsibility he feels. He lives in the constant fear that it’ll all be his fault if anything bad ever happens. He too feels all alone this Christmas.’
‘But this afternoon? He asked to leave early to spend some time with his family.’
‘Indeed he did but the truth is that he hasn’t much in the way of a family – just a couple of friends he thinks of as family. In reality he had hoped to meet those friends for a drink but things didn’t quite work out the way they were planned. When he left the surgery late yesterday he went back to check on one of the patients he’d visited. Their condition had deteriorated and he arranged an admission but he was left feeling guilty and anxious. As a result he didn’t think he’d make very good company. And besides, he was worried about his CSA exam and thought the time would be better spent preparing for that.’
‘But he’ll pass the exam easily,’ Scrooge exclaimed. ‘He’s come on leaps and bounds since that unfortunate misunderstanding the first time round. The patients love him – and the staff. He’ll make a great GP.’
‘Have you ever told him that?’
Scrooge fell silent. Perhaps he could have been a bit more supportive, encouraged a little more. Perhaps he could have helped him steer a course through the mass of expectation and enabled him to distinguish between what was genuinely important and what could appropriately be ignored. Perhaps he could have been the kind of trainer Fezziwig had been to him – one who, despite the changes enforced on the profession, could still see the joy of working in general practice and convey a little of that to the next generation – one who would fight for what was worth fighting for rather than retreating into cynicism, bitterness, and resentment.
‘I never knew he felt so alone. I never knew he was finding it so hard.’
‘Did you ever ask?’
Scrooge’s head fell. ‘Can I speak to him now?’
‘I’m afraid not. He won’t be able hear you, and what’s more our time is up. We must go.’
‘But I must do something.’
‘That’s as maybe – but you have another appointment to keep. You must meet the Ghost of General Practice Yet To Come.’
The ghost started back towards Scrooge’s home. Scrooge himself lingered a little longer at the window in the hope that Cratchit would see him and appreciate his concern. Finally he turned his back on the scene and trudged slowly after the ghost who was now some yards ahead of him. Behind him, Cratchit slipped silently into the deepest of deep sleeps.
The spirit accompanied Scrooge back to his room but, before she left, she had one small request.
‘I’d be most grateful if you could fill in this form by way of giving feedback on my performance this evening. And it would be very helpful if you could indicate whether you’d feel able to recommend me to your friends and family… ‘
Regretting the choice of words even as she spoke them, an awkward silence arose between them. The spirit looked at Scrooge and Scrooge looked back
‘… or perhaps just an acquaintance… a passer-by even?’
Sensing that now was clearly not the time, the Spirit said a hurried goodbye and left, leaving Scrooge alone with his thoughts. He couldn’t stop thinking about what he’d seen. He tried to convince himself it was all a dream, that none of it was real. Had things really become this bad? And could the future be worse? He had a feeling he was about to find out.

Bristol and Exeter Student GP societies: working hard to promote general practice
Posted by BJGP Life | 26 Nov 2015 | Undergraduate | 2
Alice James is a 4th year medical student at Bristol University. She is passionate about promoting general practice to other students in her role as Chair of the University GP Society (Bristol GPSoc) and student representative for the Severn Faculty RCGP.
Nilakshini is a 4th year medical student based in Exeter and is passionate about general practice. She believes it’s time to put the stigma associated with primary care behind us and start giving recognition for the challenging and exciting career that it really is.
The Bristol and Exeter Student GP societies aim to inspire members to consider a career in general practice through showcasing general practice as a versatile and fulfilling career and by challenging the stigmas associated with the profession by addressing controversial issues in the field. The societies provide CV-boosting advice, information about the GP training programme and hold events involving GPs with backgrounds ranging from conservation medicine and broadcast journalism to GPs with specialist interests.
Exeter student GP society, founded only in 2015, has initiated monthly practical teaching sessions for students in their pre-clinical years. This has been very popular so far and we are hoping to extend this mentoring scheme for students in their clinical years as well. This year the GP society are excited to introduce our inaugural debate under the auspices of Devon and Exeter Medical Society, ‘Are the increasing portion of female doctors, a key contributor for GP shortages?’. We hope that by addressing relevant and topical issues we can successfully challenge the negative stigmas associated with a career in general practice. Holding the event with the Devon and Exeter Medical society also provides students the opportunity meet and interact with general practitioners who are passionate about their career.
Bristol GPSoc, now in its 4th year, is planning to extend their annual conference to a full-day event to include student poster presentations and added workshops. The society is also planning a clinical skills workshop suitable for both pre-clinical and clinical years as an OSCE revision session. As well as stand-alone events, Bristol GPSoc has also joined forces with other University and Bristol-based societies. Last week the society held its first event of the year: ‘Mental Health: The Psychiatry-Primary Care Interface’ together with the Bristol University psychiatry society (PsychSoc). We heard from 2 local GPs, a consultant liaison psychiatrist and the founder of the mental health charity ‘Student Minds’. The 4 speakers addressed different ways of promoting better mental health by exemplifying methods used in their working environments. Approaches included peer support groups, self-care smart phone apps and services offered within GP services themselves including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and self-hypnosis.
Both societies have benefited hugely from support given by local RCGP Faculties. Exeter GP society would like to thank Tamar Faculty for the funding and GP reading list which they have kindly provided. Furthermore, Tamar Faculty RCGP have recently co- opted the Chair of Exeter GPSoc onto their board as student representative. Following this, Bristol GPSoc enquired whether Severn Faculty RCGP had would be willing to open up a similar role on their board at the next AGM. As a result, the current Bristol GPSoc Chair was elected as the Severn Faculty student representative at the start of this month. Severn Faculty also allows other students to attend board meetings as observers and provides elective bursaries every year for Bristol students undertaking an elective within a primary care setting.
University backing is also essential to the development of student GP societies. Bristol GPSoc committee members have been invited to GP teacher training days and have been involved in the University-wide curriculum review by the Centre for Academic Primary Care. In addition, the University of Bristol medical student society (Galenicals) have given support by advertising events, providing funding and holding a medical student Freshers’ fair to promote student-led societies. Exeter Medical school also played a key role in setting up the GP society and are often good port of contact for the committee members.
At the most recent RCGP conference, one of the RCGP Associate in Training (AiT) committee representatives, Jodie Blackadder-Coward, organised a meeting for student GPSoc representatives from around the UK. This provided an opportunity to communicate ideas that we can then relay to a national body. Suggestions discussed by students and RCGP committee members included formal affiliation of GPSocs with the college, guidance on elective opportunities in primary care and deliberation of having a foundation year doctor on their GP committee.
Support from the RCGP and individual Universities will be fundamental to the continued growth and development of GP societies and to facilitate communication between them. We hope
both Severn and Tamar RCGP Faculties will continue to advertise the role of student representative to medical students in future years and that other RCGP Faculties will follow suit. Such opportunities have enabled both societies to voice our ideas and concerns with the hope of making an impact at both the undergraduate and specialty training level. The recently forged links between the GP Societies at the Universities of Exeter, Plymouth, Bristol and Cardiff have allowed us to share ideas and extend invitations to events. We have also discussed the prospect of a collaborative event to attract students and junior doctors from across the South West.

Great work both of you. It is so important that general practice has an equal and accurate voice within our medical schools. Enthusiasm like this rubs off and I hope will generate a wave of new talent into primary care at a time of high demand but great opportunity for innovation. Being a GP is a great job but we do need more of us to make it as good as it can be.

Hi Alice and Nilakshini,
I understand that the UK is short of general practitioners. I am a dutch medical student in my final year and am thinking of becoming GP. I would like to experience what it is like in the UK(Bristol). Can you put me in touch with someone who will take me on for some weeks in the summer?

Palliative care in its broadest sense: Indian style
Posted by BJGP Life | 17 Oct 2019 | International, Opinion | 0
Philippa Jeacocke is an ST3 GP trainee in Sheffield. She has just returned from a year out of training, during which she worked in a variety of settings exploring her interests in refugee heath and palliative care.
Nandika has a huge, beaming smile. She smiles often and easily, and you find yourself smiling back in return. Before she was known to Pallium she lived in a makeshift tarpaulin shelter with her 13 year old son Harshad, sleeping on a mat on the ground and relying on the kindness of neighbours to bring them food. There was zero financial support; Nandika’s husband had left her several years ago because of her illness. Nandika relied on Harshad to draw up and inject her insulin because she was almost blind in both eyes due to cataracts, and the lack of any refrigeration meant the insulin sometimes overheated and degraded. When I first met her she had been without insulin for three days for this reason. Her walking is limited due to severe Charcot’s arthropathy and a deep ulcer on the base of her foot that has been chronically infected for the last four years, needing intermittent hospital admissions for intravenous antibiotics.
Nandika has type 1 diabetes and is 42 years old. She lives in Kerala in India, the country with the inauspicious title of having the most people with diabetes in any country in the world. It is also a country that has some of the world’s most prestigious international diabetes institutes, and yet situations like that of Nandika’s are not uncommon.
They champion a broad concept of palliative care, in many ways broader than that which we are familiar with in the West.
Pallium (https://palliumindia.org/) is a non-governmental organisation based in Trivandrum, Kerala and was founded by Dr Rajagopal, an anaesthetist by training. Its mandate is to provide and advocate for quality palliative care in Kerala and throughout India. They champion a broad concept of palliative care, in many ways broader than that which we are familiar with in the West, focussing on the relief of serious health-related suffering. This is in line with the recent international consensus definition which called on the WHO to update their own definition, to better encompass the needs of patients with complex chronic diseases, and crucially, to better reflect the challenges faced by low and middle-income countries where health professionals are often working without adequate resources or training1.
Trivandrum Institute of Palliative Science – the HQ of Pallium
In India, serious health-related suffering is tragically frequent, often as a result of severely limited access to opioid analgesia but also commonly due to complications that could have been prevented with earlier medical input or more consistent follow up. With these patients, as Dr Rajagopal explains, “the existing health system is not able to cater to their suffering” and as such, Pallium steps in. As a result, their patient population is diverse, including patients with advanced cancers, strokes and frailty, as well as those like Nandika, with complications of diabetes and vascular disease, and significant numbers with paraplegia or tetraplegia sustained following road traffic accidents or falls during coconut and banana tree harvesting.
A doctor in a primary health care centre catering to around 20-30,000 people will see between 100-300 patients a day.
Nandika’s story is a poignant illustrator of the many social and cultural barriers to accessing healthcare in India, in particular the often unaffordable out-of-pocket financial costs, and the social stigma experienced by people with illness and disability. A house, a fridge, and an income would likely have led to very different health outcomes for her and her son. It also highlights the importance of access to quality primary care to prevent complications of chronic disease, to help tackle socio-cultural barriers, and ultimately to reduce health inequalities. Kerala are doing better than other Indian states, but even so, a doctor in a primary health care centre catering to around 20-30,000 people will see between 100-300 patients a day. It is difficult, if not impossible, to imagine being able to provide quality care in such a setting.
In August I returned from my out of programme year to ST3 training in Sheffield. I now work within a skilful multidisciplinary team where health care assistants conduct pre-diabetes counselling, clinical pharmacists perform diabetic annual reviews and specialist foot care teams are just a phone call away. Despite our own pressing primary care crisis, my recent experience of healthcare in Kerala stands in stark contrast to provision in this country, and further accentuates the multiple systemic challenges that Pallium are battling on a daily basis.
Thanks to the dedicated work of Pallium, Nandika now has her own apartment with a fridge. Her vision has been dramatically improved following bilateral cataract surgeries, and a pair of glasses, which means she can administer her own insulin and Harshad can now attend school, significantly increasing his own life opportunities. Her glycaemic control is improving and she has ongoing foot and wound care with the input of a diabetic foot specialist.
These positive steps are a testament to the truly holistic palliative care provided by the team at Pallium, and I feel very privileged to have had the opportunity to work alongside colleagues who showed such compassionate commitment to their patients.

BJGP Open: adapting primary care for migrants
Posted by Euan Lawson | 16 Feb 2017 | BJGP Open, Bright Ideas and Innovation, Opinion, Research | 0
Photo by shawn at Morguefile.com
The aim of this paper was to provide some insight into how primary care is managing to offer care to migrants. In particular they were interested in looking at the challenges and the ways in which practices and practitioners were adapting to meet this need.
The first phase was an online survey. During this they surveyed 70 primary care practitioners. They then used responses to select eight case studies for a further qualitative phase. They had a mix of mainstream GP practices as well as specialist services that offered tailored services to refugees, asylum seekers and other migrants. There was one group interview (with three GPs from the same city) and seven further in-depth interviews. The descriptive analysis was structured around the principles of equitable care that drew on the framework from Browne et al.
They found that practitioners tended to focus on working with community and external agencies and adapted their own processes in order to avoid care. This was particularly evident in areas such as screening, vaccination, and health checks. The biggest barrier was the lack of funding and this was cited in 73% of cases. The organisation and partnerships were regarded as particularly important to ensure there is an awareness of wider social determinants, the impacts of trauma and violence, and all this had to be wrapped up into culturally-competent care.
Opinion: There is a small section in this paper that caught my eye in relation to burnout. Just over one-third (34%) cited personal fatigue/burnout/capacity as a barrier to developing services. The additional workload ramped up the stress for some healthcare professionals and in one of the services they had introduced life coaching. In another they had adopted debriefings that are similar to those used in conflict areas.
“I think in terms of values, everyone sees the work that we do in serving vulnerable groups as a privilege.”
I’d put a positive spin on the burnout angle – it can be enormously re-invigorating to get involved with marginalised groups. As one ‘mainstream’ GP stated: “I think in terms of values, everyone sees the work that we do in serving vulnerable groups as a privilege.”
There are some fine examples in this paper on how primary care can be developed to give a more “equity-oriented service”. It showcases how, despite all the appalling strain on the system, there are still ways for primary care to innovate to reduce health inequalities. More than anything we should be driven by the principle that we need to reduce health inequalities to improve our societies. And sometimes we need to hunt these people down. Whether it is people with learning disabilities, or the mentally ill, or people who inject drugs, the homeless or as in this case migrants and refugees – these are the groups of people that need our attention.

A BJGP Christmas Carol: Part Four
Posted by BJGP Life | 20 Dec 2018 | Stories | 0
Peter Aird is a GP in Bridgwater, Somerset.
This is part four of a five part series. If you can’t wait and like to binge read then you can download the full five part version for free as an epub or mobi file for use with your Kindle or other e-reader.
Stave Four – in which the future appears far from bright
Alone again, Scrooge, out of force of habit, checked his phone for notifications. No red circle had appeared in the corner of the Facebook icon to indicate that someone, somewhere, cared about what was on his mind. This was not unexpected as it had been a long time since anyone had ‘liked’ him – still longer since he’d been loved. It was a surprise to him, therefore, when the phone vibrated alerting him to the arrival of a text message.
‘This is to remind you that your appointment with the Ghost of General Practice Yet To Come is scheduled for now. Please access your QuickFix Health account and prepare to speak to somebody with no soul.’
Scrooge noticed a new app had appeared on his phone’s home screen. It glowed menacingly, demanding to be tapped. Against his better judgement, Scrooge opened the application and was greeted by a disclaimer making it clear that any advice given was only valid for minor, self limiting medical conditions and any harm that resulted from QuickFix clinicians failing to appreciate a more serious underlying problem was not their responsibility.
Those experiencing more complex health concerns were directed to approach less forward thinking health providers. Scrooge was requested to indicate his acceptance of these conditions and, having complied, the screen gave out a burst of light and there then appeared what looked for all the world to be a businessman dressed in an executive suit.
‘Welcome to QuickFix Health,’ the man announced, ‘where your health needs are our business opportunity.’ He smiled a self-satisfied smile, which Scrooge did not find reassuring.
‘Are you the Spirit of General Practice Yet To Come?’ Scrooge enquired.
The spirit’s smile wavered a little. ‘Is that what The Ghost of Christmas Present called me? She is so yesterday. I’ve been rebranded and, from now on, I am to be known simply as ‘The Future’. Exciting isn’t it? Now, how can I profit from you?’
‘I believe you’re supposed to show me my future.’
‘Yes of course, but I don’t have time to talk to you about that in any depth. So, in the interests of efficiency, I’d like to request that you utilise this corporate video feed. If you’ve any further questions you’ll be required to make a further appointment. You will receive an invoice for the services I have provided today and your account will be automatically debited the requisite amount. Thank you for using QuickFix Health. Have a nice day.’
Lost for words, Scrooge tapped the link that had appeared on his phone and continued to gaze at the screen at what seemed to be, if such a thing was possible, a broadcast from the future. It began with an aerial view of a huge featureless building over which an audio commentary played: ‘Welcome to the world’s first fast health outlet – where health is cheap and time is short.’
A notice board at the entrance of the building came into focus revealing that ‘The National Wellbeing Centre’ was open 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year. Two enormous panels straddled the entrance bearing images of the Secretary of State for Health and the President of the National Pharmaceutical Board. They were pictured smiling benignly down upon the multitude who were milling around a large reception area.
As the camera roamed around, the audio commentary explained how no appointment was necessary but that, on arrival, patients were required to utilise electronic panels positioned in the foyer to answer a series of questions by way of ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ answers only. As a result of the responses that were given, each individual would then be assigned to a wellbeing advisor. If, and only if, it was deemed necessary that face to face contact should ensue, they would then wait outside one of the 666 consulting rooms housed within the complex until their allocated interaction was scheduled.
Patients were advised that only objective quantifiable, symptoms could be dealt with and that treatment options would be determined solely on the basis of the medico-economic considerations pertinent to each individual case. Reassurances were offered that a number of payment options were available.
Around the foyer, electronic panels displayed information for consumers alongside a number of company disclaimers:
‘Due to many drugs now being of limited availability, if medication is advised, the sourcing of that medication is entirely the responsibility of the customer.’
‘Please be assured that we respect your anonymity and consider it of paramount importance to maintain the highest levels of confidentiality. In order to guarantee this, no wellbeing advisor will consult with the same client on more than one occasion and no personal communication is permitted between clinicians. A mask can be worn over the face if desired.’
‘The National Wellbeing Centre cannot accept responsibility.’
‘Strict quality control measures are in place to guarantee the optimal outcome of each clinical interaction. Each consultation is electronically monitored and any deviation from company protocols will result in disciplinary action being taken against the clinician concerned.’
The announcements seemed endless, each, it appeared to Scrooge, alienating the individual in need still further from the connection they craved with somebody who just might care enough to show a little concern. Patients were managed without any warmth or compassion – processed by a system that existed solely for the benefit the state that had created it.
As Scrooge continued to watch, the announcements kept flashing across the screens, hypnotising those whose eyes were drawn lifelessly to their incessant messages. Dehumanised, everyone became the same – and that same was nothing more than a reservoir of data.
‘Please be aware that displays of emotion are not encouraged in consultations and tissues are therefore not provided in the consultation rooms.’
‘Customers will not be permitted to leave the centre until the requisite post interaction forms are completed. Not only does the filling of these forms provide the essential feedback necessary to identify suboptimal clinician performance, the personal data requested allows us to identify those agencies from whom we will profit most by our facilitating their communication with you.’
‘Everybody here at the National Wellbeing Centre wishes you, and your purchases, a very merry Consumertide.’
And then, finally, before the cycle of messages started once more, one last announcement:
‘Turmeric is available from the kiosk in the foyer.’
The camera returned to a view of the outside of the building and Scrooge caught a glimpse of a small panel attached to the wall next to the main entrance. He paused the video and expanded the image to take a closer look. He could just make out the words that were inscribed on the ill-maintained copper plate.
‘This facility was erected on the derelict site of what was once known as a GP medical centre. Drs J. Marley and E. Scrooge worked here for many years providing a form of medical provision which today is only of historical interest. The medical centre operated with the quaint intent to provide medical care that was responsive to patient needs. Dr Marley’s untimely death left Dr Scrooge struggling as he found it impossible to replace his former partner.
He continued for a time supported by a series of doctors in training, but, after a personal tragedy struck the medical centre, it was no longer considered fit to remain a training practice. Dr Scrooge continued alone for a brief time, but the pressure of working in such an inefficient manner soon proved too much and he himself succumbed to a stress related illness. Happily, his demise proved the catalyst for the development of the progressive wellbeing centre that we benefit from today.’
Scrooge could not believe what he had witnessed. It struck him that there had at no point been any mention of there being any doctors present in the running of the well-being centre. It was almost as if there was now nobody providing a professional opinion, nobody making a judgement, nobody applying a bit of wisdom and that clinical algorithms were being used to make each and every decision.
Were there, he wondered, any doctors still in existence at all? Perhaps, in the future, nobody wanted to be one. The questions kept coming. Was this really the future of the health service that once, years previously, he had been so proud to be a part? What about Cratchit? What did the “personal tragedy” refer to? And what of his own future? Could any of this be changed?
Scrooge tapped frantically on his phone seeking a further appointment with the Ghost of General Practice Yet To Come. Fortunately, for all the faults of QuickFix Health, having made the appropriate additional payment, an appointment was easy to come by, and soon, the business-like figure of the spectre, who had been so brusque with him earlier, appeared on the screen once more.
‘Good Spirit,’ Scrooge implored, ‘Assure me that I may yet change these shadows you have shown me by an altered life.’
The spirit laughed. ‘It’ll take more than one doctor changing to alter the future of the health service. That’s the trouble with you people. Too often you think it’s all down to you’. The spirit made a poor attempt at a Clint Eastwood impersonation: ‘A doctor’s got to know his limitations.’
‘And besides, what’s your problem? What we’re doing merely reflects the ideology of the nation – that everything comes down to money. We measure and record data because data sells. What we understand at QuickFix Health is that people are commodities. For example, we record an elevated cholesterol solely because we know there is somebody out there who is selling a product to reduce lipid levels and is willing to pay for the information we collect. We don’t care about people, only the wealth that they generate for us.’
‘But it’s not all about money,’ Scrooge insisted.
‘Isn’t it?’ countered the spirit. ‘It seems to me that everyone has a price Dr Scrooge. Are you really the exception?’
‘Well maybe I do have a price, but if I have, it’s at least partly because, in recent years, with so much of the joy having been sucked out of the job, the only way that I’ve been in any way rewarded for my efforts is financially. There’s no appreciation from those who call the tune, no recognition of how difficult the job has become and nothing but constant demands that I must do better. Take appraisal – if a requirement to show year-on-year improvement doesn’t amount to saying that we’re not good enough as we are, I don’t know what is. Something has to change.’
‘Well good luck to you with that, Scrooge. I concede that, as a profession, challenging the status quo rather than capitulating to the spirit of the age whilst all the while laudably endeavouring to deliver its impossible demands would be a step in the right direction. But I can’t see it ever happening – you’re all too busy just trying to keep your head above water to organise a concerted campaign for change.’
‘But let me try, spirit. Let us try. I have learned my lesson well this night. Perhaps things need not turn out the way you have shown me.’
And with that, Scrooge deleted the QuickFix Health app from his phone, never to be installed again. He got back into bed. He’d seen and heard quite enough.

BJGP Long Read: Healthcare’s hole in the heart
Posted by BJGP Life | 19 Nov 2019 | BJGP Long Read | 0
David Zigmond was a small practice GP in south London 1977-2016. Read Obituary for St James Church Surgery: the death of a practice.
Can we have value for money and not lose our humanity?
Our lives lengthen, our population increases, our expectations multiply: inevitably our healthcare services need ever more resources, monitoring and coordination. Efficiency becomes crucial. Increasingly, management methods from competitive production industries have been adopted to meet these needs. Yet the results are often paradoxical and demotivating. Why is that?
In a full heart there is room for everything, in an empty heart there is room for nothing.
– Antonio Porchia, Voces, 1968
The NHS culture I have retired from has departed far from the one that tended and guided me several decades ago, at the beginning of my life as a doctor.
My working milieu has evolved a curiously unhappy amalgam: fatigued and demoralised, yet edgy and mistrustfully vigilant. This is manifest by a workforce subject to ever-increasing pressures by, and for, ‘management’: goals and targets, deadlines, directives, performance indicators, appraisals, inspections and audits.
While ever more public funds and resources are ring-fenced for healthcare, the morale of its servants continues to plummet.
Such executive devices have, perversely, caused the loss of the very human satisfactions that make our difficult work worthwhile: personally invested relationships with both colleagues and patients, the flexibility and time spans that enable our most human types of holism – the ability to both perceive and mould how this particular diagnosis or intervention relates to this particular life and its relationships.
The losses of such personal meaning and gratification in our NHS workforce causes widespread destruction. This is reflected in many statistics: rates of sickness, career abandonment, intraorganisational litigation, earliest retirement, drug and alcohol abuse, suicide – all these have markedly increased.
Mostly undocumented, but very telling, is the growing discrepancy between the privately uttered and the publicly avowed: what is disclosed in quiet sequestered conversations is very different to the vaunted presentation in the conference room or official document. I am told that such fearful and hidden dissonance and loss of integrity premonitored the cynical and exhausted collapse of the Soviet Union.
All of these morbid signs have been generated, then accelerated, in the last two decades. This has happened usually because of serial service redesigns, hardly ever in spite of them. While ever more public funds and resources are ring-fenced for healthcare, the morale of its servants continues to plummet: at the heart of our Welfare we seem to have created a kind of human black hole.
Yet we have learned to revere our health service as a kind of Welfare Crown Jewel. Politicians of all hues understandably want quick and decisive reversals to any sign of degradation: the motivations are usually mixtures of public interest and anxiety about their job tenure. Their public statements are, therefore, designed to sound resolute, muscular and galvanic. ‘Driving up standards’ is a standard and safe mantra; ‘Declaring all-out war on mediocrity’ seems more desperate and courts the absurd. Both were stated by Cabinet Ministers.
Both of the phrases are worth some analysis: they are good examples of how we may exacerbate problems by simplistic judgements or plans.
First, ‘the war on mediocrity’. What can this mean? The mediocre is an average, so how would we identify it as an opposition force? Then how do we eliminate it without another ‘mediocrity’ arising? The rhetoric has much bluster, but little sense. ‘Driving up standards’ may seem more cogent but induces many problems. We talk about ‘driving’ cattle, chemical processes or motor vehicles: it is a phrase that implies dominance and control, and thus complete submission of the driven. This brings us to the crux of a very important question, one central to the motivational psychology, and then management, of our welfare services: what is the best way to get other people to care for yet more other people?
Operationally, do we need more sticks and carrots? Why does this not work better? Is there something we are missing? Is it trust?
***
Our best welfare is not like a manufactured chemical process; it is much more like a child, or at least a complex living tissue. In both of these survival, then sustainable growth, need a protected environment and nurture quite as much as any control. Expecting good welfare to evolve and thrive in an oppressively controlled working environment is like expecting a happy and creative individual to emerge from a family that is determined by many inflexible rules – it rarely happens.
Yet this is what we have set up in our welfare services. Our advanced industrial culture is now so accustomed to being able to design and manufacture objects that service our wishes, that we assume we can do the same with our complex human needs and interactions. Often we have been able to short-circuit complex natural processes. Sometimes this has been expediently successful, but cumulatively it has led to any ‘family’ ethos of Welfare being commandeered as a kind of factory process. What does this mean? Here are two scenarios, separated by forty years, to illustrate and explain.
***
1972. Frank’s Flower Bed. Mental Hospital. Outer London.
As a young psychiatrist I worked in a large and handsomely stalwart Victorian building set amidst extensive, landscaped and well-tended grounds. It had a staff canteen – a cheerfully clamorous space offering unpretentious, good-enough, home-cooked food and the opportunity for easy and informal colleagueial contact. Several times there I opportunistically lunched and talked with Frank, the Hospital Administrator. Frank was about thirty years older than me, with an unintrusively warm and avuncular manner. He liked, when possible, to talk to staff members and (those that wanted to) patients.
I remember occasionally continuing our conversations beyond the canteen, sauntering along the paths connecting the many lawns, flower beds, massed rhododendrons and azaleas. Tending these were small groups of patients to whom – the longer-term ones – Frank signalled a friendly recognition. Frank and I were interested in one another’s roles and perspectives. He told me how he had started working at this hospital as an eighteen-year-old wages clerk. He had slowly ‘worked his way up’.
Frank was interested my young, questioning, ‘freshman’s’ view of his long-served job and ancient institution. I described my experience of working in this large, sequestered working community as like being in a village, in which he was the Mayor. He smiled with cautious pride. ‘Yes’, he said, ‘I suppose it is that kind of community. Well, I hope it’s mostly a welcoming village for you to work in, and that I’m a worthy Mayor’.
Frank’s tender planting was a small act from a large heart and mind: an investment that could take root.
My last image of Frank was unusual and it remains sharp in my memory. At the front of the hospital was a rather grand porticoed entrance. This itself was symmetrically flanked by a few parking spaces for staff beyond which there was a small, lawned roundabout with a central flower bed. Having finished work late one midsummer evening I saw an incongruous crouched figure, indistinct in the fading light. It was Frank planting a flowering shrub. My understanding lagged behind my greeting.
‘Oh! Frank … What are you doing?’ I asked with friendly perplexity.
Frank firmed and patted the last of the anchoring soil and looked up.
‘I thought this would bring a bit of life and colour to this rather neglected flower bed,’ he explained, glancing briefly with affection at the shrub.
‘When it blossoms you’ll see it from your office window.’ I wanted him to receive some of his own beneficence.
‘Yes…’ he looked around ‘a lot of people will see it… ‘. He paused and exhaled a soft, low sigh of satisfied completion and anticipation. ‘I hope a lot of people will still see it well after I’m gone, too…’
His smile seemed poignant and intimate: an inexplicit intimation of our universal mortality.
***
I had always liked Frank’s unegotistical and humble personal pride in his work, which he enacted with such unassuming but steadfast public service: that was why I liked to walk and talk with him. Even at the time of this affecting yet brief encounter and dialogue, I realised it captured something subtle and precious with a poetic economy. Frank’s tender planting was a small act from a large heart and mind: an investment that could take root and enhance not only his life, but others’ and other times. As far as I know, Frank’s working life was long, stable and otherwise unremarkable. He received little public recognition.
He was called an Administrator.

2015. Brenda’s Business Support. Frontline General Practice. Inner London.
It is now four years into the Health and Social Care Act. This legislation was introduced stealthily, amidst much confusion: it was implemented (just) with assurances that it would free GPs from the growing bureaucratic mire and so empower them to make speedy and accurate decisions for the patients and localities that they supposedly know well. This last notion is a serious misconception, as GPs have largely lost their special vantage point for personal and vernacular knowledge.
GPs are now discovering just how complex are decisions of public healthcare policy… and how different these are to the skills of doctor-patient encounters.
More broadly this is contributing to an unleashing of the Law of Unintended Consequences whose effects are far more durable than the political and rhetorical slogans that spawned them. GPs are now discovering just how complex are decisions of public healthcare policy and administration, and how different (however connected) these are to the skills of doctor-patient encounters.
Frustrations about the demands of the massive new tasks are very substantial. Even worse is the way that doctors are further depleted of their already dwindling head and heart-space: the intellectual and emotional opportunities for personally invested and gratifying work with patients. Instead, their vocational energies are officiously abducted into conduits to serve a public utility.
These initiatives – turning all professional activity, interchange and mental life into publicly managed commodities – have inadvertently displaced, and then destroyed, the powerful yet subtle personal nuances that are the vitalising human heart of our personal healthcare.
***
Alarms are being raised about this, but no-one seems to be able to stem the rising tide of bureaucratic directives and incentives – the floodwater drowning us with such a massive volume of depersonalised stress and exhaustion.
Over many years I have issued dozens of invitations to managers and politicians to sit in with me, in a surgery session. We could then share, in vivo, experiences and notions directly from the front-line. My invitations have never been taken up. Often the declination has been explained by other ‘more essential’ meetings and commitments. Even if veracious, there is another never articulated truth: ‘We cannot deal with real experiences; we can only process abstracted representations of these.’ This is the thin end of an important wedge: one often signalling the nemesis of all those taking responsibility for others.
Ignoring such signs and alarms seems perilous to me. I repeatedly try to raise this at our professional (Clinical Commissioning Group) meetings: each time I am told that the Agenda is already full of essential administrative matters, and that these meetings, in any case, are an incorrect forum for my concerns. I ask where and when can we publicly discuss such crucial and perverse discrepancies? I receive no answer. Yet I am receiving some dark encouragement: for at other times colleagues seek me out in private spaces to express their hidden frustration, resentment and fear: the broken life energies behind the bad statistics.
***
In an effort to assure open discussion I continue my efforts to contact a manager. They, surely, can ensure that this is put on an Agenda. This is proving tricky. If emails are answered it is with officially phrased dissemblance or procrastination. More often they lie unattended in a cyberdump.
Personal conversations are required. I telephone the relevant manager but cannot get through: I leave messages with assistants and an answerphone. I persist.
On my last attempt I am put through to a voice that sounds to me clipped, correct and uninterested in involving herself in anything she cannot authoritatively answer. However, she responds confidently to my questions of designation: she is a Business Support Manager and her name is Brenda. I ask what her role entails and her reply seems stiff with bureaucratese: ‘corporate strategy’, ‘integration of multidisciplinary planning’, ‘interface communication between Trusts in Commissioning implementations’… Her voice has the sing-song cadence of an official on autopilot. My attention soon drifts away.
I am thinking how distant are the worlds that Brenda and I inhabit. The welfare work I have been doing for many years is very different from what she calls a ‘business’. And who is she ‘supporting’? I can imagine her ‘supporting’ some commissioning or auditing initiative … I cannot imagine her supporting me.
‘How can I help you?’ Brenda cuts across my disengaged reverie with a brusquely managerial tone.
I briefly explain what I want to put on our meeting’s agenda: the collapse of NHS staff morale and rise of staff sickness and career abandonment.
Her voice cools further to a crystalline formality. ‘I’m not, strictly speaking, the right manager for you to speak to. I’ll pass your message on. Somebody will get back to you.’
***
Three weeks later. Nobody has.
Who does Brenda support?
While I am pondering these questions, my mind is crossed by another, tragicomic, notion: how I would rather be a junior shrub in Frank’s flower-bed than a senior doctor in Brenda’s business-supported NHS

It is not because other people are dead that our affection for them grows faint, it is because we ourselves are dying.

BJGP Long Read: A valedictory note on my retirement
Posted by BJGP Life | 21 Feb 2020 | BJGP Long Read | 18
Claire Stillman is a recently retired GP who spent 30 years in Scottish general practice, the last 20 of which were in Glasgow.
About eight months ago I wrote an emotional, angry rant about why I was leaving general practice. It was in response to a questionnaire from the LMC asking me for reasons why I was going. I never sent it to them; it seemed enough to write everything down and it exhausted my anger. I kept meaning to go back to it but I never did, probably because it was too upsetting when I was in work and then it became irrelevant when I left. My emotion had been expended. Also, I felt that I had said nothing new. There were no blinding insights, other people had said the same things over and over and nothing had changed. It is hard to see how anything can change given the current structure and funding of the NHS. I should say that I took early retirement at the age of 59 following 30 years in General Practice and I might have taken a handful of days of sick leave in that time. I never took any time off for stress.
Here are the reasons I left, or perhaps some of them:
Appointments
The appointment system is not fit for purpose. A GP has to be all things to all people in 10 minutes only and this is untenable. In this time we have to deal with the polypharmacised multiply morbid patient who has several problems to discuss. We have to manage an increasing amount of clinical work transferred from secondary to primary care. We have to deal with the manipulative, the dangerous and the deluded. We have to deal with those with shopping lists of demands, the worried well, those sent by third parties for proof of just about anything. We have to deal with the longwinded, the demented, the unhappy, the angry. We have to deal with the worried parent and the sick child. We have to deal with the medical emergency or those who think it is an emergency. The list goes on. We are accessible to everyone, every single being has the right to walk in to discuss anything; there is no filter, no prior discussion to see whether a trip to a GP is appropriate or suitable.
We pay an emotional price for constant availability for everything the world throws at us.
GPs can be bullied and manipulated by a public who increasingly demand certainty and rights and a bureaucracy that seeks to medicalise social problems. In all this we have no support. We were trained to help others’ suffering, not manage our own. We pay an emotional price for constant availability for everything the world throws at us (and I mean everything), and a professionalism that is never acknowledged or meaningfully supported. We face the relentless expectations of the ten minute appointment, the constantly full waiting rooms, the unacceptable waiting times to be seen and feel constantly punished because we cannot meet them. I can honestly say that in all my time as a GP principle, I can count on one hand the times I did not have a fully booked surgery. Government policy, patient expectation, pressure on our staff mean that we are constantly in the wrong, on the back foot, for not delivering a service that, quite frankly, is impossible to provide. We are supposed to be made of teflon, have no feelings, cope with the relentless daily, monthly, yearly pressure of not delivering the impossibly perfect service that this society believes is their right.
Patient expectations
Expectations by patients have changed over my thirty years in practice. Society has changed; the consumer approach, the belief that everything should have an answer, the inability to accept the uncertainty of life and health; the belief that if something goes wrong someone must be to blame have all increased over time. Expectations increasingly fuelled by the unrealistic claims made on the internet. Also the idea that everyone should have instant access, instant answers, has grown. These expectations are not really compatible with what GPs do, namely manage uncertainty. Because of this GPs have been harried into increasing amounts of patient tests, often with no clear goal in mind and no evidence that it would be useful. On the contrary, tests breed insecurity and more tests, because doctors feel the need to cover themselves, to insure themselves against patients demanding ever more certainty. It is ironic that in an age when the population has never been more healthy or long lived, health uncertainty and anxiety increases. Adding to patient expectations is the medicalisation of human sadness. The belief that a doctor can make grief, sadness, the ordinary difficulties of life better with a pill or therapy seems to have increased steadily over the years.
Lack of resources
Mental health services were reason enough to leave general practice.
GPs are damned if they do and damned if they don’t. We are placed in impossible double binds by chronic NHS underfunding and then blamed for the outcomes. Classic examples are the exploitation of our gate keeping roles by saying we must refer less into secondary care and then blaming us for not diagnosing enough cancers. We are held responsible for not diagnosing the rarest of cancers, which have no characteristic sets of symptoms, and yet demonised or refused by secondary care if we refer patients like these in.
Mental health services were reason enough to leave general practice. The NHS in my area refused to fund or possibly organise an even half functioning service and given society’s propensity for medicalising any adverse human experience we were imprisoned in the ultimate double bind and for us it was a life sentence. Throughout my entire career I was supposed to deal with the mentally distressed in ten minute appointments with no credible back up. The media slammed us for handing out too many antidepressants giving the impression that we had any alternatives. Trust me, we did not. The stark choices for GPs dealing with mental distress ranging from overt psychosis to a little sadness were a prescription for a pill then and there and a bit more than ten minutes (thereby pressurising everyone else in the waiting room), or a referral for a mental health treatment, be it talking therapy or more assessment which might occur within the next 3 to 6 months. The icing on the cake was that despite a GP referral, the mental health service might decide, several weeks later, not to offer any treatment at all. Truly GPs backs are up against the wall when dealing with mental health problems, which on a conservative estimate, take up to 20% of their work. Indeed, there is a psychological component to all disease. Dealing with mental health services throughout my career was the most excruciating and depressing aspect of my job.
Another problem caused by underfunding, which inexorably worsened throughout my time in practice, was waiting times. This has caused the NHS to become cruel in its dealing with suffering patients. I have seen people with severe, debilitating, painful conditions having to wait up to a year to be seen in secondary care. And then they get sent for tests, have to wait months for their results, and then they have to wait further months for follow up in clinics to get the results of said tests. Hospital doctors never make decisions without panels of tests that seem to grow larger by the year. Meanwhile the GP is the only doctor a patient can directly access while waiting for all these events, the walls are very high around secondary care, and we are expected to manage their pain, anxiety and frustration with no power to change anything. As usual, there is no support for the GP managing the patient in this vacuum and the more compassionate the GP, the more likely they are to be broken by this powerlessness in the face of suffering.
Complexity
Patients are becoming increasingly complex. They live longer, are on more medication and often have two, three or even more co-existing conditions. We are expected to deal with their needs in ten minutes, or consider their problems in the little time we have between fire-fighting paperwork and results and managing the practice. Meanwhile secondary care is becoming more specialised with increasing numbers of silos. A patient goes to a hospital clinic where a specialist has the luxury of dealing with one condition only, with all the back up of a hospital department. And it can happen that the decision a specialist makes about the one condition that is their remit will have a knock on effect for the other conditions a patient might have. It is left to the GP to sort it out. A record achieved by one of my patients was that he visited seven different specialties on a regular basis, all of which dealt with one aspect of his care and none of which could come up with an overarching explanation for his symptoms. Needless to say I had ten minutes to deal with all of them. The use of protocols, guidelines and non-doctor vetting of secondary care referrals also lead to GP stress, not to say cruelty to the patient. The silos are getting narrower, secondary care clinicians are more and more empowered to say what they will not deal with . Meanwhile GPs have to deal with their rejections with no support for their suffering patients.
Polypharmacy
This is a real problem in the ten minute appointment. All evidence based medicine derives from studies on single conditions and all medication guidelines come from them. The problem is that very few patients have only one condition. The GP has to juggle co-prescribed medications with their multiplicity of interactions and side effects in each individual, very difficult in a busy surgery with a waiting room full of patients expecting to be seen on time. Ironically when the community pharmacists started to be involved in the Scottish NHS new contract, they stated they would need thirty minutes per patient. And a pharmacist would only be dealing with medications while the GP has to deal with the actual patient’s agenda, which may be something else entirely. Prescribing outwith the consultation has also become more onerous over the last few years as drug shortages and the increasing prescribing demands of secondary care have to be managed.
Poorly understood conditions/somatisation/chronic pain
Some of the hardest patients to deal with, the most time consuming and emotionally draining, are the ones that don’t fit into neat diagnostic boxes, yet constantly present with suffering and demand answers. These patients are not recognised by, and certainly not treated by secondary care. For example, those people with chronic pain for which we actually have no effective medication. Synthetic opiates, the only treatment out there, do not work and turn them into addicts. Any attempts at psychological reframing of their conditions are seriously resisted by the patients, and to be frank, the medical establishment.
There seems to be a belief that GP is elastic can continuously absorb extra work indefinitely.
The Cartesian dualism that bedevils our concepts of illness means that patients and many doctors think that the ultimate insult is to suggest that their suffering is ‘all in their head’ and for some strange reason does not then exist. Unfortunately GPs are faced with a number of patients who manifest their life distress with physical symptoms, call it somatisation for want of a better term, for whom existing medicine has no treatment and who become bitterly entrenched in their illness behaviour as they feel less and less cared for. The ‘fibromyalgics’, the chronically fatigued, for whom there is no realistic therapy and for which GPs have no training or support. I am not surprised that so many of them turn to snake oil salesman and quacks who at least provide them with attention before exploiting their vulnerabilities.
Outsourcing of secondary care work
Over the years, general practice has been subjected to a form of ‘mission creep’ with secondary care demanding that we increasingly do work that was originally done in hospital medicine. While it may seem reasonable that GPs manage new atrial fibrillation or perform near patient testing, this is added to our already increasing workload. There seems to be a belief that GP is elastic can continuously absorb extra work indefinitely. There is only so much work that we can take before we break.
Housebound patients
While home visit rates have gone down, housebound patients are becoming increasingly complex so that visits can resemble ward rounds in a geriatric hospital. Patients are often on medications and have conditions that need frequent monitoring and repeat visits that we are not resourced to manage. Latterly, I became increasingly concerned about our cohort of usually elderly, frail housebound patients on complex, potentially dangerous treatment regimes who were poorly managed in the community. General practice as it stands is just not equipped to deal with these people.
Conclusion
I think the chief thing to emphasise is that GPs stand alone, and are chronically under resourced. We may work in group practices and have our administration staff, but once the door is closed, it is just the GP and the patient in the room together. And in real time we have no support, indeed we have no formal support networks at all on the ground. There is no-one to catch us as we fall, we have no protection from the ire of the public, anger that is usually caused by a system that fails to deliver what has been promised. We stand and fall by the decisions we make in ten minutes and if things go wrong, the full weight of public and professional opprobrium lands on our heads. There is no safety net, no cavalry coming over the hill to relieve us.
Now, I have retired and I do not miss any of it. I was well thought of by my patients and staff to judge by the feedback I have received over the years and the overwhelming number of cards and presents I received when I retired. I also got on with and liked my partners. Yet a powerful emotion I associate with my time in general practice was one of failure. I had failed to deliver a good service and so now I am just relieved to be free of it. However, what does bother me is that I had a wealth of knowledge and skills, accumulated over lifetime, which I will never use again.
Yet there is no place for me now in my profession, general practice has lost my skills and those of all my retired peers completely.
And what does strike me is that perhaps my profession could benefit from my and my peers’ experience. I could perhaps mentor younger GPs, newly practising partners, and provide them with the support I never had. I can read a face, interpret its subtle movements, be aware of another’s suffering. I can listen actively and frame peoples’ stories empathetically and positively. I can pull out the essential points in a narrative, summarise a conversation, help someone form a plan for the future. I can listen. Yet there is no place for me now in my profession, general practice has lost my skills and those of all my retired peers completely. I feel that this is a shame as we are a resource that could be utilised for the good of the profession.
As for the future of general practice, I do not trust the Scottish NHS and the health boards to deliver the supposed new Scottish GP contract. They mouth platitudes but follow their own agendas rather than those of general practice, they have not trusted GPs to execute the changes and allocated funds seem to have dissipated in a plethora of talking shops and committees. It seems that the further you remove practitioners, the people who actually do the work, from decisions about how the work is done, the less successful the outcome. Unfortunately, GPs have been so busy actually doing their jobs, they have not had the time or emotional energy to fight for a new contract that works for them. I have little hope that the new contract will result in better experiences for patients or their doctors.
However, it can be argued that innovation, out of the box thinking comes from those without an interest in the system, so let’s throw the problem of how to run an NHS out there. Let all and sundry chew on it, because I don’t expect those within the system to come up with any answers. Lets hope someone has thought of something before the inevitable happens to me and I become a patient.

Thank you so very much for putting my sentiments down in such an eloquent way. I left my partnership in Glasgow recently aged 55 for the reasons you have outilined. I waited for the new contract and knew it was inadequate and resigned my partnership.
“the more compassionate the GP, the more likely they are to be broken by this powerlessness in the face of suffering”- this especially very much summed up my experience.
I now locum and feel more protected and distanced from the toxic work conditions expected of me by myself, patients, the NHS and the SG. I feel my experience of 30years as a doctor is wasted and I just have to suck it up and not dwell on it. That’s life! A shame when there is so much capacity of compassion and skill to give to people, given the right conditions.

Hi, given the current situation, perhaps we should view Active GP as something that you do for a finite time only, as part of a “portfolio career “ not a whole working lifetime. Rather you spend sometime at the frontline, then move onto less stressful jobs having done your bit. The question would be what to move on to that we have the skills and training for, apart from locum work. Also I think most people would agree that the more experienced the doctor the better practitioner they are. Always remembering that experience can just mean making the same mistakes with increasing confidence!

I also took early retirement from GP Partnership at 56 and have not regretted it. As I walked out of my surgery for the last time I almost literally felt a weight lifted from my shoulders. I share the author’s regret that I can’t continue to use the wisdom and experience gained over 30 years to help patients and relieve some of the burden from my younger colleagues.

Wow. Thank you for a brilliant, honest piece. I’m relatively early in my GP career and I recognise ALL of what you say. At the moment, the good outweighs the bad for me in GP, but I do wonder if I have the resilience to stay the distance. The lesson for me is: look after yourself and each other, because everyone else will milk you as dry as you let them.
I have saved this article for future reference and sharing. Thank you again.

I also took early retirement at 59 now nearly 7 years ago. This article describes my feelings too (OK in England not Scotland). I feel too that stopping work lifted a burden from me and regret at never being able to do the job to the best of my ability due to constant time pressure. The skills I gained in listening to my patients for over 30 years are no longer available to the NHS, as new less experienced doctors are assumed to be of equal value to the NHS. Bums on seats can be counted and that’s what appears to matter to those counting and making the rules.

Thanks for all your comments. Perhaps the RCGP should consider the mentoring idea! I refer to the comment I made above about limited stints at the front line. Sadly, in Scotland there is a shortage of new GPS and practices have had to shut up shop because of this. Clare

Clair, your comments eloquently outline the challenges and unreasonable demands placed on GP’s and 5 years ago I faced the same dilemma in my English practice of 30 years, and at 58 I too decided it was time to leave. I then decided to tackle a different challenge and moved to a much smaller remote and rural practice in the Hebrides as an NHS salaried partner. Surgeries and lists became smaller and I now have the luxury of time to spend with the patients and have the support of fabulous community staff. The experience and knowledge I’ve accumulated has been well used and I’ve truly enjoyed this final phase of my medical career, and I’m still working here
5 years later!
We are privileged to have the job we do, but time pressures can certainly prevent us giving our patients the service they deserve.

What a brilliantly written article. Comprehensively details why GP is failing and will likely not exist, at least in its current format, in the next 10-15 years. GP is the Walmart of medicine, pile them in, stack them high – all you can fit, anything and everything in a 10min appt. It is popular with politicians as they need cheap medicine by GPs to subsidise the expensive specialists and keep the tax payers happy with lower tax rates.
Unfortunately the real world is not like the Dr Who Tardis and time does not expand. GPs are human and to remain humane, we need to self care to avoid burnout. For some it will be time to boundary patients, for others it will be time to cut back on sessions and and for many it is time to look for alternative careers. I used to look at GPs as a child in the 1980s with deep respect and awe, they had status and commanded respect from their peers. These times no longer exist. Now each day is a battle for many if not most. I left the NHS year ago and will not return, I wish those of you who remain the best.

This has been one of the best short reads describing what GP life has become and I can’t disagree with any of it. Strange thing is, like the Gp reply above, who moved to a small rural practice , and enjoying his last 5 years, I too have honestly rarely ever had a bad day in my 30 years as a GP partner now aged 58 Wales. Small personalised list 2750 (weighted list 3500) in a 2 person (1.5fte) so 4 day week. The single biggest reason I remain happy and peaceful in the midst of the plethora of issues you so eloquently describe is for me they all become so much milder/manageable/solvable when there is someone who armed with a life time knowledge of their small 1300-1500 patients characters, expectations and illnesses, finds decisions and tests ,mail and the whole lot becomes quicker easier, more thorough.Its not that I am not busy ,it’s just not always busy. It’s not that I am better as I am not.
From what I see and hear in the profession generally, I can’t see a sustainable way forward for Primary care unless we rapidly move to personalised lists, yes in group partnerships supported by HCSW/Nurses/PA/admin . I mean where you are solely responsible for your own patients, not someone else’s,not strangers,not patients who try and manipulate new GPs. Yes seek 2nd opinions occasionally, Expect yes a day off each week where similar partner /colleagues cover any emergencies.No long waits to be seen . Telephone first less necessary, “Rubbish“ I hear some think,but I maintain it is all very possible because my experience is the time saving and in depth supervision by one GP of an almost totally “known” population really does yield the time and space to let us cope,grow and even thrive.
Most complex illnesses become less stressful as you have been with them through it all and know them almost as well as they do. Your previous consultation laid out the actions you would do if they returned. Ten minutes often plenty bar the first new complex illness, no more long history taking by talented GPs who have little knowledge of the patient multiplied a thousand times a year .Less mental stress and clinician anxiety.
Add in HCSW, social Prescribing and decent mental health services and it become a real pleasure and something even at 58 I don’t wish to give up.
Planning 2 days a week till 65.
You asked for a solution. There it is. Not meant to be Patronising. Personalised lists where you and only you ,95% of the time have to make the decisions that will affect your workplace tomorrow and next week Is the way ahead. .Claire, please don’t stay away, seek a small practice as you are incredibly valuable. As for me I am planning 2 days a week till 65.

I am a 50 year old GP working in North West England. I could not agree more with everything that is written in this article. I am a very robust individual and continue to work as a Partner in a large practice with great colleagues. However I have seen many very good people “broken” (alcoholism, Depression, burn out) by the toxic environment of General Practice.Good UK GPs are some of the finest and hard working General Physicians in the world. In the last 10 years I have come to the conclusion that the NHS is not fit for purpose in the current world and never will be. The sooner the NHS becomes a private insurance based service then the sooner GPs will be able to control their workload / quality of care and lead a full rewarding working life that does not “break them”.

Clair, what a beautifully written article.
Thank you.
Last year I initiated the project “Rediscover the Joy of General Practice” https://www.srmc.scot.nhs.uk/joy-project/
It is specifically designed for GPs like you coming up for retirement but who feel they have more to give, but not under the pressures you describe.
It began as a collaboration between NHS Orkney, Shetland, Western Isles and Highland and this year has expanded to include other Scottish Health Boards.
It is based on work undertaken in Orkney over the last 10 years.
We offer contracts of between 6-18+ weeks/year to undertake practice attachments for periods of 1-4 weeks at a time. Travel from a Scottish city and accommodation is paid for, meaning that GPs do not need to relocate.
Our philosophy is based on supporting the practices and staff in all aspects of GP work and quality improvement.
Have a look at the website to understand the scheme more fully.
In 2019 we recruited 33 GPs to our Rural GP Support Team, many were retiring GPs who have felt reinvigorated by working with us.
This year we have expanded the scheme to involve the whole of Scotland and not just rural practices.
Currently we have shortlisted a further 35 GPs.
Although we have officially closed, we will still accept late applications and will reopen to applications again once we have established this second team.
What is interesting is that as our team expands and develops we suddenly find that we have the opportunity to consider how we can tackle what previously seemed intractable problems.
All members of the team are encouraged to contribute their ideas of how we could tackle thorny issues and due to the phenomenal depth of experience and expertise among our GPs we find ourselves in an unusually empowered position.
The project is led by the Primary Care Associate Medical Directors and Managers from the participating Health Boards and has the full backing of the Scottish Government.
We are at an early stage and certainly do not have all the answers, but we are determined to try and make a difference.
Working together with vision, determination and lateral thinking I believe we can make real changes – however, I am a self-confessed irresponsible optimist!
Anyone interested, do have a look at the website and please feel free to join us.
Claire, I would very much like to have a chat with you and to explore some of your ideas.

Destination GP: How to help medical students become GPs
Posted by BJGP Life | 13 Dec 2017 | Undergraduate | 1
Written by Fisher D, Bull C, Blackadder-Weinstein J, Nicholls G, Hawthorne K.
Becoming a GP should be a highly sought-after medical speciality destination. As a career, general practice can be both flexible and diverse – with new models of care developing both in multi-disciplinary teams and ‘at scale’, opportunities in research, teaching, portfolio working and clinical extended roles. Expert generalist skills are based on holistic assessments of often undifferentiated and complex presentations, making diagnosis, management and co-production with patients intellectually challenging. So why are many medical students and newly qualified doctors being put-off choosing it as their speciality? Why are GP training places going unfilled?[1]
Destination GP based on a survey of UK medical students, published by the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Medical Schools Council, has shown that a key deterrent to choosing general practice as a career is likely to be caused by negativity towards general practice from academics, clinicians and/or other educational trainers. In total, 3680 students (9.4% of the total) across 30 medical schools responded, and 76% of these reported experiencing negative comments or attitudes towards general practice.
91% of respondents believed their peers had negative views about general practice.
Overall, 39% of students said that tutors from other specialities had put them off working in general practice, and 70% of final year students reported experiencing negativity towards general practice in a clinical environment. Only 3% of medical students said they thought general practice was intellectually challenging. Given that 91% of respondents believed their peers had negative views about general practice and 35% saw their peers as one of the most influential determinants of their views on general practice, helping students to build a clear and positive perspective early on in their medical training is essential. The current pressures and high workload of GPs are not going unnoticed by future doctors, with 72% of students perceiving negativity about general practice within the current political environment and in the media.
While knowledge about these issues has been published before,[2] [3] this is the first representative survey of medical students across the UK to produce significant evidence that denigration is widespread. However, the survey also found that GP advocates have real potential to deliver positive and impactful messages to students, and that experiences from GP placements can have a profound influence on student career choices. In the survey, 81% of students reported that GPs on placements had most influenced their perceptions of general practice. Academic GP tutors and medical school GP Societies also have an important role to play here. Four in ten (41%) students said their interaction with a GP Society had a positive influence on their interest in general practice, and 71% said that their academic GP tutors had made them more interested in becoming GPs.
The academic research basis of general practice is an important aspect of its intellectual appeal.
Giving these advocates more support is essential. The full-costs of student placements in general practice are not currently being met and practices receive substantially less for placements than in secondary care, despite costs being very similar. This must be corrected, to allow more practices to offer high-quality clinical placements, and give students opportunities from early in their training to meet positive role models for general practice. The academic research basis of general practice is an important aspect of its intellectual appeal but students need signposting to academic general practice within undergraduate curricula.
Destination GP sets out a series of recommendations to tackle these issues, and suggests that while the challenges may be daunting, there is much that can be done. The power of peer and role models needs to be fully appreciated, and the discourse that unthinkingly puts students off careers in general practice needs to change. Students need an accurate and informed picture of the current and future general practice landscape. Given the shortfall of GPs across the UK, and with worrying signs of an ongoing drop in numbers, taking urgent action is ever more important for the survival of general practice, and with it, the future of our healthcare service.

I think that FY2 posts in GP are even more powerful than undergraduate placements in enticing prospective GP’s.
It was feeling like I ‘fitted in’ during my FY2 post that led me to apply for GP Training.

GP in crisis: how does European family medicine compare?
Posted by BJGP Life | 27 Oct 2015 | Clinical, International, Opinion, Political | 7
Mary McCarthy is a GP in Shrewsbury., She is on the GPC and is interested in comparative health systems. She is the BMA rep to UEMO.
UEMO (Union Européenne des Médecins Omnipraticiens) represents GPs in 26 European member states. It develops policy and projects to support family medicine and to share best practice. It also provides an opportunity to look at other health systems and to learn from them, studying alternative ways of working and investigating ideas that may help with UK general practice.
Earlier this year, a questionnaire was circulated by the UK delegation that asked about workload pressures in the differing EU member states. A total of 25 states replied (Malta gave two answers for their public and their private health care systems) and although the data set is incomplete, it still makes interesting reading and an overview of the findings is presented here.
Different models, different responsibilities
Not all countries have registered lists of patients. Often it divides, as it does in the Irish Republic, into those that are covered by a means-tested state-led system who have to be registered to take advantage of the financial benefits, and those who pay privately for health care, either through an insurance-based system or through their own pocket.
Sometimes, as in France, there is no requirement to register but because insurance companies offer incentives, 90% of patients do.
In Europe, Family Doctors may act as gate-keepers, as they do in the UK, or as signposts where they just act as a conduit to secondary care. The second course means that they do not deal with chronic disease management so do not have the pressures that the increasing shift to general practice of disease management that used to be dealt with in hospital clinics. In many EU states, children are seen by paediatricians not by GPs and gynaecological problems are referred for examination and investigation to gynaecologists.
Elderly people who are resident in nursing homes may be under the care of Community Physicians or, as in Holland, Nursing Home Doctors. Mental illness may be referred directly to secondary care.
Workload and practice
List sizes vary from 600 per GP in Belgium to 3,500 per GP in Turkey and consultation rates per GP vary from 10 a day to 50 a day. This figure is confused by the fact that some replies counted telephone consultations as well where other nations just rated face-to-face consultations.
Group practices are gradually becoming the norm throughout Europe, though Belgium still has only 3% of practices with more than one doctor. In Italy roughly 50% of practices are group practices and in the Netherlands about 75%. The UK is still far ahead with more than 90% of practices being group practices. E also have larger groups of doctors. In much of Europe practices have 2-3 doctors as opposed to our average of 6-7.
Most have list sizes of 1600 or lower and that I itself makes for a less stressful environment. The working day generally approaches the normal for the working population of the country being 8 hours a day or fewer – in the Danish system GP surgeries close at 4 pm on Monday to Thursday and at 2 pm on Friday. The health of the Danish population does not seem to be adversely affected by this restriction of GP hours of access. However despite this 76% of EU nations feel that general practice workload is unreasonable and unsustainable.
If the nations that think the workload in general practice is reasonable are examined, they tend to have some factors in common. They have a normal working day – that is, eigth hours or fewer and mostly have a list size of 1600 or fewer per GP. They are more likely to have longer consultations and, of course, have easier access into secondary care beds. However, the factor that seems to be the most important is the number of patient consultations per doctor per day.
Consultation length and duration
Most nations have 15 minute consultations with the Scandinavian countries veering towards 20-25 minutes. Those nations with 25 consultations or less a day find general practice manageable. Those nations who either have telephone consultations or face-to-face consultations that exceed 25 patient contacts a day per doctor find general practice unsustainable. They have problems in both retaining GPs and in recruiting newly qualified doctors to a GP training programme.
Home visits
Most do little home visiting – though this may be due to the greater availability of beds in European countries. The UK has the lowest bed numbers per 100,000 population in Europe with France having double the beds and Germany three times as many. This means that admission of sick patients is more or less the norm, rather tha, as in the UK, making huge efforts to keep patients out of hospital.
Summary
A profession under stress is a profession at risk. Maybe the answer is simply to reduce access to EU levels; to restrict doctor-patient contacts, both telephone and face-to-face consultations, to fewer than 25 a day. It may be possible to divert some demands to pharmacists, nurses or other health professionals. It may be possible to educate the public to self-care, at least for minor illnesses.
General practitioners are expensive and time-consuming to train. It would be sensible to use their skills carefully.

Thoughtful and interesting! Thank you for posting. Makes me realise just how many quarts we are already squeezing into a pint pot. Also validates my stress levels! We have become the cheap dumping ground for the NHS used by a population who increasingly don’t value a “free” service. General Practice in the UK is being strangled: Unless it is radically improved and better resourced it will die.

It all comes back to underfunding. The BMA needs I believe to run a publicity campaign to tell people they need to pay more or lose their service. We spend billions on gambling as well as in charity donations annually. Some of this money needs to come to the NHS urgently and we could achieve the care and job satisfaction of our European colleagues. Come on BMA!

German here. It would be interesting to see how workload varies between signposter GPs and gatekeeper GPs. It could be that workload is shifted onto specialists (as in Germany, where children see
pediatricians). Having moved from a signposter to a gatekeeper culture (the NHS), I must say that given a manageable workload, I find the UK system far more holistic and efficient.
In addition, it’s important to look at the support system that doctors have. German doctors’ assistants are often far less well trained and qualified than the practice nurses and midwives that work in a typical UK group practice.
It seems to me that the UK doesn’t realize what it has in its GP system.

Yes we realise all right !
Longer waiting times spent on phones just to get an appt. Longer waiting times just to get to see a GP. Longer waiting times to see a specialist and longer waiting times for test results
!!!
In Germany and in Thailand seeing a specialist, being sent for tests and getting test results at all got on the SAME day !!!
Plus you do not need to see a GP first, you can go directly to a specialist !

What happens after 4pm in Denmark? Do people use the common sense that is so lacking in UK patients?

Brexit and statins: a tale of scepticism
Posted by BJGP Life | 7 Sep 2016 | Opinion, Political, Undergraduate | 0
Christien Fortune is a final year medical student at The University of Manchester and has interests in cardiology and medical education.
In the fabled land of post-June 23rd Britain and Northern Ireland, politics in the UK has been understandably dominated by the UK’s decision to exit the European Union. Vote Leave’s successful campaign, in part, utilised the public’s deep seated suspicion of the juggernaut that is the multinational political union of the European Union; one that in the eyes of the “Brexiteers” yielded little benefit despite its large cost to the UK. What was remarkable was the resonation of Leave’s message with the older population; according to YouGov poll over 64% of over-65s voted to leave the EU.1 The merits of EU membership can be debated until the end of time, but something which is unequivocally clear is that the older generation, in general, did not want to be part of the EU.1
As a casual observer of the UK political scene and avid viewer of the BBC programme, Question Time, I couldn’t help seeing striking parallels between the public attitude towards the EU and another juggernaut, this time of the pharmacological variety. To understand the aspersions surrounding statins is bewildering; at the time of writing, a Cochrane review of 19 studies assessing the value of statins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease revealed a marked reduction in all-cause mortality, major vascular events and revascularisation.2 Objectively, it seems unmistakably clear that statins have a major role to play in preventing our cardiovascular disease-baiting, overweight country. Unfortunately, the very nature of opinion does not lie in objectivity. In my admittedly limited experience, I have found a sizeable number of older patients sceptical about the benefits of statins. In broad agreement with my anecdotes, a study looking at adherence in secondary disease prevention for coronary artery disease in a US population revealed that consistent use of lipid-lowering therapy was 44%.3 The US does have other financial factors which will play a role in adherence, however, I’m sure that for certain healthcare professionals, this message will sound familiar. It is interesting that in the case of both the European Union and statins, scepticism seems to be the default setting of the UK’s older generation. Why is it that for a demographic, we (either Remain or medical professionals, take your pick) fail to convince them of a benefit which may be inconspicuous?
Although the older generation’s relationship with statins doesn’t pose quite as bigger problem to the future of our economy as the Referendum result will, it does still have important ramifications to an individual’s cardiovascular-related mortality. A failure to address the unhealthy relationship in those who are wary about the effects of statins has the potential to detrimentally affect the very lives we seek to care for. In a Scottish population, those who were compliant with statin use were more likely to have had the consequences of hyperlipidaemia emphasised.4 Tolmie et al also highlighted the need to a regular addressing of any concerns patients may have in order to prevent patients discontinuing medication without letting their doctor know.4 At the same time, there has to be some serious PR to promote the undoubted benefits of statins in the appropriate cohorts.
Interestingly enough, as was the case in the referendum, a major stumbling block in convincing the public about the benefits of their respective causes is the work of the tabloids. In a 15-day period, the Daily Mail published articles on their website with the following titles, “Statins ‘may be waste of time’…”,5 “Millions of people may be needlessly taking statins every day…”6 and “Don’t give up your statins…”.7 This startling contradiction indicates the type of mixed messages that the public is being told; it is unreasonable to expect the general public to be able critically analyse the underlying research and human nature means that the take home message will be the title in bold above the text. Naturally, this type of journalism creates the perfect conditions to promote widespread reservations about statin use. Therefore, it is up to healthcare professionals to combat the seeds of doubt surrounding statin use and provide a clear and coherent message about the advantage of using statins.
Now, the ship may have sailed across the Channel with respect to the UK’s membership but its sister ship containing some positivity about statins is still in the docks, albeit with increasingly frayed moorings. As doctors, we need to make sure that we shore up the public’s trust in statins; it is, of course, in their interest and that is something that it is easy to overlook.

BJGP Long Read: Mistakes and responsibilities
Posted by Peter Aird | 10 Dec 2019 | BJGP Long Read | 0
Peter Aird is a GP in Bridgwater, Somerset.
This week I recalled a study day that I went to some years ago. Suitably interactive, involving a variety of teaching styles and fully addressing a personally relevant learning need, it was the best educational event that I’ve ever attended. Given how excellent it was, you might be surprised to hear that I did not claim any CPD points for being there. The reason for this, seemingly schoolboy, error was, however, simply this – it was a Speed Awareness Course.
The day began with the leader asking for a show of hands from all those present who’d told friends and family that they were attending the course that day. Most hands went up, as did the corners of many people’s mouths, their smiles suggesting that few, if any, were ashamed at having been required to be there. The leader then pointed out that breaking the speed limit was no less likely to cause a road traffic accident than driving whilst over the legal blood alcohol limit. He then asked how many people would have told friends and family they were on the course had it been run for those who had committed a drink driving offence. You’ll not be surprised to learn that no hands went up. Later in the day, those gathered were asked to list the reasons why, on occasions, they might drive faster than the law permitted. A substantial list was generated. A short recording was then played of a man describing how his child had been killed by a speeding motorist. The leader then commented how our list, made up of what we had felt were potentially justifiable reasons for speeding, now seemed like nothing but a collection of weak excuses. It was a highly effective learning experience.
Over the years I have made mistakes as a doctor.
I was reminded of all this whilst discussing with a friend how we cope with our failures. We tend to be uncomfortable accepting that we sometimes make mistakes and so, when we do err, we are want to try to preserve our spotless image, either by relativising our failures such that there are not really seen as failures at all or, alternatively, justifying them by insisting they were understandable given the circumstances at the time. Over the years I have made mistakes as a doctor, some of which have had significant consequences for patients and I am conscious of having adopted both these approaches in an attempt to preserve an image of myself that I am comfortable with, one in keeping with what I perceive a doctor should be, specifically that of one who is immune to error. What the speed awareness course taught me was just how inappropriate and foolish both these approaches really are.
In the Spiderman films, Peter Parker is warned by his Uncle Ben that ‘with great power comes great responsibility’. As health professionals, the power that we have over our patients may not be equivalent to that of a superhero, I trust none of us are that arrogant, but it is still significant. And so, regardless of how uncomfortable it may make us feel, we have to take responsibility for what we do.
That sometimes means owning my mistakes and feeling the genuine regret of not being as good a doctor as others need me to be.
For me, as a doctor, that sometimes means owning my mistakes and feeling the genuine regret of not being as good a doctor as others need me to be. This isn’t, I trust, an exercise in self pity that forgets who it is who has suffered most as a consequence of my mistakes, but simply an honest acknowledgment of the reality of the sadness that my inevitable mistakes bring to myself as well as others. Though it would be kind of you to do so, please don’t try to reassure me by telling me I’m ‘good enough’. Because, as a doctor, as in every area of my life, it simply isn’t always the case. Though sometimes, of course, I am good enough, maybe even most of the time, sometimes, really, I am seriously not. Because the truth is that I make mistakes – real mistakes that really matter, mistakes for which there are no mitigating circumstances sufficient to absolve me of the responsibility for what I have done.
I don’t believe I am alone.
Of course, some of the errors we all make are indeed the result of the unreasonable demands of the job but, however loudly we may shout about how hard the job can be, we know that it is not always the case. And so we cannot drown out the words that we continue to whisper to ourselves, words that tell us that we could have done better, words that we know are, at least sometimes, true.
So what then? How are we to cope when we fail?
Given that I am in a confessional mood with regard to my history of driving offences, let me tell you about something else that happened to me some years ago. One sunny afternoon, I was merrily driving along the North Devon Relief Road on my way to visit my parents. when I noticed a police car following on behind. It was flashing its somewhat ostentatious blue lights at me. Well, I thought, I’d better stop and see if the police officer concerned wanted any help with his enquiries. And you know what – he did! In fact, so keen was he to have my assistance, that he invited me to step out of my car and join him in his.
Now I should point out that at this point I had no idea what he wanted to talk to me about. Perhaps, I wondered, it was simply that he was rather proud of his car and just wanted to show me how much better it was compared to mine! Because better it most certainly was – it even had a built-in camera which he delighted to demonstrate, by replaying the footage he had taken of my driving too close to the car in front me for the previous four miles. ‘Only a fool,’ he said, ‘breaks the two second rule’ and though I hadn’t appreciated it at the time, I realise now that he was, by implication, saying that a fool was what I was. He then went on to tell me that my crime of ‘driving without due care and attention’ was worthy of a court appearance and six points on my licence. I was somewhat taken aback.
When I make a mistake I am not comforted by the profession closing ranks around me.
Now, whilst I could have tried at that point to argue that my offence wasn’t really as bad as all that, or attempted to come up with some mitigating factors to justify why I had been driving the way I had, it would have done me no good. It was the proverbial ‘fair cop’. And so I simply apologised, hoping against hope that he might show me some leniency. And, amazingly, he did. Without the need to beg, or indeed cry, and for reasons I still don’t really understand, he let me off, simply urging me to drive more carefully in the future. I suppose you could say he forgave me!
I don’t know about you, but when I make a mistake I am not comforted by the profession closing ranks around me and insisting that I am OK – not when, deep down, I know that I’m not. Neither, as some suggest, can I make myself feel better by ‘forgiving myself’ for the harm I have done to others since, surely, only those so harmed can possibly forgive me for what I have done to them. What has helped though, far more so than the actions of that kindly police officer one Sunday afternoon on the A361, is when, having apologised to a patient for my mistake, my apology has been graciously accepted. Though the harm done remains, and the regret remains real, it helps me to carry on knowing that my error is no longer held against me – that I’m accepted despite my faults. Recently there was an article in the newspapers saying that kind doctors had healthier patients. Be that as it may, what is more certain still is that kind patients have healthier, and happier, doctors.
Of course though, not all patients will be so forgiving – that is their right. What then?
Well, if it’s hard to have made mistakes that are forgiven, then it’s harder still to have made
mistakes that aren’t. To live with the knowledge that our actions have harmed another who, not unreasonably, continues to hold it against us is, I’m afraid, part of the job. So when our turn comes, it may just help a little to know that it’s something we all will experience at some point in our careers.
Because to sometimes fail is normal.
I know how reassuring it was for me when, as a still relatively young GP, a highly respected senior colleague of mine spoke of how he also knew what it was to experience the pain and regret of having made mistakes. Though at that time the mistake was mine, it helped to know that mine was not the only mistake. Though I still knew sadness and regret, it helped that sadness and regret was not only mine to know.
We should instead acknowledge our ordinariness and quietly accept one another.
And so, rather than tending towards protesting, sometimes a little too much, how wonderful we all are, we should instead acknowledge our ordinariness and quietly accept one another, not on account of how marvellous we manage to portray ourselves to be, but rather on the basis that we all know ourselves to be less than perfect. As well as great responsibility, we need to appreciate that, with great power comes the need for great personal honesty, regardless of how painful the truth we consequently have to face might be.
The problem is, of course, that we are all only human. For me, the answer to that problem, isn’t to find self-acceptance by considering myself ‘good enough’ since it is patently obvious to me that, on occasions at least, I’m not. Nor do I believe I do others a favour by trying to convince them when they fail that they remain ‘good enough’ since to do so only burdens them with the endless struggle of pretending to be what they know, all too well, they’re not either. Personally, I need to know the security that comes from being accepted, not on the basis of who I pretend to be, but who I really am, not as a result of being a perfect doctor but rather because someone, who despite knowing I fall well short of that ideal, accepts me just the same. Perhaps you do to.
For this is love.
We are fortunate indeed if we know such unconditional acceptance supporting us when times are hard, but to expect it within the workplace is perhaps unrealistic given that professional standards need to be maintained and the public has to be protected. Nonetheless, within the profession, were we to care for each other with a healthy appreciation of our limitations, what Atul Gawande calls our ‘necessary fallibility’, not only would it alleviate the burden felt by those who imagine everyone else is performing so much better than they are themselves, but it would also surely bring about the more nurturing environment required if we are to see ourselves becoming the better doctors we all so long to be.
But for that to happen we are going to have to stop pretending that mistakes are only made by those anonymous others that we read about in the paper – those who allow us to feel better about ourselves by being there for us to collectively look down upon. Instead we need to be honest enough to admit that it is we who sometimes make mistakes, that each of us are just ordinary, and that none of us are all that we’re sometimes cracked up to be.
That is the truth, at least it is for me.

GP home visits: more evidence is urgently needed to inform debate
Posted by BJGP Life | 3 Dec 2019 | Research | 0
This article is written by Drs Sarah Mitchell, Sarah Hillman, David Rapley, and Professor Jeremy Dale from the Unit of Academic Primary Care based at Warwick Medical School.
The general practitioner (GP) home visit has long been regarded core to general practice in the UK and Western Europe (1). However, at the recent Local Medical Committee Conference in November 2019, after heated debate about GP capacity to deliver home visits, a motion was passed with 54% of the vote, to instruct the General Practitioners Committee (GPC – the negotiating arm of the British Medical Association) to “remove the anachronism of home visits from core contract work”. 74% of voters backed a motion to “negotiate a separate acute service for urgent visits”. Health Secretary Matt Hancock immediately rejected the outcome of the vote, promising extra resources for training and funding for more GPs and practice staff.
For others, home visits are considered core to general practice.
The ensuing debate in the national media, GP press and social media, highlighted a remarkable diversity of views around the value of home visits. Some propose that patients should not be able to “demand” home visits as an entitlement or alternative to a surgery appointment. For others, home visits are considered core to general practice and there are concerns that removing them from the GP contract would “sell the heart and soul of our profession away”, sending a message to patients that their doctor no longer cares for them.
What is unclear is the extent to which the debate about home visiting is intended to highlight the pressure that primary care is under, or whether it is truly about the value of home visits. The building pressure and demand on primary care is well documented and forms the basis of a number of high profile campaigns. The growing complexity of the aging population, with highly complex multi-morbidity, and diverse family and social situations, plays an important part. So do many other factors, many of which are eloquently listed by GP Dr Margaret McCartney on Twitter following the LMC vote; managing the problems caused by drug shortages, missed hospital appointments, supporting patients with troublesome symptoms when hospital outpatient appointments or surgery is delayed, and writing letters of support for employment tribunals and housing applications. Perhaps by addressing some of these, as Dr McCartney suggests, GPs would have more time to visit housebound and highly vulnerable patients, including those approaching the end of life.
It is striking that the GP home visit has practically no evidence base to enhance understanding of its purpose or role.
In a healthcare system where it is expected that contracts are underpinned by evidence-based medicine, it is striking that the GP home visit has practically no evidence base to enhance understanding of its purpose or role. The scant amount of research evidence that is available suggests that there is unwillingness amongst younger GPs to provide home visits (2), but GPs who gain experience of home visits during their training are more likely to undertake home visiting post qualification (2). There is also a positive association between GP home visit rates and achieving end of life care at home (3). However, there is little evidence about the outcome of home visits, the impact on patient care or the role of the GP, or other members of the primary care team, during those visits.
Furthermore, current training in home visits is limited. For GP trainees, their home visits may not be observed or monitored and they receive little guidance or feedback on how best to conduct the visit. Barriers to assessment include logistical constraints, staff and safety concerns (4). Summative assessment of home visits (within the MRCGP Clinical Skills Assessment) occurs in only half of exams and not in a realistic setting. Formative assessment tools (Clinical Observational Tools COTS) for home visits are lacking.
There are also significant challenges in undertaking accurate clinical assessments of a patient’s condition.
GPs undertake home visits for a range of different reasons. Some are reactive when there is an acute and sudden deterioration in a patient’s health. Others are more proactive, involve the development of relational continuity of care between GPs and patients, which is especially important for patients who are unable to travel to the GP because of chronic disease, palliative care and other serious debilitating conditions. Assessing a patient in their home differs to a surgery setting. While there is potential to understand how a patient functions in their usual environment, and the effects on their health, there are also significant challenges in undertaking accurate clinical assessments of a patient’s condition, particularly when they are acutely unwell. The lack of point of care testing in general practice compounds the problem (5).
In 2003 when the last major reorganisation of the GP contract occurred, 24/7 care was removed. Such changes in out of hours care provision have been associated with compromised continuity of care and subsequent increased rates of admission to hospital during out of hours periods. Given that those whom GPs visit are among the most complex and frail in the community it is likely that removing home visits may result in a higher hospital admission rate, overburdening an already over-stretched secondary care system.
Visits to patients living with medical and social complexity, and those needing continuity of care, must be carried out by GPs.
If GPs retain home visiting in their core working day, then they can (and should) decide who does them. Visits to patients living with medical and social complexity, and those needing continuity of care, must be carried out by GPs; the less complex and perhaps those for nursing homes can be delegated to advanced nurse practitioners or physicians’ assistants. GPs are used to managing uncertainty and risk, abrogating this responsibility risks diluting patient care.
More research is required to inform debate about home visits and the GP contract, particularly taking into account the diverse views that seem to exist amongst GPs. However, robust research will be challenging because the home visit is a complex, multifactorial process, rather than a discrete intervention. Research is needed to provide increased understanding into the nuances and impact of the GP home visit, who it provides benefits to, how, when and why. This would form an important evidence base to inform not only the debate about contract decisions but also the future training and development of the primary care workforce to deliver timely and effective care in the community, and should be considered an urgent priority by research funders and academics in primary care.

All The Little Lights: child sexual exploitation laid bare
Posted by BJGP Life | 27 Jun 2019 | Arts | 0
Original poster from 2017 production
We reviewed All the Little Lights in the March 2019 BJGP. A new production is on 12-17th August at the Tristan Bates Theatre as part of the Camden Fringe Season.
Lucy Mabbitt, one of the actors and co-producers in the three hander writes:
The story, told by award winning playwright Jane Upton, follows three young girls; two are survivors of child sexual exploitation and the other is vulnerable to exposure. One of the girls is also a perpetrator of abuse. The play is written from the girls’ perspective and provides an amazing insight into patterns of abusive behaviour, which we think is a clear and valuable way to help audiences empathise with those in that position.
By performing this piece we hope the audience will have a more nuanced and critical understanding of young people who have experienced child sexual exploitation (CSE), and be equipped to help spot signs and work to protect those at risk.The piece works to help us empathise with not only victims but young perpetrators like the central character Joanne, of which 28% are under 18 and are often misunderstood, disregarded in the national discourse about CSE and left without support or protection. Our production is largely about the importance of listening, and the perils of living in a society where we do not look out for each other.
We are working with care support professionals on a number of points for the project. This includes Safe and Sound, the Derby based charity who work to fight child sexual exploitation and who were involved in the original development of the play at the Nottingham Playhouse in 2015, as well as local charities and services in Camden who work with children, parents and carers affected by CSE.
This is in order to understand the context of the play and its characters and be careful to achieve authenticity, better our goal for using the play as a productive piece of awareness raising, safeguard our audiences, and promote the show among their channels in order to bring in new audiences for whom this story might be relevant. This way, the project is more than just putting on a play.

Next GP Journal Club is Sunday 3rd July at 8pm: migraine and CV disease in women
Posted by BJGP Life | 27 Jun 2016 | Clinical, GP Journal Club | 0
The next GP Journal Club will be discussing the BMJ paper:
Migraine and risk of cardiovascular disease in women: prospective cohort study by Kurth et al.
You can download it here.
Migraine occurs in 15% of the UK adult population and is three times more common in women. This large cohort study from the US suggests that female migraine sufferers are at increased risk of experiencing cardiovascular events. What will this mean for those of us in primary care who have responsibility for managing cardiovascular risk? Should we be advising all female migraine sufferers to take a statin, for instance?
Please read the article and consider your response to the following questions, which will form the basis of our discussion:
Was their PPI strategy appropriate? Would the study have benefited from more patient involvement?
Elevated cholesterol and hypertension were treated as binary variables, is this acceptable
15.2% of the women reported a diagnosis of migraine at baseline. Is this what you would expect if the cohort was representative?
Does it surprise you that the effects of migraine weren’t modified by other factors such as hypertension and smoking?
Based on this study, should we be paying more attention to assessment of migraine sufferers’ CV risk?
Hope to see you all on Twitter next Sunday at 8pm.

Going back to the start – influencing prospective medical students
Posted by BJGP Life | 27 Aug 2015 | Opinion, Undergraduate | 0
James Pearson is an ST3 trainee in Bath and the education scholar for the year.
Suddenly you are sitting there alongside all these very intelligent people and the familiar world of sixth form seems so far away. I still remember my first day at medical school when the year group were told in our welcoming lecture that the majority of us would become GPs. I distinctly remember my reaction and that of all my peers was one of surprise and shock! How could they suggest something as absurd as that?
At that point, our exposure to medicine had mostly involved work experience in secondary care and for a few of us, some volunteering in the charity sector. Only a rare handful had managed to secure some experience in primary care. This was mainly by means of a relative or friend with suitable contacts as there are many barriers; issues with confidentiality and perceived maturity of students to name but two. Looking back, it seemed as though we were programmed from the start and had no aspiration for General Practice – we only had personal experience and tales from the media to inform us.
Consequently, I decided to set out on a quest in my role as the ST3 Bath patch Educational Scholar to try and change this locally. I also wanted to provide an excellent opportunity for GP trainees to lead and organise a placement as well as some experience in supervision. Working alongside my counterpart in the Bristol area (Dr Howse) we recruited 32 sixth formers from schools in the local area who were planning to apply to medicine in the current academic cycle. They were a shortlist of the best as determined by their application form, personal statement and teacher reference including predicted grades. We were overwhelmed by applicants and had to turn away those unless they had a realistic chance of a successful application to medical school.
By meeting them all at our carefully planned one-day preparation course, I observed their enthusiasm for medicine and it was rewarding to be able to enlighten them on topics such as ‘the role of the GP’ and ‘members of a practice team’. It was astounding to hear their views in small group work and as predicted from this and their pre-course questionnaires, their views on General Practice were misled and mistaken. It gave us the chance to set the record straight, promote our career, brief them on confidentiality and explain our expectations of prospective medical students. Overall the feedback we received at the end seemed to have a positive impact on their attitudes and all were keen to undertake the offered work experience in General Practice.
Using the demographic knowledge obtained from the application form, we were able to ensure that no student lived or went to school in the area their allocated practice was based. This had previously been one major barrier when pupils had contacted their local practice and were declined for fear of them knowing some of the patients. They were then allocated a GP trainee and left to liaise together about suitable dates as well as the format of their work experience. Further information from the pre-course questionnaires on three things the pupil wanted to get out of the experience helped trainees plan specific activities for the individual. For example, my allocated student was able to spend time with different members of the practice team and really enjoyed watching minor surgery done at the practice. She was amazed at the variety of things that were on offer and the array of opportunities available.
The first year of this project is now coming to a close and certainly each student now has a subsidiary mentor who could help them through the application process. I really hope that this has given realistic prospective medical students an insight in to primary care and we were able to overcome the barriers to gain the experience. I am not intending to suddenly convert all these students in to budding GPs but I really feel that at the moment as a profession we are not doing enough to promote our career to this group of young minded individuals where a lot of their early experiences can shape their ideas on the future.
Let’s hope that their reaction at their first day at medical school to the obligatory statement of “most people will be GPs” is different to my year group’s.

BJGP Book Review: Out of Chaos Comes a Dancing Star
Posted by BJGP Life | 24 Apr 2015 | Arts, Clinical | 0
Out of Chaos Comes a Dancing Star: Notes on Professional Burnout by Chris Ellis. OpenBooks Press, 2014, PB, 95pp, £18, http://www.lastoutpost.info
This book review was written by Ami Sweetman and was in the April 2015 issue of the BJGP.
The author of this book has a fellowship and doctorate in family medicine, and from 2005 to 209 was an associate professor of family medicine at the University of the United Arab Emirates. He is now back home, semi-retired, and doing family practice in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.
The opening quote from the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche sets the tone, ‘Out of chaos comes a dancing star’, which in its fuller context reads: ‘One must have chaos in oneself to give birth to a dancing star.’
The text derives from his collection of notes taken from experience, workshops, and courses on the management of stress and burnout in medical doctors, and those involved in the healing professions, although he says it applies to all professionals whether in law, business, or driving the school bus. Stress is a common theme risking progression to burnout. His work shows that understanding another person’s trials and tribulations can be a source of inspiration. Although the text has a serious undertone it sparkles with wit throughout.
Insights into some of the struggles experienced by healthcare professionals are revealed, creating an awareness of the similarity of concepts and conditions encountered by all doctors. The book offers advice and motivation to see past the common despairs of working life and provides comfort in the knowledge that you are not alone when times can get tough.
Topics included are: how we see patients, attitudes to medicine and the practice thereof, the organisation of our work, and conflicts. There are quotes from attendees at the workshops, and excerpts from ‘iconic texts’ scattered throughout the book for contemplation.
Even the list of contents is intriguing. For example; the wounded healer; long hours and no sleep; the character of the doctor; management of acute burnout; guilt and loneliness; the Mr God complex; the angry doctor; the doctor–doctor relationship; credentials needed for burnout; know thyself; and finally, the Phoenix Phenomenon.
Fundamentally the problems are of time, or rather the lack of time, overwhelming obligations, anxieties over making errors in diagnosis, the increasingly informed, uninformed, and misinformed patient, and, of course, the burgeoning administrative and management problems. There are numerous splendid quotes and example situations placed throughout the text.
I would encourage you to dive into this treasure trove of medical wisdom and take away those insights that mean the most to you personally. Although many of the concerns are the products of extreme circumstances, it’s fascinating to see how the messages relate to the NHS or similar systems all around the world, no matter how sophisticated we may think our version of health care to be. We all, save a few of us, appear to suffer stress in trying to fulfil our role.

Desperately seeking Plato
Posted by David Misselbrook | 17 May 2016 | Arts, International, Random | 0
We were in Athens with a couple of hours to kill. Acropolised out, too early for Ouzo. We had seen Socrates’ jail cell (almost certainly apocryphal).
We had seen the remains of Aristotle’s Lyceum, lovingly excavated. We had felt the weight of Pericles and the genius of Phidias. So we had a chance to check out an old rumour that the site of Plato’s academy was now marked only by a Texaco garage. (We had just found a Lidl on the site of the battle of Marathon, so who knows?) There it was on the map, “Plato’s Academy Archeological Park”, just a few miles out from the centre of Athens.
According to Alfred North Whitehead all philosophy is a series of footnotes to Plato. When my out of hours driver had been mind blown by the illusory world of “The Matrix”. I explained that this came from a two thousand year old thought experiment that we call Plato’s Cave. Suddenly my driver was interested in philosophy. Plato tackled the problems of perception and how we can (or cannot) know reality long before Descartes or Kant. He and a few mates created western thinking.
So we asked a taxi driver, gnarled as an ancient olive tree, to take us to Plato’s Academy. He looked confused. “But there’s nothing there.” We say that’s OK, we would just like to see the site and take some pictures. “Well, I haven’t been there for years” he said. We offer him our map, which he declines. We leave the tourist trail, driving through run down streets, the never ending layers of graffiti resembling Jackson Pollock’s stream of consciousness. A corner shop displays its stock of “Essex” washing powder, the finest goods on offer.
Unfortunately we have chosen a taxi driver straight from My Big Fat Greek Wedding. He explained all of Greek history with a running commentary on language and civilization, demonstrating exactly What The Greeks Did For Us, which by a remarkable coincidence turned out to be absolutely everything. Triangulating with what I already knew I reckoned about a third was approximately true, albeit exaggerated. We decided not to mention Lord Elgin.
We reached the area on the map. There was a post apocalyptic park of sorts. A couple of adjacent areas of worn and scrappy grass with a few dejected trees were surrounded by railings within what looked like a condemned South London Council Estate. We drove around randomly looking for something the driver recognized. There were no signs, no indication of an archeological site (surely the only square mile in Athens so deprived). The driver stopped to exchange enquiries with puzzled locals, none of who had ever heard of Plato and all of whom clearly wondered if we needed strong psychotropics.
We settled for jumping out of the taxi and taking random photos of the grass, concentrating on the occasional stone wall, which may or may not have been more than fifty years old. The driver became excited by some stone columns in a lock up yard, but on close inspection they were recent architectural salvage. However we found some overgrown stone ruins behind yet another fence, inaccessible and unlabeled. We declared these to be the ruins of Plato’s Academy, and duly photographed the hell out of them.
Driving off through the dystopian labyrinth we found a structure resembling a grey shipping container with the sign “Plato’s Academy Digital Museum”. It was locked. We walked round and found two elderly Greeks. “Come back tomorrow” they advised. A good suggestion except that by then we would be in France.
We drove back. So many shabby streets. We had not even found the Texaco garage. We heard more dodgy political theory than the whole of Plato’s Republic. How was it that this city, so full of ruins (and so full of itself) could not remember its greatest philosopher? We could find no trace of Plato. Not even a cave.
We sped back towards our hotel. Time for Ouzo and another view of the Acropolis.

Women in medicine: increasing in numbers but not regard
Posted by Emily Bailey | 8 Mar 2020 | Opinion | 0
Emily Bailey is a GPST2 in Lewisham. She has interests in clinical research, medical education and medical publishing, and is a Contributing Editor for BJGP Life.
In celebration of the 101st International Woman’s Day, 8th March 2020.
Throughout the last century we have witnessed major advancements for women in the UK, but gender inequalities continue to exist in the workplace. The NHS, established with the intent to treat everyone equally, is no exception. On average, female GPs — who now make up more than half of our workforce — continue to feel undervalued, hold less senior roles, and receive lower pay when compared to men. Thus, as a profession, our responsibility is no longer to improve access to medical school, but to ensure that the female workforce fulfils their potential once in employment, feels supported and appropriately financially remunerated whilst at work, and that women doctors are able to reach senior positions if they want to.
Despite women traditionally taking caring roles within society, it is only in recent years that they have been permitted to do so within a professional capacity. Elizabeth Garrett Anderson was Britain’s first formally qualified and recognised female doctor; she founded the New Hospital for Women in London in 1872 and four years later the Enabling Act formally allowed women to enter medical professions in England. Since then, the number of women entering medical school has increased significantly — 50 years ago women accounted for less than one fifth of the medical workforce and today they represent nearly half.(1) The medical profession may be the first previously male-dominated sector to achieve parity; the majority of qualified GPs are now female, and — following this trend — the majority of all doctors are soon set to be women.
Women more frequently experience harassment — both from patients and colleagues.
However, despite increasing numbers of women entering the profession, a government report in 2009 claimed that female GPs continue to be deprived of contractual rights, denied maternity support, and are missing out on leadership roles.(1) The British Medical Association has been accused of having an “old boys’ club network” culture which treats women as of less importance and ability. Following these claims, an investigation into sexist behaviour revealed that many female doctors feel “undervalued, ignored and patronised because they are women”(2). Women more frequently experience harassment — both from patients and colleagues.(3) It is imperative that capable and effective female GPs are not disadvantaged in this way, and that they can do their jobs without feeling underappreciated, subjected to unwanted sexual advances, or deprived of opportunities to reach positions of seniority.
Just under a third of consultants are female compared to more than half of training grade doctors and 40% of GP partners are female vs 68% of salaried GPs. There are fewer senior female clinical academics, for example Deans of medical schools, and while half of those who get doctoral degrees in the US and Europe are female, less than one in five are professors. Likewise, women continue to be under-represented in key medico-political roles.(4,5) One argument here is that more women work part-time, and it is difficult to be a part-time leader. They may lack the time necessary to invest in extracurricular CV-building activities alongside already busy clinical roles. The choice to work part-time may be influenced by societal expectations that women remain responsible for the majority of childcare commitments, household chores, and family duties. We are effectively now trying to maintain our old societal roles while fighting to have a chance at these new professional ones.(6)
The inequality in pay is likely to further damage the morale and motivation of our female workforce.
Repeated pay reviews highlight that female GPs earn less than male GPs — roughly 65p for every £1 earned by a man doing the same role. A gender pay gap remains even when controlling for those working part-time, and when taking into account whether someone is in a partnership or a salaried role. An argument has been made that women are less willing to negotiate a salary, or that they are perceived as less mobile — seen as tending to move home in line with their partner’s careers or children’s education which weakens their bargaining strength. The inequality in pay is likely to further damage the morale and motivation of our female workforce.
It has long been acknowledged that we need many more doctors, and we must be better at retaining those who are already trained. We invest nearly a quarter of a million pounds in training every doctor — we cannot waste these precious and limited resources.(1) With women set to represent the majority of GPs, we must ensure that they feel respected, valued and motivated. We must have a zero tolerance policy for verbal, physical and sexual harassment. We must make working patterns more flexible to ensure that all doctors can navigate their career alongside their other social roles as a parent or a partner. We must not financially penalise those who choose to have a family, or combine clinical work with other interests, and we must hold regular gender pay reviews to ensure that we close the gender pay gap. If we do not rectify these wrongs, we risk losing valuable and hard-working members of our already dwindling GP community.

Somewhere over the rainbow
Posted by Peter Aird | 29 Oct 2019 | Opinion | 0
Peter Aird is a GP in Bridgwater, Somerset.
Judy Garland’s was not a happy life.
Last weekend I went to see Renée Zellweger in ‘Judy’. It’s a remarkable performance in a film that portrays Judy Garland towards the end of her tragically short life whilst visiting England in 1969. It reveals the effect on her of having been driven to succeed for the benefit of others, compelled to be what she may not have chosen for herself, and controlled by others to the extent of even of being told when she could and could not eat and sleep.
The mental breakdown that followed was surely inevitable. At one point she was asked had she ever taken anything for her “depression”. She replies “Four husbands –
it didn’t work”. It’s not all she took – alcohol and a combination of the uppers and downers she was first plied with as a child fared no better in relieving her unhappiness. The only time she did seem to be happy was, paradoxically perhaps, when she was where her success had taken her, on stage, in front of the audiences that loved her.
But such happiness was only ever short lived. After the success of her opening night’s performance at London’s ‘The Talk of the Town’, Rosalyn Wilder, her personal assistant on her visit to England, congratulated her and tried to reassure her that she was going to be alright. Garland replied, “But what if I can’t do it again?” In a life where she had been shown little love, she needed the love of her audience but knew that this was always dependent on her constantly delivering what those who came to see her wanted. She was right to be anxious. One night, arriving on stage late and the worse for too much alcohol, the crowd turned hostile and pelted her with bread rolls. Their love was not the unconditional love she needed.
The unconditional love we all need.
There were those who seemed to truly care about her. A couple of ordinary folk seem perhaps an unlikely pair for an international star to be drawn too, but her fondness for them becomes wholly understandable when their genuine affection for her allows her to be her true self. Interestingly, it is when she breaks down in public, revealing that true self on stage, exposing how she really feels, that real compassion flows to her from her audience. Only then, as the star becomes an individual, does the barrier between her and her audience come down.
Boarding the conveyer belt of medical training at an impressionable age, we have been controlled by the system much of our lives.
I’m not sure that Judy Garland really knew how she ended up where she did, or that where she ended up was where she ever really wanted to be. So manipulated was she by the world she found herself in as a child that, once she had entered it, she ceased to be who she really was. Some of us may feel similarly. Boarding the conveyer belt of medical training at an impressionable age, we have been controlled by the system much of our lives, even to the extent of being dictated to by the demands of the job as to when we can eat and sleep. Whilst many have survived this ordeal, and have found satisfaction and happiness in medicine, too many have not but and are left struggling on to their detriment.
How, I wonder, do we cope with not being the person others demand that we are?
More importantly perhaps, how do we cope with not being the person we demand that we are ourselves? Not being able to be the person we long to be, how many of us find ourselves asking, with Judy Garland, “Why, O why can’t I?”.
The answer may reveal why we respond the way we do to complaints, however trivial. Might our self esteem be so easily shattered because that self esteem is already so fragile, too dependent after a lifetime of pleasing others, on having to please everyone? Likewise, might not the anxiety we feel as our appraisal approaches result from our being driven to perform at ever greater levels? The need for us each year to show improvement comes with the inherent implication that last year we were still not good enough. We must, we are told, do better.
And so we strive all the more to satisfy those who demand from us, drive ourselves on in the vain hope that if we could only be the better people we ought to be, all would be well.
Over the summer, in an attempt to concentrate on all things cricket as the Ashes series drew to a close and Somerset CCC still had hopes of the county championship, I watched ‘The Edge’, the film that chronicles England’s climb to the top of the world Test rankings. What became apparent was both how hollow the team’s success felt when it was eventually achieved and how costly, in terms of the adverse effect on the mental health of a number of players, that success was when winning became mandatory.
We live in a world which encourages us to follow our heart and promises that our dreams will come true if only we want them to enough. This is a dangerous philosophy to follow since it simply is not the case. We need to wake up to the fact that our dreams will not necessarily come true and that, as for Judy Garland and a number of the England cricket team, too often they turn into a nightmare.
And when all that fails, it leaves too many of us crying and, what’s more, crying alone.
The emotional well-being of medical professionals is no more important that that of patients, but neither is it any less. And just as patients will not be helped by being burdened with the unrealistic goal of being responsible for their dreams coming true, neither will those in health care be helped by increasing demands being put upon them to be perfect. An insistence that we should merely increase our resilience to cope with what is unreasonably asked of us is tantamount to being told to ‘come on and just get happy’. The justification for this, that ‘when we’re smiling, the whole world smiles with us’ may well be true, but thinking like this results in too many of us putting up with a situation we long to escape, imprisoned by our desire to be seen to succeed and be needed, all the while medicating ourselves to get ourselves through the day. And when all that fails, it leaves too many of us crying and, what’s more, crying alone.
None of us are unaffected by our past. Many of our patients come to us struggling as a consequence of hugely adverse circumstances in their childhood and subsequent lives. Some do not understand how they come to be in the situation that they find themselves to be in and need help to escape. Some of us in medicine are no different. We too need to be able to drop the facade of our professional image and be honest about who we are so that we too can receive the same compassion and understanding as our patients.
We all need a little grace. Grace that does not demand that we be what we are not but frees us to become what we truly really are.
But does such a world exist? Is that place just like that elusive pot of gold we merely can dream about, only found somewhere over the rainbow? Let’s hope not.

BJGP Long Read: How to enjoy your consultations
Posted by BJGP Life | 26 Feb 2019 | BJGP Long Read | 1
Julian Marsden has been a GP in Luton for 33 years. He is FRCGP, Provost of the Beds & Herts Faculty, and is a retired Training Programme Director for the Luton GPSTP
I’ve been a GP for over 30 years, but I still enjoy what I do. As others around me take early retirement, I sometimes ask myself why I still enjoy the job and keep doing it. For me, it’s the interaction with patients, getting to know them, forming and developing a relationship where we can feel comfortable, doing something useful and sharing some humour where I can.
The GP consultation is at the heart of what the GP does. It’s the best bit, sitting with and getting to know your patient and their problems and trying together to find a way forward. Anything and everything can come the way of the GP, which makes it all the more interesting, and we have the opportunity to see our patients again and get to know them, even if only a little, and this is fun and rewarding for both; continuity of care is much valued and a strength of general practice.
It helps, of course, to be able to consult effectively, and I learned from Roger Neighbour’s Inner Consultation, the Calgary-Cambridge Guide by Silverman, Kurtz and Draper, and others, such as The Anxious Patient by Bendix and Peter Tate’s The Doctor’s Communication Handbook. Listening to the advice of many GP luminaries such as Roger Neighbour himself, Jonathan Silverman, David Haslam and others helps reinforce important messages.
This isn’t a consultation guide; instead it encapsulates some of the things I have learned over many years.
Developing consultation skills goes on throughout one’s career and if you didn’t make time to read those consultation texts during your training, why not make time afterwards? The last textbook I read on the subject was Neighbour’s Inner Physician, an excellent and thoughtful book giving rich insight into how we consult but at a deeper level than a consultation guide, exploring some of the perceptual skills and developing an awareness of what we are thinking and feeling and how this might be useful during the consultation.
There is so much good advice out there and it can seem daunting to distil this into a simple guide. This isn’t a consultation guide; instead it encapsulates some of the things I have learned over many years; it is what I do. There might be one or two ideas that may be useful to you.
Simple advice is easier to remember, however. David Haslam spoke about his four rules: Shut Up, Listen, Do Something Useful, and Care. I love that, so simple, succinct and so true. Roger Neighbour talks about the patient’s bit, then the doctor’s bit, then the shared bit. Again, so simple but so true; the shared bit reminds me about shared understanding and shared management plans.
I like to put something personal about patients that is easily seen, such as in the reminders section.
Before I start, I try and look at the patient record. This may take less than a minute so it’s perfectly feasible. Patients will often assume that you know everything in their records even though in reality you haven’t had 20 minutes to read all the letters! But a brief look at the summary and problem list and the previous consultation is time well spent. The repeat prescription list gives a quick clue and if full of cardiac meds then you know they have a cardiac problem, for instance. I like to put something personal about patients that is easily seen, such as in the reminders section. This might be only visible to you, so you can mention the name of their spouse, if they have children, what they do for a living, what they do at other times such as sport or other hobbies, or what they are studying or hoping to do in their future career, or their favourite football team.
I add this stuff after the consultation and it can be read with a second’s glance before they come in. The personal details might be relevant in the consultation, but if not can be a basis for friendly conversation at the end of the consultation, which is fun and all part of developing rapport which helps next time you see them. It is difficult to achieve the continuity that GPs had in the past, as we usually work in teams nowadays and not necessarily full-time, but a brief mention of something in the personal section helps the patient feel known as a person. This helps with the “Getting to know your patient” and I think it makes a big difference.
Rapport is so important. The initial smile and greeting are crucial. With small children, I usually focus on the parent with my best attempt at a warm smile, as if Mum is happy and welcomed and at ease, the child will sense this and hopefully relax a little. Expressing delight in a coloured pair of socks or the design on a T shirt is a helpful distraction though this is reserved for small children as adults might give me a funny look! I still wear cartoon ties, even though they went out of fashion 20 years ago; but it is one way I have of not taking myself too seriously and helping my younger patients feel a little more relaxed, especially if they’re two years old and frightened of doctors.
We have all heard about the golden minute, whereby, if you allow the patient, most of the relevant information will emerge, so long as they are not interrupted. Or will it? Actually, we generally only elicit half the patient’s complaints and concerns. And the main concern may not be the first mentioned. Listening and watching carefully with full attention is key.
As we have two ears but only one mouth, we should listen twice as much as we talk.
Listening carefully is crucial, and showing that you have listened equally so, whether for a complicated history or minor illness as subsequent reassurance will be more effective if the mother of a toddler with a cough and a temperature who ran smiling into the room may be worried nonetheless that something is really wrong. I once heard at a trainers’ seminar that as we have two ears but only one mouth, we should listen twice as much as we talk.
Caring, or compassion, and showing it, is so important for patients. We can be forgiven for a multitude of errors if we are nice about it. How to show compassion? That you care?
There are some simple things that I have found to help. After the patient has told you about their problem, acknowledge what they have said, so they know you have understood, then say something empathic. For example: “She’s been coughing all night and been burning up.” You might say something like: “That must have worried you?” or “And you’ve had no sleep either then?” it might be tempting to ask if her child is well-cooked, having been burned to a frazzle, but this doesn’t work.
I know a GP who welcomes his patients into his consulting room by standing up and, with arms wide, proceeds to hug them. I don’t do this. Touch can be powerful of course, and a light hand on your patient’s forearm can say a thousand words, but I don’t do this much either. Perhaps in a bereavement situation. David Haslam once said at a conference that elderly patients he saw on home visits appreciated it if he sat down. This sounds simple, but of course it shows clearly that he has the time and inclination to listen and not rush, as opposed to standing there and appearing impatient to get on.
I do know some doctors who stand throughout the consultation to encourage speed, but I don’t do this. I have heard that some doctors have a chair for the patient with a slope on the seat to encourage the patient to get up sooner, but I don’t do this either! At the beginning, I stand up, find the patient from the waiting room and smile and greet them. I usually say: “Hi, How can I help?” as I ask them to sit down, or after they have sat down. I try and observe the patient as they come in and a limp with a wince is a good clue or a worried expression will raise my antennae, for instance.
Let them tell their story. Allow them to voice concerns and volunteer ideas
. If you allow the patient to talk, they will usually tell you why they have come to see you, what their problems are and why they may be concerned. Let them tell their story. Allow them to voice concerns and volunteer ideas. Open questions facilitate this. It is important to let your patient know that you have heard and understood what they have said, and a simple summary spoken back to them helps. If you don’t, they may keep repeating themselves and feel frustrated. A simple summary allows the patient to feel understood and then allow the consultation to progress; or it may allow the patient to mention something else which may be important.
This is part of agenda setting and where appropriate, a negotiation about what can be covered first, second etc and what can be deferred if need be. “X sounds important and Y also so shall we deal with those first and see how we get on?” is better than “I only have 10 minutes, so may not have time to deal with….”. Then I ‘go with the flow’, where the consultation goes naturally, exploring and clarifying, sharing thoughts. Structure of the consultation is important but so is flexibility. Drilling down to clarify issues can involve closed questions but avoid these early on. Some local knowledge helps: the word ‘flu’ in Luton means a runny nose, nothing more, nothing less. Eye contact, posture and facial expressions are some of the non-verbal techniques we use to facilitate communication and staring at the computer does nothing to promote engagement with the patient.
Exploring ideas, concerns and expectations is a mantra distilled into us as trainees and of course is important; but this can be done naturally rather than in a formulaic way, if and when it feels appropriate. Being curious about the patient’s experience is key. How their symptoms affect them, what they mean to them, gives a deeper understanding. Patients are often just as interested in what the problem is, why it has happened and what is likely to happen, as any solutions I might try to suggest.
Has examination of the patient gone out of fashion?
I usually examine my patients whenever this is clinically appropriate. I don’t know how I am supposed to know if someone’s pain is lumbar, hip or trochanteric for instance, if I don’t examine them. It surprises me when patients say that this is the first time that they have been examined in such a situation. The laying-on of hands is something we are allowed to do in our privileged role as doctors, and it can be a powerful way of reassurance, and helping the patient feel that they are being taken seriously and it may be clinically useful too, of course.
Has examination of the patient gone out of fashion? I usually explain what I am doing as my patient might not realise. A close relative had to be examined by a Professor in London, and he lifted up her top without warning and exclaimed: “It’s hard to tell anything through this flab!” She was not impressed. In fact, she felt humiliated. Any kind of examination is an invasion of privacy and potentially embarrassing for the patient. They’ve probably decided to wear their best underwear if they think they need to be examined, and it’s important to be respectful and considerate and put them at their ease.
A bit of humour is fine. “You can take alcohol with those antibiotics if you wish, but no lager, it must be real ale!” Or if you support Arsenal you might need a stronger antibiotic! Nowadays, more often than not, the patient says they don’t drink alcohol. Or, when doing a urine dipstick test, I might comment that it looks like a chardonnay. I suppose others might suggest a darjeeling tea.
Summarising is important as it draws issues to a close, and it also allows the patient to feedback their ideas and concerns, particularly if I have missed something. This is part of shared understanding and a mutually agreed way forward can follow. Summarising is a useful technique if I feel lost as it allows me to collect my thoughts openly and the patient or I might choose to change direction. If the patient doesn’t buy into the plan, then they won’t agree to follow the plan.
The consultation may last only ten minutes and I am there to help my patient and they will decide at the end of the day whether they choose to take the tablet I have prescribed, or engage with a counsellor, or make lifestyle changes or whatever we have agreed. The patient is a partner in the consultation and they need to be involved in decisions. If I were in my patient’s shoes, would I follow my advice? A shared management plan involves respecting the patient’s autonomy. Sometimes I find some personal disclosure helpful. I don’t try and force statins on patients, but I might say that I take them myself and the conversation becomes more adult to adult than parent to child as we look together at the computer’s 10-year risk estimation and weigh up what it really means.
One of the fun bits of general practice is getting to know your patients as people. This fosters some brief conversation beyond what they came about. If I know my patient follows Arsenal, for instance, I might bemoan the fact that they always seem to win against my team, Everton. If they follow Watford or Southampton, then the reverse applies; all good fun. Knowing that a young person is embarking on a degree course, previously recorded in the reminders section seen only by me, then I can enquire about their progress. The little bit of informal conversation may help them to see their doctor as a human being who has a genuine interest in them and that seems to me to be a good thing.
Reaching out from one human being to another, is the stuff of general practice.
Closing the consultation seems to be a challenge for some trainees. This is problematic if you haven’t dealt with the patient’s problems and an unwillingness to leave the room is a sure-tell sign. Sometimes the patient might not leave because the prescription is still sitting on the printer and they have to remind me to sign it and give it to them. Memory lapses can affect doctors too.
Building rapport, connecting, establishing a relationship, knowing your patient as a person, all this sounds like jargon, but it is at the heart of being a GP and the bit that I enjoy. Trying to understand what it feels like to be a distressed teenager, a young parent with an ill child, or someone who has been bereaved. Knowing that my patient was widowed a year ago allows me to make a gentle enquiry as to how they are getting on, sometimes almost unsaid but communicated simply, that reaching out from one human being to another, is the stuff of general practice.

BJGP Book Review: Out of Chaos Comes a Dancing Star
Posted by BJGP Life | 24 Apr 2015 | Arts, Clinical | 0
Out of Chaos Comes a Dancing Star: Notes on Professional Burnout by Chris Ellis. OpenBooks Press, 2014, PB, 95pp, £18, http://www.lastoutpost.info
This book review was written by Ami Sweetman and was in the April 2015 issue of the BJGP.
The author of this book has a fellowship and doctorate in family medicine, and from 2005 to 209 was an associate professor of family medicine at the University of the United Arab Emirates. He is now back home, semi-retired, and doing family practice in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.
The opening quote from the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche sets the tone, ‘Out of chaos comes a dancing star’, which in its fuller context reads: ‘One must have chaos in oneself to give birth to a dancing star.’
The text derives from his collection of notes taken from experience, workshops, and courses on the management of stress and burnout in medical doctors, and those involved in the healing professions, although he says it applies to all professionals whether in law, business, or driving the school bus. Stress is a common theme risking progression to burnout. His work shows that understanding another person’s trials and tribulations can be a source of inspiration. Although the text has a serious undertone it sparkles with wit throughout.
Insights into some of the struggles experienced by healthcare professionals are revealed, creating an awareness of the similarity of concepts and conditions encountered by all doctors. The book offers advice and motivation to see past the common despairs of working life and provides comfort in the knowledge that you are not alone when times can get tough.
Topics included are: how we see patients, attitudes to medicine and the practice thereof, the organisation of our work, and conflicts. There are quotes from attendees at the workshops, and excerpts from ‘iconic texts’ scattered throughout the book for contemplation.
Even the list of contents is intriguing. For example; the wounded healer; long hours and no sleep; the character of the doctor; management of acute burnout; guilt and loneliness; the Mr God complex; the angry doctor; the doctor–doctor relationship; credentials needed for burnout; know thyself; and finally, the Phoenix Phenomenon.
Fundamentally the problems are of time, or rather the lack of time, overwhelming obligations, anxieties over making errors in diagnosis, the increasingly informed, uninformed, and misinformed patient, and, of course, the burgeoning administrative and management problems. There are numerous splendid quotes and example situations placed throughout the text.
I would encourage you to dive into this treasure trove of medical wisdom and take away those insights that mean the most to you personally. Although many of the concerns are the products of extreme circumstances, it’s fascinating to see how the messages relate to the NHS or similar systems all around the world, no matter how sophisticated we may think our version of health care to be. We all, save a few of us, appear to suffer stress in trying to fulfil our role.

Stave One – in which Scrooge reveals how burnt out he is
Old Dr Marley was dead. As dead as the NHS would be within a couple of years if things didn’t start to improve soon. And, as far as Dr Ebenezer Scrooge was concerned, Jacob Marley was better off out of it. Scrooge and Marley had been long term partners and Scrooge greatly missed his former colleague who had died several years earlier. This was not the result of any affection he had had for the man, that was not in Scrooge’s nature, but rather on account of the fact that, due to the national shortage of GPs, he had been unable to find a replacement, and his workload had consequently increased beyond the point of being manageable.
It was Christmas Eve and Scrooge was sat at the desk in his consulting room. It was nearly three in the afternoon. Morning surgery had only just finished and this was now what was laughably called his ‘lunch break’. An email flashed up on his computer screen. It was from the CCG wishing him a merry Christmas.
‘Bah!’ muttered Scrooge to himself. ‘Humbug! If they really wanted my Christmas to be merry, then perhaps they and NHS England could have agreed that I didn’t have to make up the
Advanced Access hours, lost from not opening the surgery on Christmas Day, later in the week. Every idiot,’ he continued, ‘who goes about with “Merry Christmas” on his lips should be submitted to unnecessary colonoscopic examination and be forced to reflect on the experience for the purposes of revalidation.’
Dr Scrooge was not one to enjoy Christmas, and being encouraged to be merry served only to darken his already black mood still further. The situation was not helped by the arrival of a receptionist who announced her presence with a knock on his already open door.
‘Sorry to trouble you Dr Scrooge, but the Salvation Army band are playing Christmas carols in the car park and are asking if you would like to make a donation.’ She handed him a leaflet informing him that this Christmas many people would not have anywhere to sleep due to the lack of hospital beds resulting from years of chronic NHS underfunding. Scrooge sighed – this was nothing he didn’t already know. Only that morning he had been asked to arrange a review over the holiday period of a patient that was about to be discharged, a little earlier than was ideal, from the local, desperately overworked, hospital. Though he regretted being unable to promise that level of care, his refusal then had been unequivocal and he was no more minded now, at his own personal expense, to start financially propping up a system left destitute by the establishment.
As far as he was concerned, he was already paying quite enough tax and, given that he had just learnt that the security of his pension was now somewhat precarious, he felt it was unlikely that he would change his mind on the matter. He stood up and slammed the door in his informant’s face. Sensibly, the receptionist interpreted that as a ‘No’ and scuttled back to where her colleagues were celebrating Christmas with a box of mince pies and a tube of Prosecco and pink peppercorn Pringles – the latter, notwithstanding the alliteration, surely an ill-advised flavour choice, regardless of the season.
Scrooge had been invited to share in the festivities but he had no desire to do so. Nor did he have time. Instead he returned to his computer screen and started the never-ending task of clearing his inbox of lab results, hospital letters, and prescription requests. He’d barely started when there was another knock at the door. Scrooge barked out a ‘What is it?’ and the door swung open to reveal the ST3 who had been with the practice since August. Dr Robert Cratchit was a highly capable doctor though one who lacked confidence in his own ability. To Scrooge’s dismay he was wearing a Christmas jumper.
‘What do you want? Can’t you see I’m busy?
These words were not unfamiliar to Dr Cratchit, who, over the previous five months, had heard them frequently from the man who purported to be his trainer. In fact, so frequently had he heard them that, for a time, he had used them to start all consultations with patients, imagining them to be the profession’s approved opening words for all doctor-patient interactions. A failed attempt at the CSA and the associated considerable expense of applying to sit the exam again had indeed taught him much.
Familiarity, however, did not make it any easier for Dr Cratchit to approach a man who never offered advice without showing contempt for the one who asked for it. For although Scrooge had received training on giving feedback, he had, much to the dismay of his appraiser, consistently failed to demonstrate any change in his behaviour as a result of such practice improving activity.
‘I was j-just wondering if it would be convenient if I were to g-go,’ Cratchit stammered. ‘I’m only supposed to do one clinical session today and, though the planned patch t-tutorial for this afternoon has been cancelled, I thought that, since you allocated me all the visits, you m-might let me skip off a little early this afternoon. It is Christmas after all and I would so appreciate having the extra time to be with m-my family.’
Scrooge glowered. ‘Of course it’s not convenient. And I don’t suppose you’ll be offering to work a couple of extra Saturday mornings in lieu of the day you’ll no doubt be taking off tomorrow. That’s the trouble with young doctors these days. No commitment.’
The ST3 smiled faintly and waited nervously.
‘Go on then, leave,’ Scrooge eventually conceded, ‘But if anything goes amiss this afternoon and I’m compelled to reflect on some significant event or another, I know where my reflections will lay the blame. Just make sure you’re in early on Thursday.’
Cratchit thanked Scrooge and slipped away, leaving the burnt out old clinician alone with his thoughts and the prospect of a three hour afternoon surgery.
As things turned out the rest of the day was mercifully quiet with Christmas Eve being the one afternoon of the year which provided the general population with something more interesting to do than seek medical advice regarding their minor health concerns. As a result, Scrooge locked up the practice early and arrived home before nine. He’d stopped on the way to pick up a bite to eat but, having consumed it en route, the only thing he had to look forward to on arriving back was, as most evenings, the prospect of going to bed.
As he got out of his car, a fog hung about the driveway of the old house that he’d bought some years before. Scrooge approached the front door, the fog seeming to cling to him as he walked. It was then that he noticed, in place of the ancient door knocker, what was clearly the face of his old partner, Dr Marley. The apparition lasted but a moment before Scrooge, unsettled by the sighting, hurried on, unlocking the door and subsequently forcing a pile of unsolicited medical periodicals to one side as he entered the house. He locked the door behind him and climbed the stairs to his bedroom.
Scrooge undressed and put on his night attire. As he sat gazing into the middle distance, contemplating once more the strange appearance of the door knocker, there came an unexpected ringing sound that filled him with inexplicable dread. Scrooge scrambled in his pocket for his phone. However, as the caller’s number was withheld, he, as was his custom, ignored what was almost certainly a nuisance call and continued his preparations for bed.
And then he saw it.
A sight that caused him to be more horrified than he’d ever been before – even more horrified than that morning when his appointments had included seven heart sink patients and three more complaining of being ‘tired all the time’. Before him, as unwelcome as critical emails from the head of Medicines Management, stood the ghost of Dr Jacob Marley.
Scrooge, nothing if not a man of reason, rose up and spoke to the spectre in an accusatory tone.
‘I don’t believe in you,’ he said.
‘You don’t believe in most NICE guidelines and yet they exist,’ countered the phantom.
‘That’s true,’ Scrooge was forced to concede and with that he sat back down in his chair. He paused a moment then, looking the ghost full in the face and acknowledging his existence, asked the reason for his visit.
‘I have come to warn you Ebenezer. There is yet a chance that you may escape what has become my fate. I am condemned to walk the earth for all eternity burdened by these chains – chains composed of nonsensical bureaucratic demands imposed on me by those who understand nothing of medicine and seek to use the profession for their own political ends. You have forgotten, Ebenezer, what being a doctor is really all about. You have forgotten the joy that your work once brought you and now you practise as a mere shadow of the clinician you once longed to be. You’re burnt out Ebenezer. Something needs to change.’
‘Blimey!’ said Scrooge, ‘like that’s going to happen.’
‘You will be haunted by three spirits,’ continued the ghost, ignoring Scrooge’s cynicism. ‘They will teach you all that you need to know. Without them you cannot hope to shun the path I now tread. Expect the first when the clock strikes one.’
And with that the ghost of Jacob Marley departed, groaning incoherent sounds of lamentation and dragging the weight of his chains behind him. Scrooge stood motionless for he knew not how long. Then, mindful of his need for rest, he climbed into bed. Picking up a copy of the BJGP, he fell asleep upon an instant.

BJGP Long Read: A valedictory note on my retirement
Posted by BJGP Life | 21 Feb 2020 | BJGP Long Read | 18
Claire Stillman is a recently retired GP who spent 30 years in Scottish general practice, the last 20 of which were in Glasgow.
About eight months ago I wrote an emotional, angry rant about why I was leaving general practice. It was in response to a questionnaire from the LMC asking me for reasons why I was going. I never sent it to them; it seemed enough to write everything down and it exhausted my anger. I kept meaning to go back to it but I never did, probably because it was too upsetting when I was in work and then it became irrelevant when I left. My emotion had been expended. Also, I felt that I had said nothing new. There were no blinding insights, other people had said the same things over and over and nothing had changed. It is hard to see how anything can change given the current structure and funding of the NHS. I should say that I took early retirement at the age of 59 following 30 years in General Practice and I might have taken a handful of days of sick leave in that time. I never took any time off for stress.
Here are the reasons I left, or perhaps some of them:
Appointments
The appointment system is not fit for purpose. A GP has to be all things to all people in 10 minutes only and this is untenable. In this time we have to deal with the polypharmacised multiply morbid patient who has several problems to discuss. We have to manage an increasing amount of clinical work transferred from secondary to primary care. We have to deal with the manipulative, the dangerous and the deluded. We have to deal with those with shopping lists of demands, the worried well, those sent by third parties for proof of just about anything. We have to deal with the longwinded, the demented, the unhappy, the angry. We have to deal with the worried parent and the sick child. We have to deal with the medical emergency or those who think it is an emergency. The list goes on. We are accessible to everyone, every single being has the right to walk in to discuss anything; there is no filter, no prior discussion to see whether a trip to a GP is appropriate or suitable.
We pay an emotional price for constant availability for everything the world throws at us.
GPs can be bullied and manipulated by a public who increasingly demand certainty and rights and a bureaucracy that seeks to medicalise social problems. In all this we have no support. We were trained to help others’ suffering, not manage our own. We pay an emotional price for constant availability for everything the world throws at us (and I mean everything), and a professionalism that is never acknowledged or meaningfully supported. We face the relentless expectations of the ten minute appointment, the constantly full waiting rooms, the unacceptable waiting times to be seen and feel constantly punished because we cannot meet them. I can honestly say that in all my time as a GP principle, I can count on one hand the times I did not have a fully booked surgery. Government policy, patient expectation, pressure on our staff mean that we are constantly in the wrong, on the back foot, for not delivering a service that, quite frankly, is impossible to provide. We are supposed to be made of teflon, have no feelings, cope with the relentless daily, monthly, yearly pressure of not delivering the impossibly perfect service that this society believes is their right.
Patient expectations
Expectations by patients have changed over my thirty years in practice. Society has changed; the consumer approach, the belief that everything should have an answer, the inability to accept the uncertainty of life and health; the belief that if something goes wrong someone must be to blame have all increased over time. Expectations increasingly fuelled by the unrealistic claims made on the internet. Also the idea that everyone should have instant access, instant answers, has grown. These expectations are not really compatible with what GPs do, namely manage uncertainty. Because of this GPs have been harried into increasing amounts of patient tests, often with no clear goal in mind and no evidence that it would be useful. On the contrary, tests breed insecurity and more tests, because doctors feel the need to cover themselves, to insure themselves against patients demanding ever more certainty. It is ironic that in an age when the population has never been more healthy or long lived, health uncertainty and anxiety increases. Adding to patient expectations is the medicalisation of human sadness. The belief that a doctor can make grief, sadness, the ordinary difficulties of life better with a pill or therapy seems to have increased steadily over the years.
Lack of resources
Mental health services were reason enough to leave general practice.
GPs are damned if they do and damned if they don’t. We are placed in impossible double binds by chronic NHS underfunding and then blamed for the outcomes. Classic examples are the exploitation of our gate keeping roles by saying we must refer less into secondary care and then blaming us for not diagnosing enough cancers. We are held responsible for not diagnosing the rarest of cancers, which have no characteristic sets of symptoms, and yet demonised or refused by secondary care if we refer patients like these in.
Mental health services were reason enough to leave general practice. The NHS in my area refused to fund or possibly organise an even half functioning service and given society’s propensity for medicalising any adverse human experience we were imprisoned in the ultimate double bind and for us it was a life sentence. Throughout my entire career I was supposed to deal with the mentally distressed in ten minute appointments with no credible back up. The media slammed us for handing out too many antidepressants giving the impression that we had any alternatives. Trust me, we did not. The stark choices for GPs dealing with mental distress ranging from overt psychosis to a little sadness were a prescription for a pill then and there and a bit more than ten minutes (thereby pressurising everyone else in the waiting room), or a referral for a mental health treatment, be it talking therapy or more assessment which might occur within the next 3 to 6 months. The icing on the cake was that despite a GP referral, the mental health service might decide, several weeks later, not to offer any treatment at all. Truly GPs backs are up against the wall when dealing with mental health problems, which on a conservative estimate, take up to 20% of their work. Indeed, there is a psychological component to all disease. Dealing with mental health services throughout my career was the most excruciating and depressing aspect of my job.
Another problem caused by underfunding, which inexorably worsened throughout my time in practice, was waiting times. This has caused the NHS to become cruel in its dealing with suffering patients. I have seen people with severe, debilitating, painful conditions having to wait up to a year to be seen in secondary care. And then they get sent for tests, have to wait months for their results, and then they have to wait further months for follow up in clinics to get the results of said tests. Hospital doctors never make decisions without panels of tests that seem to grow larger by the year. Meanwhile the GP is the only doctor a patient can directly access while waiting for all these events, the walls are very high around secondary care, and we are expected to manage their pain, anxiety and frustration with no power to change anything. As usual, there is no support for the GP managing the patient in this vacuum and the more compassionate the GP, the more likely they are to be broken by this powerlessness in the face of suffering.
Complexity
Patients are becoming increasingly complex. They live longer, are on more medication and often have two, three or even more co-existing conditions. We are expected to deal with their needs in ten minutes, or consider their problems in the little time we have between fire-fighting paperwork and results and managing the practice. Meanwhile secondary care is becoming more specialised with increasing numbers of silos. A patient goes to a hospital clinic where a specialist has the luxury of dealing with one condition only, with all the back up of a hospital department. And it can happen that the decision a specialist makes about the one condition that is their remit will have a knock on effect for the other conditions a patient might have. It is left to the GP to sort it out. A record achieved by one of my patients was that he visited seven different specialties on a regular basis, all of which dealt with one aspect of his care and none of which could come up with an overarching explanation for his symptoms. Needless to say I had ten minutes to deal with all of them. The use of protocols, guidelines and non-doctor vetting of secondary care referrals also lead to GP stress, not to say cruelty to the patient. The silos are getting narrower, secondary care clinicians are more and more empowered to say what they will not deal with . Meanwhile GPs have to deal with their rejections with no support for their suffering patients.
Polypharmacy
This is a real problem in the ten minute appointment. All evidence based medicine derives from studies on single conditions and all medication guidelines come from them. The problem is that very few patients have only one condition. The GP has to juggle co-prescribed medications with their multiplicity of interactions and side effects in each individual, very difficult in a busy surgery with a waiting room full of patients expecting to be seen on time. Ironically when the community pharmacists started to be involved in the Scottish NHS new contract, they stated they would need thirty minutes per patient. And a pharmacist would only be dealing with medications while the GP has to deal with the actual patient’s agenda, which may be something else entirely. Prescribing outwith the consultation has also become more onerous over the last few years as drug shortages and the increasing prescribing demands of secondary care have to be managed.
Poorly understood conditions/somatisation/chronic pain
Some of the hardest patients to deal with, the most time consuming and emotionally draining, are the ones that don’t fit into neat diagnostic boxes, yet constantly present with suffering and demand answers. These patients are not recognised by, and certainly not treated by secondary care. For example, those people with chronic pain for which we actually have no effective medication. Synthetic opiates, the only treatment out there, do not work and turn them into addicts. Any attempts at psychological reframing of their conditions are seriously resisted by the patients, and to be frank, the medical establishment.
There seems to be a belief that GP is elastic can continuously absorb extra work indefinitely.
The Cartesian dualism that bedevils our concepts of illness means that patients and many doctors think that the ultimate insult is to suggest that their suffering is ‘all in their head’ and for some strange reason does not then exist. Unfortunately GPs are faced with a number of patients who manifest their life distress with physical symptoms, call it somatisation for want of a better term, for whom existing medicine has no treatment and who become bitterly entrenched in their illness behaviour as they feel less and less cared for. The ‘fibromyalgics’, the chronically fatigued, for whom there is no realistic therapy and for which GPs have no training or support. I am not surprised that so many of them turn to snake oil salesman and quacks who at least provide them with attention before exploiting their vulnerabilities.
Outsourcing of secondary care work
Over the years, general practice has been subjected to a form of ‘mission creep’ with secondary care demanding that we increasingly do work that was originally done in hospital medicine. While it may seem reasonable that GPs manage new atrial fibrillation or perform near patient testing, this is added to our already increasing workload. There seems to be a belief that GP is elastic can continuously absorb extra work indefinitely. There is only so much work that we can take before we break.
Housebound patients
While home visit rates have gone down, housebound patients are becoming increasingly complex so that visits can resemble ward rounds in a geriatric hospital. Patients are often on medications and have conditions that need frequent monitoring and repeat visits that we are not resourced to manage. Latterly, I became increasingly concerned about our cohort of usually elderly, frail housebound patients on complex, potentially dangerous treatment regimes who were poorly managed in the community. General practice as it stands is just not equipped to deal with these people.
Conclusion
I think the chief thing to emphasise is that GPs stand alone, and are chronically under resourced. We may work in group practices and have our administration staff, but once the door is closed, it is just the GP and the patient in the room together. And in real time we have no support, indeed we have no formal support networks at all on the ground. There is no-one to catch us as we fall, we have no protection from the ire of the public, anger that is usually caused by a system that fails to deliver what has been promised. We stand and fall by the decisions we make in ten minutes and if things go wrong, the full weight of public and professional opprobrium lands on our heads. There is no safety net, no cavalry coming over the hill to relieve us.
Now, I have retired and I do not miss any of it. I was well thought of by my patients and staff to judge by the feedback I have received over the years and the overwhelming number of cards and presents I received when I retired. I also got on with and liked my partners. Yet a powerful emotion I associate with my time in general practice was one of failure. I had failed to deliver a good service and so now I am just relieved to be free of it. However, what does bother me is that I had a wealth of knowledge and skills, accumulated over lifetime, which I will never use again.
Yet there is no place for me now in my profession, general practice has lost my skills and those of all my retired peers completely.
And what does strike me is that perhaps my profession could benefit from my and my peers’ experience. I could perhaps mentor younger GPs, newly practising partners, and provide them with the support I never had. I can read a face, interpret its subtle movements, be aware of another’s suffering. I can listen actively and frame peoples’ stories empathetically and positively. I can pull out the essential points in a narrative, summarise a conversation, help someone form a plan for the future. I can listen. Yet there is no place for me now in my profession, general practice has lost my skills and those of all my retired peers completely. I feel that this is a shame as we are a resource that could be utilised for the good of the profession.
As for the future of general practice, I do not trust the Scottish NHS and the health boards to deliver the supposed new Scottish GP contract. They mouth platitudes but follow their own agendas rather than those of general practice, they have not trusted GPs to execute the changes and allocated funds seem to have dissipated in a plethora of talking shops and committees. It seems that the further you remove practitioners, the people who actually do the work, from decisions about how the work is done, the less successful the outcome. Unfortunately, GPs have been so busy actually doing their jobs, they have not had the time or emotional energy to fight for a new contract that works for them. I have little hope that the new contract will result in better experiences for patients or their doctors.
However, it can be argued that innovation, out of the box thinking comes from those without an interest in the system, so let’s throw the problem of how to run an NHS out there. Let all and sundry chew on it, because I don’t expect those within the system to come up with any answers. Lets hope someone has thought of something before the inevitable happens to me and I become a patient.

Thank you so very much for putting my sentiments down in such an eloquent way. I left my partnership in Glasgow recently aged 55 for the reasons you have outilined. I waited for the new contract and knew it was inadequate and resigned my partnership.
“the more compassionate the GP, the more likely they are to be broken by this powerlessness in the face of suffering”- this especially very much summed up my experience.
I now locum and feel more protected and distanced from the toxic work conditions expected of me by myself, patients, the NHS and the SG. I feel my experience of 30years as a doctor is wasted and I just have to suck it up and not dwell on it. That’s life! A shame when there is so much capacity of compassion and skill to give to people, given the right conditions.

Hi, given the current situation, perhaps we should view Active GP as something that you do for a finite time only, as part of a “portfolio career “ not a whole working lifetime. Rather you spend sometime at the frontline, then move onto less stressful jobs having done your bit. The question would be what to move on to that we have the skills and training for, apart from locum work. Also I think most people would agree that the more experienced the doctor the better practitioner they are. Always remembering that experience can just mean making the same mistakes with increasing confidence!

I also took early retirement from GP Partnership at 56 and have not regretted it. As I walked out of my surgery for the last time I almost literally felt a weight lifted from my shoulders. I share the author’s regret that I can’t continue to use the wisdom and experience gained over 30 years to help patients and relieve some of the burden from my younger colleagues.

Wow. Thank you for a brilliant, honest piece. I’m relatively early in my GP career and I recognise ALL of what you say. At the moment, the good outweighs the bad for me in GP, but I do wonder if I have the resilience to stay the distance. The lesson for me is: look after yourself and each other, because everyone else will milk you as dry as you let them.
I have saved this article for future reference and sharing. Thank you again.

I also took early retirement at 59 now nearly 7 years ago. This article describes my feelings too (OK in England not Scotland). I feel too that stopping work lifted a burden from me and regret at never being able to do the job to the best of my ability due to constant time pressure. The skills I gained in listening to my patients for over 30 years are no longer available to the NHS, as new less experienced doctors are assumed to be of equal value to the NHS. Bums on seats can be counted and that’s what appears to matter to those counting and making the rules.

Thanks for all your comments. Perhaps the RCGP should consider the mentoring idea! I refer to the comment I made above about limited stints at the front line. Sadly, in Scotland there is a shortage of new GPS and practices have had to shut up shop because of this. Clare

Clair, your comments eloquently outline the challenges and unreasonable demands placed on GP’s and 5 years ago I faced the same dilemma in my English practice of 30 years, and at 58 I too decided it was time to leave. I then decided to tackle a different challenge and moved to a much smaller remote and rural practice in the Hebrides as an NHS salaried partner. Surgeries and lists became smaller and I now have the luxury of time to spend with the patients and have the support of fabulous community staff. The experience and knowledge I’ve accumulated has been well used and I’ve truly enjoyed this final phase of my medical career, and I’m still working here
5 years later!
We are privileged to have the job we do, but time pressures can certainly prevent us giving our patients the service they deserve.

What a brilliantly written article. Comprehensively details why GP is failing and will likely not exist, at least in its current format, in the next 10-15 years. GP is the Walmart of medicine, pile them in, stack them high – all you can fit, anything and everything in a 10min appt. It is popular with politicians as they need cheap medicine by GPs to subsidise the expensive specialists and keep the tax payers happy with lower tax rates.
Unfortunately the real world is not like the Dr Who Tardis and time does not expand. GPs are human and to remain humane, we need to self care to avoid burnout. For some it will be time to boundary patients, for others it will be time to cut back on sessions and and for many it is time to look for alternative careers. I used to look at GPs as a child in the 1980s with deep respect and awe, they had status and commanded respect from their peers. These times no longer exist. Now each day is a battle for many if not most. I left the NHS year ago and will not return, I wish those of you who remain the best.

This has been one of the best short reads describing what GP life has become and I can’t disagree with any of it. Strange thing is, like the Gp reply above, who moved to a small rural practice , and enjoying his last 5 years, I too have honestly rarely ever had a bad day in my 30 years as a GP partner now aged 58 Wales. Small personalised list 2750 (weighted list 3500) in a 2 person (1.5fte) so 4 day week. The single biggest reason I remain happy and peaceful in the midst of the plethora of issues you so eloquently describe is for me they all become so much milder/manageable/solvable when there is someone who armed with a life time knowledge of their small 1300-1500 patients characters, expectations and illnesses, finds decisions and tests ,mail and the whole lot becomes quicker easier, more thorough.Its not that I am not busy ,it’s just not always busy. It’s not that I am better as I am not.
From what I see and hear in the profession generally, I can’t see a sustainable way forward for Primary care unless we rapidly move to personalised lists, yes in group partnerships supported by HCSW/Nurses/PA/admin . I mean where you are solely responsible for your own patients, not someone else’s,not strangers,not patients who try and manipulate new GPs. Yes seek 2nd opinions occasionally, Expect yes a day off each week where similar partner /colleagues cover any emergencies.No long waits to be seen . Telephone first less necessary, “Rubbish“ I hear some think,but I maintain it is all very possible because my experience is the time saving and in depth supervision by one GP of an almost totally “known” population really does yield the time and space to let us cope,grow and even thrive.
Most complex illnesses become less stressful as you have been with them through it all and know them almost as well as they do. Your previous consultation laid out the actions you would do if they returned. Ten minutes often plenty bar the first new complex illness, no more long history taking by talented GPs who have little knowledge of the patient multiplied a thousand times a year .Less mental stress and clinician anxiety.
Add in HCSW, social Prescribing and decent mental health services and it become a real pleasure and something even at 58 I don’t wish to give up.
Planning 2 days a week till 65.
You asked for a solution. There it is. Not meant to be Patronising. Personalised lists where you and only you ,95% of the time have to make the decisions that will affect your workplace tomorrow and next week Is the way ahead. .Claire, please don’t stay away, seek a small practice as you are incredibly valuable. As for me I am planning 2 days a week till 65.

I am a 50 year old GP working in North West England. I could not agree more with everything that is written in this article. I am a very robust individual and continue to work as a Partner in a large practice with great colleagues. However I have seen many very good people “broken” (alcoholism, Depression, burn out) by the toxic environment of General Practice.Good UK GPs are some of the finest and hard working General Physicians in the world. In the last 10 years I have come to the conclusion that the NHS is not fit for purpose in the current world and never will be. The sooner the NHS becomes a private insurance based service then the sooner GPs will be able to control their workload / quality of care and lead a full rewarding working life that does not “break them”.

Clair, what a beautifully written article.
Thank you.
Last year I initiated the project “Rediscover the Joy of General Practice” https://www.srmc.scot.nhs.uk/joy-project/
It is specifically designed for GPs like you coming up for retirement but who feel they have more to give, but not under the pressures you describe.
It began as a collaboration between NHS Orkney, Shetland, Western Isles and Highland and this year has expanded to include other Scottish Health Boards.
It is based on work undertaken in Orkney over the last 10 years.
We offer contracts of between 6-18+ weeks/year to undertake practice attachments for periods of 1-4 weeks at a time. Travel from a Scottish city and accommodation is paid for, meaning that GPs do not need to relocate.
Our philosophy is based on supporting the practices and staff in all aspects of GP work and quality improvement.
Have a look at the website to understand the scheme more fully.
In 2019 we recruited 33 GPs to our Rural GP Support Team, many were retiring GPs who have felt reinvigorated by working with us.
This year we have expanded the scheme to involve the whole of Scotland and not just rural practices.
Currently we have shortlisted a further 35 GPs.
Although we have officially closed, we will still accept late applications and will reopen to applications again once we have established this second team.
What is interesting is that as our team expands and develops we suddenly find that we have the opportunity to consider how we can tackle what previously seemed intractable problems.
All members of the team are encouraged to contribute their ideas of how we could tackle thorny issues and due to the phenomenal depth of experience and expertise among our GPs we find ourselves in an unusually empowered position.
The project is led by the Primary Care Associate Medical Directors and Managers from the participating Health Boards and has the full backing of the Scottish Government.
We are at an early stage and certainly do not have all the answers, but we are determined to try and make a difference.
Working together with vision, determination and lateral thinking I believe we can make real changes – however, I am a self-confessed irresponsible optimist!
Anyone interested, do have a look at the website and please feel free to join us.
Claire, I would very much like to have a chat with you and to explore some of your ideas.
My email is charles.siderfin@nhs.net

The stressed but not ‘mentally ill’: How can we actually help?
Posted by BJGP Life | 23 Sep 2019 | Clinical | 0
Rosie Marshall is a GP based in Wiltshire.
General practice routinely involves supporting patients presenting with diverse manifestations of stress. This can be a challenging issue for clinicians to manage because by definition there are underlying circumstances (sometimes related to complex and systemic problems, often beyond the scope of the individual) that ultimately need to be changed, and of course we have no magic wand for this. This can feel, to me, like an elephant in the consultation room. Where presentations appear to be an understandable and rational reaction to challenging circumstances, are standard medical approaches to mental illness the best way forward or do we need to expand our skill set?
Caused by material or existential factors, stress is of course inevitable in life. When our coping resources are exceeded by prolonged or high impact exposure, the potential impacts can be profound, including severe mental as well as physical illness. But not every stressed person is suffering from mental illness. It is unsurprising that the issue sparks confusion when the specialists are still in dispute about what mental illness is. Publication of the American Psychiatric Association’s revised DSM-5 in 2013 stirred considerable controversy, with many in the psychiatry and psychology worlds arguing that diagnostic criteria were being lowered to the point of incorporating part of the normal spectrum of human emotional life. All but the severest manifestations of stress will likely be encountered by GPs rather than psychiatrists (if the patient presents to a medical professional at all), and we are unlikely to spend time agonising over categorisation systems. From a practical perspective, we know there is a complicated relationship between wellness/illness and the presence or absence of symptoms.
It can still be difficult to differentiate between a ‘normal’ response, and mental illness, being subjective even within one cultural context.
In the current version of ICD-10, ‘stress’ occurring in the absence of a singular crisis-level event would fall under adjustment disorder. This is defined as a state of emotional disturbance arising from a significant life change or stressful event. The DSM-5 definition of adjustment disorder specifies that the distress present is out of proportion to the severity of the stressor and beyond cultural expectations of a normal response. Similar to the contentious issue of bereavement, it can still be difficult to differentiate between a ‘normal’ response, and mental illness, being subjective even within one cultural context. This can feel more like an art than a science.
Outside the diagnostic remit of adjustment disorder (or PTSD/acute stress reaction), stress seems to be a grey area in terms of management guidelines, although numerous mental health charities are (quite rightly) telling individuals to visit their GP when stressed. The question is, when people come seeking help, what tools do we have to offer meaningful assistance, rather than a ‘band-aid’ approach to managing the symptoms of stress? I am not proposing to offer management guidance but rather consideration of the issue.
Identifying a stressor and fixing it to alleviate symptoms may present a straightforward process. More often, finding a solution is complicated and may feel unachievable. Attempting to directly confront the challenges in an individual’s reality can seem uncomfortable or inappropriate because we know it is not necessarily easy for them to actually make changes. Their agency will often be limited by numerous material and psycho-social factors, some well beyond their own or anybody’s control, and changing habitualised behaviour is difficult. Additionally as we witness daily, life is inherently complex and reality may be elusive in the formulation of internal narratives and perceptions. In the telling of our own life stories, our memories are curiously malleable. What is lacking or dysfunctional may be readily apparent to an observer but insight cannot simply be delivered: it is best gained through a process of self-discovery requiring motivation and time.
Where there is an ongoing stressor with no likely beneficial outcome, ultimately the need for change has to be recognised and then actually acted upon by the patient, if action is possible. Motivational interviewing techniques may help to facilitate this, although these require practice and finesse. Psychological therapy can be incredibly helpful in guiding patients through a process of self-realisation, enabling them to identify key underlying issues and think about how they might be able to alter their circumstances or strengthen their coping mechanisms. It is likely to be most successful when appropriately individualised.
In some situations where a stressful event has been and gone, time will be the ultimate healer and reassurance enough (of course not in cases of PTSD). Exercise, nutrition, green spaces and mindfulness may well help with stress management and are always a good idea for general wellbeing, but may in many circumstances be unlikely to represent a cure for stress unless underlying issues are addressed. This is equally the case for alternative or complementary therapies. If a stressor is worth enduring for the likely resultant benefits, or circumstances are unalterable, then of course all of these approaches might be worth considering to make life more manageable, depending on context and preferences.
Receiving treatment may facilitate avoidance of confronting the emotional complexity and messiness of ‘normal life’.
It can be difficult to know whether an individual is likely to benefit from medication. For some it will, of course, be entirely appropriate and beneficial. Medication may appear an attractive fix to the ‘worried well’ and persuading them it is not necessarily the answer can prove challenging. My general assumption is that if there are not symptoms of an underlying depression or anxiety disorder, then antidepressants are unlikely to help (short of a placebo effect). If an individual does try an antidepressant and benefits from a placebo effect, they may lose faith in medical help when the effect inevitably dissipates.
Conversely, if the source of stress resolves and they feel better, they may attribute the improvement to the antidepressant and believe it is the answer in future. Many patients try various medications over time, and instead of finding a more satisfying job, or leaving their dismissive partner, they come back asking what they can try next. Receiving treatment may facilitate avoidance of confronting the emotional complexity and messiness of ‘normal life’. As stated by T.S. Eliot, ‘Human kind cannot bear very much reality’. Medication is turned to readily by doctors (even diazepam, which is surely comparable to prescribing alcohol), but this is somewhat understandable in view of the complexities described above, when we have ten (or fifteen) minutes and are likely to be somewhere on the stress spectrum ourselves.
Fit notes may be a helpful way to communicate with a patient’s place of employment, if work is a source of stress. However, surely in many circumstances the patient should first be encouraged to attempt a communication with their work in order to avoid fostering unnecessary dependence. Weighing up the risks and benefits of time off work can be difficult. It may offer a period of genuinely needed respite and reflection and time to action change. However, if nothing changes during the interim and the patient spends their time in an agony of worry about returning to a mountain of catch-up and all the same stresses, then it seems an unproductive strategy. We all know that prolonged periods off work can contribute to a deterioration in mental health: occupation or meaningful pursuit is a human need.
Some patients may live in a seemingly constant state of stress regardless of circumstances or treatment, for example due to personality traits related to complex background factors. This is not to cast judgement, but understanding that this is their norm may facilitate a more productive working relationship.
Should we have more training in the basics of life coaching or psychological therapy?
GPs are no longer paternalistic advisors and we have not trained as life coaches, counsellors or psychotherapists, but we may feel called into these roles by some patients. It leads me to wonder, what is our role here? Importantly of course we need to try to identify those who are ‘mentally ill’, those at risk of harm, or those who would benefit from medication. But beyond this? Sending everybody for psychological therapy seems like the best way to rapidly render the psychological therapy service unserviceable due to infeasible waiting times. Should we have more training in the basics of life coaching or psychological therapy? We are of course unlikely to achieve any level of mastery of these subjects, when they are themselves vast areas of professional expertise and we already have quite enough on our plates to deal with as medical generalists. Nor is a 10 minute GP consultation the right medium for these practices.
The self-help industry is booming, with an astonishing diversity of books, podcasts and apps available. Some of these represent high quality, valuable resources for the motivated. However, quality is hugely variable, many are not evidence-based and some can lead down dubious paths. Highly contradictory advice may be offered, and an individual may not know which area of self-care would be beneficial to explore without starting with a certain degree of insight. Should we be delving into this realm? But again, how can we become acquainted with and critically appraise this immense and constantly evolving bank of work, and condense the best contributions into an efficiently deliverable and individualised format?
Perhaps the elephant in the room is that rather than accessing some store of medical knowledge to support a stressed patient, I am falling back on my own common sense and personal experience and this does not feel legitimate: it can trigger my imposter syndrome and make me feel stressed.
An awareness that our ability to help is extremely limited can cause feelings of inadequacy and frustration, which can contribute to burn-out. Perhaps we should be embracing our limitations and admit that we do not currently have the answer to curing the underlying stressors of modern life. We must carefully avoid the transference of worry onto our own shoulders: we are truly not responsible for our patients’ difficulties or life choices, although we can offer concern. If nothing else in the intractable cases, what we can take pride in offering is a listening ear, compassion and validation, and through this the possibility of human connection.

I’ll miss this when we are gone
Posted by Peter Aird | 19 Aug 2019 | Opinion | 1
Peter Aird is a GP in Bridgwater, Somerset.
There’s a scene in Stan and Ollie, the film about Laurel and Hardy when towards the end of the film, Hardy says to Laurel: “I’ll miss this when we’re gone”. He speaks the words, indicating his eagerness to finish the show with the dance routine that, due to his heart disease, he knows, from a solely medical point of view, he is unwise to perform.
Oliver Hardy knows it’s not just his career with Stan Laurel that is drawing to a close – it’s also his life. What he chooses to do though is not simply based upon the notion that one should live only for the moment. Mindful of the future, the sadness he will feel, and recalling the past, the joy he has known, he makes a decision in the present. Hoping not to be left with the sadness of regret – he dances.
It’s a bittersweet moment. The sadness is extenuated by the joy, the joy extenuated by the sadness. It made me smile – as I cried.
It reminded me of four things:
1. Good advice is sometimes best ignored
There are some things more important than one’s health – the value of a life is not measured by its length. In our efforts to extend life we must not deprive our patients the opportunity to live. Sometimes we need to say to our patients that they’d be well advised to pay no heed to what we doctors tell them. And we sometimes have to be wise enough to ignore conventional medical wisdom and deliberately fail to pass it on.
2. The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.
Following guidelines may make us all feel safer, they risk leaving us trapped in a very small corner of the here and now.
Neither we, nor our patients, need yet more guidelines focusing in on every symptom that is experienced with the demand that each is managed perfectly. Though following guidelines may make us all feel safer, they risk leaving us trapped in a very small corner of the here and now. Too much attention to problems can give them undue prominence in our consciousness and risks diminishing our lives more than is necessary. This is even more true when the problems are only risk factors – that is, merely potential problems. Similarly, neither we nor our patients need any more spurious health scares. Though, as a consequence, undertaking a precipitous and wholesale change to our medical practice may give us a momentary sense of satisfaction that current advice is being followed, we will be left too busy to alter the things that genuinely matter today and thus delay any movement towards a truly better tomorrow. We need to keep in mind the bigger picture and focus on what’s most important. Colluding with patients that with the right combination of pills and careful attention to lifestyle death will be avoided is dishonest and, as Oliver Hardy perhaps understood, detrimental to all our chances of enjoying the life we have now.
3. Contradictory emotions can be experienced simultaneously
We can not deny the existence of sadness – on the contrary its inevitability is universal. Furthermore, we cannot know what happiness really is without knowing the pain of sorrow – and sorrow requires the memory of the temporary nature of happiness. If, then, we are to be happy, it must be alongside our sadness. We dare not wait for the absence of sorrow before allowing ourselves to be happy. It is not that we can not be happy because we know sadness, nor that we can not be sad because there are things to be happy about. Paradoxically, we can be happy and sad at the same time. Life isn’t merely about being happy. We can smile – even as we cry.
Similarly we can have a healthy appreciation of life despite serious ill health. We can live well, maybe even dance, despite our approaching death. Life is not black or white, it’s a kaleidoscope of grey. We would do well to see the light in the darkness.
4. We need hope.
Medicine must stop trying to be the solution to the problems for which it is not the answer.
Unlike Oliver Hardy, too many people won’t miss this life when they’re gone. Merely keeping people alive and healthy shouldn’t be our sole concern. Nobody for whom the highlight of their day is a bottle of scotch, a packet of fags and a fried chicken meal will adopt healthy lifestyles no matter how much we bully them to do so. We need to consider the future rather than be obsessed with the present. Such patients need to be given the hope of better lives – lives that will be missed – lives which might just motivate the healthy living that will enable such lives to be more fully enjoyed.
Rather than offering answers that won’t work, and adding to the futility that all too many experience, medicine must stop trying to be the solution to the problems for which it is not the answer. Being encouraged to constantly look inward at ourselves is the opposite to what is needed if we are to enjoy the fulfilled lives we hope we’ll live. More than a fourth antihypertensive or a third line statin, to be happy we need to be valued as members of local communities, undertake worthwhile work and enjoy meaningful connections with others. We need to know what it is to love and be loved. That is all of society’s responsibility, and though that too may be a vain hope, I for sure need one that’s even better still, it is at least preferable than hoping solely in ourselves.
At work, to keeps us going in hard times, we need also the hope that our practices will continue to be communities which provide such opportunities. They need to remain small enough to allow relationships between both staff and patients to develop over time in ways that just aren’t possible in large anonymous organisations. Staying reasonably small enables us to notice and appreciate others even as we are noticed and appreciated ourselves. Lose this and we will find we have gotten ourselves into another nice mess. And so, for as long as I am privileged to be able to continue to practice in the way I do now, in a supportive partnership looking after personal lists, I’m not looking to leave or reduce my commitments any time soon.
Because, I guess, ‘I’ll miss this when we’re gone’
Now if only I could dance.

Peter – you have encapsulated the last 40 years of my own thoughts in this brilliant post!
Quote of the year: “Nobody for whom the highlight of their day is a bottle of scotch, a packet of fags and a fried chicken meal will adopt healthy lifestyles no matter how much we bully them to do so. ”
best wishes, David

The Bravest Decision
Posted by BJGP Life | 6 Dec 2017 | Undergraduate | 0
Chloe Webster is a 4th year medical student, a yogaholic, creative writing enthusiast, and an aspiring future GP.
I was just absentmindedly skimming through some patient notes, pushing paperwork for a research study, and there it was. In black and white – an advanced directive. My mind just stopped. I re-read the words as if my eyes were playing tricks on me, but the words still remained. An often unspoken part of the world of medicine. The end of life. I was shocked, to say the least, to see this documented in the notes of a young and well patient. The cogs of my mind started turning. Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. Is a DNACPR the bravest decision that we can make? To truly take life in to our own hands, and make the ultimate choice between life and death
The discussion of DNACPR is never easy. Having a close relative arrest in her thirties, and then be resuscitated, has changed my thought process. Are we playing God? Are we bringing people back to life? My mother and I have undoubtedly had this discussion. With a close family member affected, and my role as a CPR trainer, it’s something which we have freely talked about over the years. Today got me thinking. Often, we associate DNACPR with those who are terminally ill, the old, the frail, the weak hospital patients. We never think about those who are young, or well in themselves.
But she’s my mum. The time may come when she is close to death, and I would never want her to suffer anymore.
Although not 100% fit and well having had two rounds of life-changing surgery, my relatively young mother in her forties has already decided her answer to the ‘Big Question’. She wouldn’t want to be ‘brought back’ as it were. As a medic, and loving daughter, it pains me to think that she would die, and that would be it. But she’s my mum. The time may come when she is close to death, and I would never want her to suffer anymore.
It pains me further to think of someone beating down on her chest, potentially breaking ribs in the attempt to put life back in to her suffering body. DNACPR should not be seen as an easy way out, nor giving up on life. Although so well designed, the human body isn’t perfect. Things can go wrong; our health can take over. Sometimes all that is needed is the courage to say no to suffering through living, and accept death.
I think my mum, like so many others, like the patient today, have made the bravest decision of them all.

Inspiring healthy lives
Posted by BJGP Life | 25 Oct 2019 | Opinion | 0
Rachel Handscombe is a GP partner in Derbyshire. She is an activity enthusiast and is keen to share the benefits of exercise to those she meets.
I wore my 100 parkrun t-shirt to work today. I was curious as to what my patients would say. Rarely a week passes by without some comment about my weight or fitness. I greet my patients in the waiting room and walk the 15 metres or so to my room. I take ‘no wonder you are so fit’ or ‘you must walk miles in a day’ to be a bad prognostic marker. My favourite comment has been ‘you’ll cop it when you reach the menopause!’ So it was a surprise and a bit of a disappointment that no-one really seemed to notice.
My Facebook thread is scattered with posts from Joe Wicks and Rangan Chatterjee – amongst others. There are clips of different strengthening exercises, photos on the beach, adventures in the wild and a general portrayal of wellbeing. Maybe we too, could live satisfied, healthy lives if we followed what they do? Which makes me wonder how much of a role model are we as clinicians at the forefront of primary care? If we ‘advertised well-being’ or showed a little more of how we aim to live healthier lives, would that inspire our patients? Should I respond with more that a shrug and a smile when patients believe that a little walk to and from the waiting room is enough to keep me fit and well?
I bounded into a practice meeting, grinning from ear to ear about the ‘takeover’ parkrun event which I was organising.
I love the parkrun practice initiative. My experience is that exercise has vastly improved my health, my confidence, my sense of adventure, my friendships and my general levels of happiness. Did I mention the positive effects it’s had on helping me manage my stress? I’d go so far as to say I am evangelical about a bit of exercise. So it came as no surprise to my colleagues when I bounded into a practice meeting, grinning from ear to ear about the ‘takeover’ parkrun event which I was organising. My excitement levels were soon dampened when the majority of my team freely admitted that 5km – run or walk was really just a little out of their comfort zones.
I wish I’d had the ideas and drive of Paul Sinton-Hewitt – the founder of parkrun. I am astounded by the impact he has had on the wellbeing of our nation(1). He has to be one of the most awesome health heroes of our time. My local parkrun has just celebrated its 10th birthday. There’s an average weekly attendance of 440 runners and over the last 10 years those runners have collaboratively run over a million kilometres. The average number of parkruns done by each runner is 8.9 so there must be something about parkrun that keeps people coming back for more. A staggering intervention but one that still seems so out of reach for many.
As a response to the disappointing turnout for my inaugural takeover parkrun, I have started a local couch to 5km (C25K) running group. There’s a brilliant C25K app that is free and takes participants from being able to run for a minute to being able to run continuously for 30 minutes. It’s a step up to being able to run 5km and after the nine-week course most of my C25K participants have proudly completed their first 5km- at the local parkrun. Hopefully many will now be embraced by the local parkrun community. My hope is that many will continue to run and experience for themselves the health benefits of exercise.
Many times, I’ve prescribed medication or referred for operations without really discussing lifestyle.
Many patients come to me looking for a ‘magic pill’ to make themselves feel better. Many times, I’ve prescribed medication or referred for operations without really discussing lifestyle. We have 1200 pre-diabetics in our practice. Each year we take their BMI, their BP and their Hbaic. Within a year, 5 to 10% of these patients are likely to be diabetic (3). On turning diabetic we start them on metformin. It’s not surprising that as physicians, we too are looking for a ‘magic pill’ – something that we can give to make a change within the time and financial constraints of our consultations. But ‘lifestyle intervention is the cornerstone of diabetes prevention with evidence of a 40-70% relative risk reduction’ (2).
So what if we did something differently? What if we inspired a new way of living? Instead of measuring decline could we refer our patients into a practice led C25K? Could each practice team take an hour out of their week to run – to improve their own health, but also to inspire and provide an accessible level of exercise and belonging into which patients can be embraced? Joe Wicks has turned his 1.9 million Instagram followers into a fitness empire. Rangan Chatterjee has sold over 200,000 books on living a healthier life. Perhaps it’s time to put on our trainers and role model a healthier way to live?
Now where is that parkrun t-shirt?

Writing for the BJGP – Beyond Research
Posted by Euan Lawson | 4 Jun 2018 | BJGP News | 0
Euan Lawson is the Deputy Editor of the BJGP.
One of the aspects of the BJGP that has always been appreciated by readers is that we publish a lot of writing about primary care and the profession that goes beyond research.
In the BJGP we have editorials and we have more traditional medical education articles such as those featured in Clinical Intelligence. We have Debate & Analysis pieces but we also accept more personal writing that covers the experience of primary care.
We also publish articles on everything beyond the consulting room and we have always reached into areas such as book and film reviews, arts, theatre and exhibitions. And, of course, we do opinion and polemic. They are all welcome. Nowadays, they are found in the Life & Times section of the BJGP but we have other options as well now.
We’ve summarised these so that if you have a hankering to write for us you will have a better idea of where to focus your efforts.
Print BJGP – Life & Times: www.bjgp.org
The Life & Times section of the print journal is familiar to many people. It has, in the past, been known simply as the Back Pages and it has been through a period as Out of Hours. All articles in the print journal, including Life & Times (L&T), will be indexed on Pubmed but articles for L&T are not generally peer-reviewed in the same way as research articles and editorials.
In order to meet the requirements to fit on a page we generally need articles for L&T to be 600-700 words long. There is some flexibility but we like to use images in the print journal and we need some space in which to add them.
We like book reviews to be 300-350 words when possible although some reviews will be 600-700 words long. We do publish longer essays on occasions. Typically, lengths of 1200-1400 words will then fit. It’s worth mentioning that our preference is to stick to single-page articles in the majority of cases.
If you are aware of a local exhibition or event that could be of interest then get in touch. We may be able to use a review.
We are fortunate enough to receive more submissions than we can publish in the print journal. We are always happy to consider any article but if you do stray far beyond these limits it does make it harder for us to use it.
BJGP Life: www.bjgplife.com
We also have a blog and website where we publish articles that are better suited to an online medium. Sometimes that is because they are time sensitive and topical. The print journal, the main BJGP, is a monthly publication and that does result in a modest lag to publication. Even if we had absolutely no articles in the pipeline and we pushed a piece into the next available issue it could be several weeks before it is printed and distributed. More commonly we are working 2-3 issues down the line for articles that are not time-sensitive.
BJGP Life gives us the opportunity to publish articles that are of immediate interest to our readers. In addition, there is an open-ended option with word count. We’ve had some excellent ‘Long Reads’ – check out Stanley Jeff’s piece as a good example. That said, in our experience many longer pieces are often much better as shorter articles. It’s the old case of Pascal’s Apology: “I’m sorry that this was such a long letter, but I didn’t have time to write you a short one”.
A good length for an article on BJGP Life is much the same as the print journal – 600-900 words works well. Importantly, BJGP Life also gives us the chance to publish multiple images, videos, audio and use media more creatively. We simply can’t do that with the print journal. Articles on BJGP Life will not be indexed on Pubmed. That said, we may well be able to publish a short version in the print BJGP and a longer version, perhaps with multi-media, on BJGP Life. We are very happy to consider this as an option when suitable.
Regular bloggers
We do have a number of people who write regularly. We’d be delighted to hear from anyone else who is interested in getting involved. Get in touch and let us know.
BJGP Open: www.bjgpopen.org
The BJGP has now launched BJGP Open. BJGP Open is an international, peer reviewed, open access, online-only journal of primary care, which publishes original research and other articles of importance to primary care clinicians, researchers and teachers worldwide. BJGP Open publishes research articles and full details for authors considering submitting research can be found here. BJGP Open will also publish Practice & Policy articles with a much reduced article processing charge. These should be 800-1000 words long and can cover a range of areas.
Practice & Policy articles could include case reports and we are very interested in international reports that describe interesting and important clinical, health policy, and medico-political developments and initiatives, designed to highlight aspects of primary health care around the globe and to generate discussion and debate.
Submitting articles
The best way to submit articles for the BJGP including L&T and BJGP Open is via the online submission system on the individual websites.
You will be able to ignore many of the boxes as they are only applicable to full research papers but it does ensure we have the important details and appropriate COIs etc recorded.
If you are interested in writing for the BJGP Life website then drop us an email via the feedback form or contact journal@rcgp.org.uk.

The Affordable Care Act and USA Healthcare: Reaping the Whirlwind
Posted by BJGP Life | 21 Jun 2016 | BJGP Long Read, International, Opinion, Political | 0
Professor John Frey III is now retired from the University of Wisconsin Department of Family Medicine and Community Health but is still an active teacher, research collaborator, journal editor and ‘faculty whisperer’ about career transitions at all stages of professional life (a free service but you have to buy lunch). He lives most of the year in Santa Fe New Mexico but also part time Madison Wisconsin.
United States presidential elections are ridiculously expensive, far too drawn out, and provide an enormous amount of money for the media consultants to try to convince voters – or more likely scare them – into one position to the other. It is hard to imagine what the initial Republican Clown Car full of candidates must have looked like to the rest of the world. Culling them to a single individual has not helped all that much. Why those who suffer adverse effects from social determinants of health such as poverty, social isolation, family dissolution and low educational achievement continue to vote against their own interests and are attracted to a jingoist real estate developer and ‘small government’ libertarians has been and will be a subject of continuing analysis. Twentieth century history had lots of examples of dangerous demagoguery and likely so will the 21st.
The current situation seems to say “experience and ideas and policy don’t matter, only generalized anger”. Health care always comes up in the Republican debates as “get rid of Obamacare” as I have mentioned previously, with nothing to replace it.[1] Donald Trump infuriates the Republicans by not following the party line on health care and seemingly wants not only to keep the Affordable Care Act (ACA) but improve it in some way that he seems reluctant to describe. But Trump’s daily policy swings assure only that whatever he says he would do will likely turn out to be something else. Health care is more central in the Democratic duo, framed as a ‘pragmatist’ who can get improvements to the Affordable Care Act done versus an ‘idealist’ who advocates a national health system run by government. Having worked hard to help create two Democratic Pyrrhic victories – Eugene McCarthy in 1968 which helped elect Richard Nixon and George McGovern in 1972 which assured a repeat victory by Nixon – I personally am not anxious to stick to the purity of progressive beliefs and bring the world President Trump. Despite different visions of progress in health care, there has been movement, with Secretary Clinton suggesting permitting some people who are still working to enroll in Medicare – the program for elderly and disabled – as an addition to the ACA.
Meanwhile, the ACA moves on to insure more and more people, with the percentage of uninsured now at its lowest point in history. Young people were supposed to be the low risk participants that would offset the high risk pool, and that has happened to a great extent, although not at the levels that the government had hoped. To their credit, young people realize that having health insurance actually frees them to experiment with jobs and careers that don’t carry health benefits. As a result they are busier than ever with entrepreneurial startups and small businesses which are the life blood of society. Not tying health insurance to a job has had a positive effect on what has been labeled the ‘gig economy’ – freelancing and session work controlled by the person rather than the company. If an insured young person in the gig economy breaks a leg, it won’t mean that they have to go live with their parents because they are bankrupt. There has also not been the predicted disconnect between work-related health care as a benefit which has been the foundation of US health insurance. Companies still offer it to most employees, in part because it is a large tax deduction that industry does not want to lose and also because there is renewed competition for workers as the economy speeds up. Private coverage was declining before the ACA was passed but appears to have leveled off. While a substantial victory for the forces of good, the ACA has exposed other problems with the way Americans think about health care and have infused our culture since the mid-20th century.
Two historic cultural problems:
Insurance companies are our friends and protectors
The reforms that had led to a five year leveling off of the cost of health care in the US are now starting to be threatened by two themes that are deeply ingrained in the US psyche: first, the belief that private insurance rather than the government works in the best interests of the people and, second, that getting something for ‘free’ will create an overuse of health services by patients. These two beliefs were sowed in the wind of public opinion back in the mid-20th Century and now the country is reaping the whirlwind. While the rest of the economically developed world adapts health systems to a changing society, the US remains stuck in 75 year old arguments.
The fact that private insurance companies compensate hospitals and physicians and pay for drugs for claims submitted to Medicare always comes as a surprise to the public – and sometimes to physician colleagues. Private insurance companies are contracted as ‘fiscal intermediaries’ for state and federal governments to manage programs like Medicare and Medicaid, for the elderly and the poor. The public has the image of an office building of government bureaucrats in green eyeshades and quill pens in Washington writing checks for over a trillion dollars to health care providers. But these contracts with private insurers limit the percentage of management fees the insurance companies can charge. Allowing ‘only’ a 4% overhead charge to manage Medicare may seem restrictive compared to the up to 20% overhead allowed by the ACA that companies can charge for private plans for the ironically titled ‘medical-loss ratio’ which treats payments for medical care as a ‘loss’ to insurance companies. But because there are more than 55 million of us on Medicare and growing daily, the billions of dollars that insurance companies get yearly to manage a straightforward program with minimal complexity is not so shabby.
But, despite a great deal of research to the contrary,
the public still feels that private insurance companies with high overheads and deceptive practices deliver better quality care than government programs. The Republican Party takes advantage of that belief to denigrate Medicare and Medicaid and the ACA and threaten to turn those programs to the private sector. (Sound familiar?) Not coincidentally the Republicans receive a great deal of money from insurance companies and present no alternative to the ACA other than ‘trust the insurance companies rather than the government’.
On the Democratic side, Senator Sanders picks up on one element of the progressive agenda which started in the late 1940s with President Truman and dwells on the ‘single payer’ mantra which, like so many other sound bites, is not really understood even by those who advocate for it.[2] The problem with ‘single payer’ is that, unless there is a rapid realignment of payment toward primary care and a change from the fee-for-service, production model which dominates US health care, it really would rapidly bankrupt the system. Ontario, in the Canadian single payer system, has moved most of its primary care to a capitated model and salaried service in part because of the strains of fee-for-service care but even with that change, continues to struggle with the right governance and accountability.[3]
In many ways, the whole debate for this presidential election threatens to be a war of sound bites, ‘single payer’ on the left vs. ‘end Obamacare’ on the right with neither party having the skills or the American people having the patience to actually understand what those phrases mean. And no one is discussing the 30 million Americans – the young, the low income families, and the undocumented workers who remain without health insurance.
While ‘universal coverage’ may mean what it says, it may have an asterisk next to it saying “except the 11 million undocumented workers who live here now and who we would like to ignore”. No one wants to have a serious conversation about immigrants at any level.
Being insured yet with ‘out of pocket’ expenses:
I have a photo from a collection from the National Archives of photos taken during the 1930s that shows a general practitioner sitting at his desk with a stern look on his face and a sign that reads ‘Consultations: Cash Only’. While one might be amused by the 80 year old photo, offices and hospitals are more subtle about it now but still demand payment from the patient, even if the patient has health insurance. ‘Co-pay’ and ‘deductible’ are the terms used these days for the portion of the bill patients must pay and are among the more maddening aspects of US health economics. Patients who have to make frequent visits may have $40 charges for each visit in addition to their insurance and so patients with chronic diseases which require frequent monitoring can quickly run up bills that keep them away even though they are ‘insured’. Drug costs are another example. I am on an anticoagulant for which I had a ‘co-pay’ of $15/month for the past year but my most recent refill said I had to pay $50/month for the same drug. The pharmacist gave me no reason and the health plan gave me no warning. All insurance products carry what is termed ‘deductibles’ which is the amount of money patients must pay before the insurance actually pays. The tiers of the ACA have decreasing deductibles with increasing cost of overall insurance. Patients still roll the dice when they are ‘covered’. A recent study reported that two thirds of Americans could not cover a $500 emergency and health insurance deductibles are ‘limited’ to $6850 under the least expensive plan in the ACA market! Such reliably conservative sources as the Wall Street Journal and Forbes have written about how the cost of health care for the average family is rising, even as more people gain insurance, and this cost is creating delays in getting care or receiving appropriate preventive screening. Bankruptcy from lack of insurance is being replaced by bankruptcy from deductibles. What is going on??!!
Underlying all this is the peculiar US cultural belief that if you get something for nothing, you will both over use the service and not value it. When, in the 1980s,
Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) made it possible for visits for preventive care and chronic illness to be free, the use of services saw an 18 month uptick but then settled into a predictable pattern of use. Nevertheless, the country has been furiously backpedaling away from the idea of free-at-the-point-of-service care, adding co-pays and other costs to patients to try to steer them away from, for example, emergency rooms or certain medications. It reminds one of the airline industry where what appear to be inexpensive trips suddenly become expensive because of add ons like paying for bags, paying for a seat with leg room, or paying to get on early, all of which add billions of dollars of revenue that was not planned by travelers.
So there continues to be a dance that insurance companies, employers, state and federal government and citizens engage in that keeps health insurance from being simple to understand and that gives energy to the call for ‘single payer’ without having to deal with the insurance companies and their deductibles. The problem with that approach, sadly, is that the largest single component of the US Gross Domestic Product is unlikely to go through a radical change without resistance from those who stand to lose – including doctors, hospitals, Pharma and insurance companies. And if the NHS, with a long history of being widely accepted as the way to do medical care right, continues to struggle with history, economics and a changing world, one can imagine what lies ahead for the Affordable Care Act, which the Republican congress wants to undermine rather than fix.
A colleague, Paul Gordon MD MPH, a Professor of Family Medicine at the University of Arizona, is on sabbatical bicycling across the United States listening in small communities to people’s opinions and thoughts about Obamacare and writing and recording these stories. It is literally a ground level view of what is happening. (You can read Paul’s stories on his blog: https://bikelisteningtour.wordpress.com/ ) He reports the ambivalence and lack of clarity about the ACA that shows how far the country has to go to get it right. However, the percentage of people who see the ACA as positive is climbing and the percentage of those who are negative is dropping and the lines are likely to cross with the next presidency. But that may not happen if the forces of deception, greed and world class dissembling continue to dominate US politics. Paul Starr’s opening line from his landmark book on the history of American medicine, “the dream of reason did not take power into account” summarizes what lies ahead whatever happens in the US elections.[4] Perhaps a corollary to Starr’s comment is that the dream of reason did not take mindless demagoguery into account, either.

The Bravest Decision
Posted by BJGP Life | 6 Dec 2017 | Undergraduate | 0
Chloe Webster is a 4th year medical student, a yogaholic, creative writing enthusiast, and an aspiring future GP.
I was just absentmindedly skimming through some patient notes, pushing paperwork for a research study, and there it was. In black and white – an advanced directive. My mind just stopped. I re-read the words as if my eyes were playing tricks on me, but the words still remained. An often unspoken part of the world of medicine. The end of life. I was shocked, to say the least, to see this documented in the notes of a young and well patient. The cogs of my mind started turning. Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. Is a DNACPR the bravest decision that we can make? To truly take life in to our own hands, and make the ultimate choice between life and death
The discussion of DNACPR is never easy. Having a close relative arrest in her thirties, and then be resuscitated, has changed my thought process. Are we playing God? Are we bringing people back to life? My mother and I have undoubtedly had this discussion. With a close family member affected, and my role as a CPR trainer, it’s something which we have freely talked about over the years. Today got me thinking. Often, we associate DNACPR with those who are terminally ill, the old, the frail, the weak hospital patients. We never think about those who are young, or well in themselves.
But she’s my mum. The time may come when she is close to death, and I would never want her to suffer anymore.
Although not 100% fit and well having had two rounds of life-changing surgery, my relatively young mother in her forties has already decided her answer to the ‘Big Question’. She wouldn’t want to be ‘brought back’ as it were. As a medic, and loving daughter, it pains me to think that she would die, and that would be it. But she’s my mum. The time may come when she is close to death, and I would never want her to suffer anymore.
It pains me further to think of someone beating down on her chest, potentially breaking ribs in the attempt to put life back in to her suffering body. DNACPR should not be seen as an easy way out, nor giving up on life. Although so well designed, the human body isn’t perfect. Things can go wrong; our health can take over. Sometimes all that is needed is the courage to say no to suffering through living, and accept death.
I think my mum, like so many others, like the patient today, have made the bravest decision of them all.

Carrie Ladd is a part time NHS GP, a spare time RCGP Clinical Fellow in Perinatal Mental Health and a full time mum… doing overtime! You can find her on Twitter @LaddCar and she has a website.
On Sunday 28th November, Dr Lucy Pocock and I co-hosted a session of the Twitter based journal club #gpjc to discuss one of the emerging priority areas of General Practice – Child and Young People’s Mental Health. The BJGP paper we discussed was a systematic review of primary care practitioner’s perceptions to barriers in managing these problems. All contributors seemed to agree that GPs are seeing more and more cases of mental health problems in adolescents but there was some debate as to whether this piece taught us anything new about the challenges we face in supporting these young people.
The themes identified in this review as ‘barriers’ were familiar to those joining the discussion and they are in common with most other mental health sub-specialities. Fear of judgement or stigma may limit disclosure, concerns over confidentiality may limit discussion and lack of referral options locally may restrict what help is available. This review also highlighted a lack of confidence in GPs themselves recognising childhood mental health problems and this may prove a springboard piece of work to address this unmet need in the near future.
This was a large systematic review covering 4151 articles in initial stages with 43 being looked at in detail – 30 quantitative and 13 qualitative. The articles were from a range of countries and one of the points in our discussion questioned whether this undermined or strengthened the validity of the results. Although Australia and Ireland could be seen to have similar health systems/ socioeconomic factors to the UK, perhaps South Africa and Puerto Rico less so? Also many of these studies were not specifically GPs but paediatrics as well which is important to be aware of.
In the final section of the discussion, we looked at how we can mitigate these barriers and collaboration seemed a key theme. Several people suggested better lines of communication with our mental health colleagues. Quarterly MDTs between psychiatry/CMHT & the GP practice, Psychiatry colleagues spending a day a week in General Practice is being done in one innovative GP surgery. In another great example of collaborative working, a specialist eating disorder therapist is based in a predominantly University Population Bristol based GP practice.
Finally, close of discussion included signposting to the RCGP Mental Health Toolkit which is available free, open access to all and mention of Young Minds and MindEd resources which are well worth a look up if new to you. The conversation continued after the scheduled hour and the 10 minute consultation model was cast aside as not fit for purpose when a patient comes to talk about mental health problems with longer appointments welcomed by the #gpjc group.
It is clear that from the GPs who joined the discussions on Sunday, this is an area of general practice we could do better, and we need to galvanise interest and support for a society wide movement to raise awareness and prompt further investment in Child and Young People’s Mental Health services.
If you haven’t popped over on a Sunday evening, check out @GPjournalclub for their monthly discussion group – see you there.

Somewhere over the rainbow
Posted by Peter Aird | 29 Oct 2019 | Opinion | 0
Peter Aird is a GP in Bridgwater, Somerset.
Judy Garland’s was not a happy life.
Last weekend I went to see Renée Zellweger in ‘Judy’. It’s a remarkable performance in a film that portrays Judy Garland towards the end of her tragically short life whilst visiting England in 1969. It reveals the effect on her of having been driven to succeed for the benefit of others, compelled to be what she may not have chosen for herself, and controlled by others to the extent of even of being told when she could and could not eat and sleep.
The mental breakdown that followed was surely inevitable. At one point she was asked had she ever taken anything for her “depression”. She replies “Four husbands –
it didn’t work”. It’s not all she took – alcohol and a combination of the uppers and downers she was first plied with as a child fared no better in relieving her unhappiness. The only time she did seem to be happy was, paradoxically perhaps, when she was where her success had taken her, on stage, in front of the audiences that loved her.
But such happiness was only ever short lived. After the success of her opening night’s performance at London’s ‘The Talk of the Town’, Rosalyn Wilder, her personal assistant on her visit to England, congratulated her and tried to reassure her that she was going to be alright. Garland replied, “But what if I can’t do it again?” In a life where she had been shown little love, she needed the love of her audience but knew that this was always dependent on her constantly delivering what those who came to see her wanted. She was right to be anxious. One night, arriving on stage late and the worse for too much alcohol, the crowd turned hostile and pelted her with bread rolls. Their love was not the unconditional love she needed.
The unconditional love we all need.
There were those who seemed to truly care about her. A couple of ordinary folk seem perhaps an unlikely pair for an international star to be drawn too, but her fondness for them becomes wholly understandable when their genuine affection for her allows her to be her true self. Interestingly, it is when she breaks down in public, revealing that true self on stage, exposing how she really feels, that real compassion flows to her from her audience. Only then, as the star becomes an individual, does the barrier between her and her audience come down.
Boarding the conveyer belt of medical training at an impressionable age, we have been controlled by the system much of our lives.
I’m not sure that Judy Garland really knew how she ended up where she did, or that where she ended up was where she ever really wanted to be. So manipulated was she by the world she found herself in as a child that, once she had entered it, she ceased to be who she really was. Some of us may feel similarly. Boarding the conveyer belt of medical training at an impressionable age, we have been controlled by the system much of our lives, even to the extent of being dictated to by the demands of the job as to when we can eat and sleep. Whilst many have survived this ordeal, and have found satisfaction and happiness in medicine, too many have not but and are left struggling on to their detriment.
How, I wonder, do we cope with not being the person others demand that we are?
More importantly perhaps, how do we cope with not being the person we demand that we are ourselves? Not being able to be the person we long to be, how many of us find ourselves asking, with Judy Garland, “Why, O why can’t I?”.
The answer may reveal why we respond the way we do to complaints, however trivial. Might our self esteem be so easily shattered because that self esteem is already so fragile, too dependent after a lifetime of pleasing others, on having to please everyone? Likewise, might not the anxiety we feel as our appraisal approaches result from our being driven to perform at ever greater levels? The need for us each year to show improvement comes with the inherent implication that last year we were still not good enough. We must, we are told, do better.
And so we strive all the more to satisfy those who demand from us, drive ourselves on in the vain hope that if we could only be the better people we ought to be, all would be well.
Over the summer, in an attempt to concentrate on all things cricket as the Ashes series drew to a close and Somerset CCC still had hopes of the county championship, I watched ‘The Edge’, the film that chronicles England’s climb to the top of the world Test rankings. What became apparent was both how hollow the team’s success felt when it was eventually achieved and how costly, in terms of the adverse effect on the mental health of a number of players, that success was when winning became mandatory.
We live in a world which encourages us to follow our heart and promises that our dreams will come true if only we want them to enough. This is a dangerous philosophy to follow since it simply is not the case. We need to wake up to the fact that our dreams will not necessarily come true and that, as for Judy Garland and a number of the England cricket team, too often they turn into a nightmare.
And when all that fails, it leaves too many of us crying and, what’s more, crying alone.
The emotional well-being of medical professionals is no more important that that of patients, but neither is it any less. And just as patients will not be helped by being burdened with the unrealistic goal of being responsible for their dreams coming true, neither will those in health care be helped by increasing demands being put upon them to be perfect. An insistence that we should merely increase our resilience to cope with what is unreasonably asked of us is tantamount to being told to ‘come on and just get happy’. The justification for this, that ‘when we’re smiling, the whole world smiles with us’ may well be true, but thinking like this results in too many of us putting up with a situation we long to escape, imprisoned by our desire to be seen to succeed and be needed, all the while medicating ourselves to get ourselves through the day. And when all that fails, it leaves too many of us crying and, what’s more, crying alone.
None of us are unaffected by our past. Many of our patients come to us struggling as a consequence of hugely adverse circumstances in their childhood and subsequent lives. Some do not understand how they come to be in the situation that they find themselves to be in and need help to escape. Some of us in medicine are no different. We too need to be able to drop the facade of our professional image and be honest about who we are so that we too can receive the same compassion and understanding as our patients.
We all need a little grace. Grace that does not demand that we be what we are not but frees us to become what we truly really are.
But does such a world exist? Is that place just like that elusive pot of gold we merely can dream about, only found somewhere over the rainbow? Let’s hope not.

Video consultations: a guide for practice
Posted by BJGP Life | 18 Mar 2020 | Coronavirus
Many practices are now using or considering using alternatives to face-to-face consultations because of concerns about Covid-19. Important new information and guidance is now available to support video consultations. Produced by researchers at the University of Oxford, the document covers five key topics. When are video consultations appropriate, how can a practice get ready for them, how can clinicians conduct high-quality video consultations, what can patients do to prepare for and take part in them, and what is the research evidence for their quality and safety?

My first year as a GP physician associate
Posted by BJGP Life | 26 Feb 2020 | Opinion
When I first qualified as a physician associate (PA), I had no intention to work in general practice, at least until later in my career. I was unsure of the impact a PA could have in a GP setting prior to the much anticipated statutory regulation and associated prescribing rights. Having a physician associate within the practice has meant greater accessibility to appointments, less pressure on the on-call doctor, and improved prescribing rates in certain areas.

A BJGP Christmas Carol: Part Three
Posted by BJGP Life | 19 Dec 2018 | Stories | 0
Peter Aird is a GP in Bridgwater, Somerset.
This is part three of a five part series. If you can’t wait and like to binge read then you can download the full five part version for free as an epub or mobi file for use with your Kindle or other e-reader.
Stave Three – in which our tale takes a darker turn
In the few minutes he had to think before the next ghostly visitor was due to arrive, Scrooge reflected on the events of the evening so far and wondered if he should try to claim a few hours of CPD. However, anxious as to how his appraiser might respond to such revelations and fearful that his reflections may be used against him, he concluded, as many before him, that it would be best not to put his thoughts down in writing.
He then realised that it was almost half past two. Was he not to be visited again tonight after all? But within a moment, he was woken from his reverie by the sound of his bedroom door bursting open and the arrival of a rather flustered looking figure entering the room. She was carrying a pile of papers in one hand whilst tapping into the mobile phone she held with the other.
‘I’m sorry to keep you waiting,’ the spectre began. ‘I’ve been so busy tonight and the last chap I visited had several issues that he wanted me to provide spiritual insight on. Blow me if he didn’t have a list! Now what seems to be the problem? I am the Ghost of General Practice Present. Did you have any ideas, concerns or expectations as to how I might haunt you?’
Scrooge looked back at the apparition somewhat non-plussed. He hadn’t asked for the visit and, other than his previous encounters that night, had no experience of consulting with individuals from beyond the grave. Though highly concerned by the present turn of events and expecting to find the whole thing highly disagreeable, he had very little idea as to quite how the encounter should progress. Consequently, Scrooge said nothing.
‘Oh dear,’ said the ghost, unnerved by Scrooge’s silence, ‘This is awkward. I told Marley that there was little point in my visiting you without you being willing to see me. You see it’s so hard to help somebody unless they realise they have a problem and want to be helped.’
Still Scrooge found himself lost for words.
Rather than using the silence as a technique for therapeutic communication, the ghost laid the papers that she had been carrying down upon Scrooge’s bed and started flipping through the pages. ‘I’m sure there is a guideline for this situation somewhere. Give me a minute and I’ll be with you as soon as I find it. I don’t want to get this wrong.’ A few minutes passed, at the end of which the ghost seemed to have found what it was that she was looking for. ‘Ah yes, that’s it – come with me. I’m to show you how Christmas is being spent by others this year. Only I’m running short of time so we’ll have to make it quick.’
Once again, Scrooge was taken by the hand but, somewhat to his disappointment, she led him down the stairs in the conventional fashion before continuing through the front door and out into the night. ‘I’m afraid that these days we don’t employ the use of magic flight,’ the spirit explained, ‘There’s no evidence for it, you see. It’s all evidence-based hauntings these days.’
The fog had thickened making it difficult to see where they were going but the ghost still had hold of her phone and had entered the postcode of their destination into Google maps. Before long they reached a block of flats and proceeded to climb the communal stairs. On the second floor, they passed through the wall into the home of a young family, the spirit assuring Scrooge as they did so, that the Celestial Institute for Ethereal Excellence had approved, in highly selected cases, what was known in the profession as quantum tunnelling, provided said cases met stringent eligibility criteria.
The flat bore witness to the fact that it was Christmas Day. The mantelpiece and sideboard were covered with Christmas cards and coloured paper chains were hanging from the ceiling. In the corner was a Christmas tree under which a three year old boy was happily making good use of the colouring set he had recently unwrapped. He stood up and walked into the kitchen where his parents were preparing dinner. They turned to him and noticed that he was covered in red spots. Immediately his mother emptied the pint glass of Prosecco she was drinking and used it to perform the ‘tumbler test’, her anxiety being heightened all the more when the rash failed to disappear. She pressed the speed dial button on her phone and called ‘111’.
‘I’m worried about my son – he’s covered in spots,’ she exclaimed to the call handler. ‘No – he seems well in himself… No, no vomiting or fever… No, no headache or tummy pain… No, no catastrophic loss of blood… and no – he has just the one head.’ The list of negatives continued until the questioner focused in on the rash. ‘Well, it’s almost as if he’s been marking himself with a red felt tip pen!’ The women listened to the call handler for a few moments longer before ending the call.
‘What did they say?’ her partner asked.
‘Something about a non-blanching rash being possible meningitis and that it’s better to be safe than sorry. They’re sending an ambulance.’
‘Bloomin’ right too. Now let me refill your glass, we can’t have you sober when it arrives!’
The Ghost of Christmas Present indicated to Scrooge that it was time to move on. Their next stop was just across the stairwell. Passing once more through the walls of the property, Scrooge recognised Mrs Gray, the frail elderly lady who lived there, as one of his patients. She was nearing the end of her life due to her having advanced metastatic disease. A single Christmas card lay face down on the dining room table, alongside of which was a box of chocolates she had bought for herself in an attempt to make Christmas Day, the fifth she’d have spent alone since the death of her husband, at least a little special. She knew it would probably be her last. As Scrooge looked on, the woman picked up the chocolates and shuffled slowly across the room and then, for want of anyone else to give them to, placed them in the kitchen bin.
‘What’s she doing?’ Scrooge asked the spirit.
‘She doesn’t think you’d approve if she ate them’ replied the ghost, who then proceeded to point to a letter held to the fridge door by a magnet commemorating the Queen’s Silver Jubilee. It was from Scrooge’s medical practice informing her that her recent routine blood tests had revealed that she had a slightly elevated HbA1c and that she was therefore classified as ‘pre diabetic’. Included with the letter was a leaflet giving helpful advice on healthy eating.
Scrooge stood staring at the woman. He realised that, though if asked to relay the ins and outs of all her most recent blood tests he would have been up to the task, in recent years at least, he’d not really known her at all.
The spirit had left the flat and Scrooge hurried to catch her up. They walked together without talking until they came to a house that Scrooge had never visited before. Here they stopped and stood outside the window of a dimly lit room. Peering in through the poorly drawn curtains they could see the figure of Bob Cratchit. He was sat, his head in his hands, surrounded by various medical textbooks. To his left was a half empty bottle of scotch and a packet of antidepressants. He was writing a note.
Scrooge turned to the Ghost of General Practice. ‘What’s he doing?’ he asked.
‘Struggling’ she replied.
‘But why? He’s such a good doctor.’
‘He is indeed. But he doesn’t know it. He has come to believe that he has to be perfect – that every guideline must be followed and a failure to do so will result in legal action being taken against him. He’s taken on the burden that comes from believing that medicine has the answer to every problem experienced by a broken society. He thinks it’s all down to him. He has been worn down by the constant demand from both society and the profession that he must perform better – that good enough is not good enough. He’s exhausted by the never ending assessment of his performance and crushed by the weight of the responsibility he feels. He lives in the constant fear that it’ll all be his fault if anything bad ever happens. He too feels all alone this Christmas.’
‘But this afternoon? He asked to leave early to spend some time with his family.’
‘Indeed he did but the truth is that he hasn’t much in the way of a family – just a couple of friends he thinks of as family. In reality he had hoped to meet those friends for a drink but things didn’t quite work out the way they were planned. When he left the surgery late yesterday he went back to check on one of the patients he’d visited. Their condition had deteriorated and he arranged an admission but he was left feeling guilty and anxious. As a result he didn’t think he’d make very good company. And besides, he was worried about his CSA exam and thought the time would be better spent preparing for that.’
‘But he’ll pass the exam easily,’ Scrooge exclaimed. ‘He’s come on leaps and bounds since that unfortunate misunderstanding the first time round. The patients love him – and the staff. He’ll make a great GP.’
‘Have you ever told him that?’
Scrooge fell silent. Perhaps he could have been a bit more supportive, encouraged a little more. Perhaps he could have helped him steer a course through the mass of expectation and enabled him to distinguish between what was genuinely important and what could appropriately be ignored. Perhaps he could have been the kind of trainer Fezziwig had been to him – one who, despite the changes enforced on the profession, could still see the joy of working in general practice and convey a little of that to the next generation – one who would fight for what was worth fighting for rather than retreating into cynicism, bitterness, and resentment.
‘I never knew he felt so alone. I never knew he was finding it so hard.’
‘Did you ever ask?’
Scrooge’s head fell. ‘Can I speak to him now?’
‘I’m afraid not. He won’t be able hear you, and what’s more our time is up. We must go.’
‘But I must do something.’
‘That’s as maybe – but you have another appointment to keep. You must meet the Ghost of General Practice Yet To Come.’
The ghost started back towards Scrooge’s home. Scrooge himself lingered a little longer at the window in the hope that Cratchit would see him and appreciate his concern. Finally he turned his back on the scene and trudged slowly after the ghost who was now some yards ahead of him. Behind him, Cratchit slipped silently into the deepest of deep sleeps.
The spirit accompanied Scrooge back to his room but, before she left, she had one small request.
‘I’d be most grateful if you could fill in this form by way of giving feedback on my performance this evening. And it would be very helpful if you could indicate whether you’d feel able to recommend me to your friends and family… ‘
Regretting the choice of words even as she spoke them, an awkward silence arose between them. The spirit looked at Scrooge and Scrooge looked back
‘… or perhaps just an acquaintance… a passer-by even?’
Sensing that now was clearly not the time, the Spirit said a hurried goodbye and left, leaving Scrooge alone with his thoughts. He couldn’t stop thinking about what he’d seen. He tried to convince himself it was all a dream, that none of it was real. Had things really become this bad? And could the future be worse? He had a feeling he was about to find out.

BJGP Long Read: A valedictory note on my retirement
Posted by BJGP Life | 21 Feb 2020 | BJGP Long Read | 18
Claire Stillman is a recently retired GP who spent 30 years in Scottish general practice, the last 20 of which were in Glasgow.
About eight months ago I wrote an emotional, angry rant about why I was leaving general practice. It was in response to a questionnaire from the LMC asking me for reasons why I was going. I never sent it to them; it seemed enough to write everything down and it exhausted my anger. I kept meaning to go back to it but I never did, probably because it was too upsetting when I was in work and then it became irrelevant when I left. My emotion had been expended. Also, I felt that I had said nothing new. There were no blinding insights, other people had said the same things over and over and nothing had changed. It is hard to see how anything can change given the current structure and funding of the NHS. I should say that I took early retirement at the age of 59 following 30 years in General Practice and I might have taken a handful of days of sick leave in that time. I never took any time off for stress.
Here are the reasons I left, or perhaps some of them:
Appointments
The appointment system is not fit for purpose. A GP has to be all things to all people in 10 minutes only and this is untenable. In this time we have to deal with the polypharmacised multiply morbid patient who has several problems to discuss. We have to manage an increasing amount of clinical work transferred from secondary to primary care. We have to deal with the manipulative, the dangerous and the deluded. We have to deal with those with shopping lists of demands, the worried well, those sent by third parties for proof of just about anything. We have to deal with the longwinded, the demented, the unhappy, the angry. We have to deal with the worried parent and the sick child. We have to deal with the medical emergency or those who think it is an emergency. The list goes on. We are accessible to everyone, every single being has the right to walk in to discuss anything; there is no filter, no prior discussion to see whether a trip to a GP is appropriate or suitable.
We pay an emotional price for constant availability for everything the world throws at us.
GPs can be bullied and manipulated by a public who increasingly demand certainty and rights and a bureaucracy that seeks to medicalise social problems. In all this we have no support. We were trained to help others’ suffering, not manage our own. We pay an emotional price for constant availability for everything the world throws at us (and I mean everything), and a professionalism that is never acknowledged or meaningfully supported. We face the relentless expectations of the ten minute appointment, the constantly full waiting rooms, the unacceptable waiting times to be seen and feel constantly punished because we cannot meet them. I can honestly say that in all my time as a GP principle, I can count on one hand the times I did not have a fully booked surgery. Government policy, patient expectation, pressure on our staff mean that we are constantly in the wrong, on the back foot, for not delivering a service that, quite frankly, is impossible to provide. We are supposed to be made of teflon, have no feelings, cope with the relentless daily, monthly, yearly pressure of not delivering the impossibly perfect service that this society believes is their right.
Patient expectations
Expectations by patients have changed over my thirty years in practice. Society has changed; the consumer approach, the belief that everything should have an answer, the inability to accept the uncertainty of life and health; the belief that if something goes wrong someone must be to blame have all increased over time. Expectations increasingly fuelled by the unrealistic claims made on the internet. Also the idea that everyone should have instant access, instant answers, has grown. These expectations are not really compatible with what GPs do, namely manage uncertainty. Because of this GPs have been harried into increasing amounts of patient tests, often with no clear goal in mind and no evidence that it would be useful. On the contrary, tests breed insecurity and more tests, because doctors feel the need to cover themselves, to insure themselves against patients demanding ever more certainty. It is ironic that in an age when the population has never been more healthy or long lived, health uncertainty and anxiety increases. Adding to patient expectations is the medicalisation of human sadness. The belief that a doctor can make grief, sadness, the ordinary difficulties of life better with a pill or therapy seems to have increased steadily over the years.
Lack of resources
Mental health services were reason enough to leave general practice.
GPs are damned if they do and damned if they don’t. We are placed in impossible double binds by chronic NHS underfunding and then blamed for the outcomes. Classic examples are the exploitation of our gate keeping roles by saying we must refer less into secondary care and then blaming us for not diagnosing enough cancers. We are held responsible for not diagnosing the rarest of cancers, which have no characteristic sets of symptoms, and yet demonised or refused by secondary care if we refer patients like these in.
Mental health services were reason enough to leave general practice. The NHS in my area refused to fund or possibly organise an even half functioning service and given society’s propensity for medicalising any adverse human experience we were imprisoned in the ultimate double bind and for us it was a life sentence. Throughout my entire career I was supposed to deal with the mentally distressed in ten minute appointments with no credible back up. The media slammed us for handing out too many antidepressants giving the impression that we had any alternatives. Trust me, we did not. The stark choices for GPs dealing with mental distress ranging from overt psychosis to a little sadness were a prescription for a pill then and there and a bit more than ten minutes (thereby pressurising everyone else in the waiting room), or a referral for a mental health treatment, be it talking therapy or more assessment which might occur within the next 3 to 6 months. The icing on the cake was that despite a GP referral, the mental health service might decide, several weeks later, not to offer any treatment at all. Truly GPs backs are up against the wall when dealing with mental health problems, which on a conservative estimate, take up to 20% of their work. Indeed, there is a psychological component to all disease. Dealing with mental health services throughout my career was the most excruciating and depressing aspect of my job.
Another problem caused by underfunding, which inexorably worsened throughout my time in practice, was waiting times. This has caused the NHS to become cruel in its dealing with suffering patients. I have seen people with severe, debilitating, painful conditions having to wait up to a year to be seen in secondary care. And then they get sent for tests, have to wait months for their results, and then they have to wait further months for follow up in clinics to get the results of said tests. Hospital doctors never make decisions without panels of tests that seem to grow larger by the year. Meanwhile the GP is the only doctor a patient can directly access while waiting for all these events, the walls are very high around secondary care, and we are expected to manage their pain, anxiety and frustration with no power to change anything. As usual, there is no support for the GP managing the patient in this vacuum and the more compassionate the GP, the more likely they are to be broken by this powerlessness in the face of suffering.
Complexity
Patients are becoming increasingly complex. They live longer, are on more medication and often have two, three or even more co-existing conditions. We are expected to deal with their needs in ten minutes, or consider their problems in the little time we have between fire-fighting paperwork and results and managing the practice. Meanwhile secondary care is becoming more specialised with increasing numbers of silos. A patient goes to a hospital clinic where a specialist has the luxury of dealing with one condition only, with all the back up of a hospital department. And it can happen that the decision a specialist makes about the one condition that is their remit will have a knock on effect for the other conditions a patient might have. It is left to the GP to sort it out. A record achieved by one of my patients was that he visited seven different specialties on a regular basis, all of which dealt with one aspect of his care and none of which could come up with an overarching explanation for his symptoms. Needless to say I had ten minutes to deal with all of them. The use of protocols, guidelines and non-doctor vetting of secondary care referrals also lead to GP stress, not to say cruelty to the patient. The silos are getting narrower, secondary care clinicians are more and more empowered to say what they will not deal with . Meanwhile GPs have to deal with their rejections with no support for their suffering patients.
Polypharmacy
This is a real problem in the ten minute appointment. All evidence based medicine derives from studies on single conditions and all medication guidelines come from them. The problem is that very few patients have only one condition. The GP has to juggle co-prescribed medications with their multiplicity of interactions and side effects in each individual, very difficult in a busy surgery with a waiting room full of patients expecting to be seen on time. Ironically when the community pharmacists started to be involved in the Scottish NHS new contract, they stated they would need thirty minutes per patient. And a pharmacist would only be dealing with medications while the GP has to deal with the actual patient’s agenda, which may be something else entirely. Prescribing outwith the consultation has also become more onerous over the last few years as drug shortages and the increasing prescribing demands of secondary care have to be managed.
Poorly understood conditions/somatisation/chronic pain
Some of the hardest patients to deal with, the most time consuming and emotionally draining, are the ones that don’t fit into neat diagnostic boxes, yet constantly present with suffering and demand answers. These patients are not recognised by, and certainly not treated by secondary care. For example, those people with chronic pain for which we actually have no effective medication. Synthetic opiates, the only treatment out there, do not work and turn them into addicts. Any attempts at psychological reframing of their conditions are seriously resisted by the patients, and to be frank, the medical establishment.
There seems to be a belief that GP is elastic can continuously absorb extra work indefinitely.
The Cartesian dualism that bedevils our concepts of illness means that patients and many doctors think that the ultimate insult is to suggest that their suffering is ‘all in their head’ and for some strange reason does not then exist. Unfortunately GPs are faced with a number of patients who manifest their life distress with physical symptoms, call it somatisation for want of a better term, for whom existing medicine has no treatment and who become bitterly entrenched in their illness behaviour as they feel less and less cared for. The ‘fibromyalgics’, the chronically fatigued, for whom there is no realistic therapy and for which GPs have no training or support. I am not surprised that so many of them turn to snake oil salesman and quacks who at least provide them with attention before exploiting their vulnerabilities.
Outsourcing of secondary care work
Over the years, general practice has been subjected to a form of ‘mission creep’ with secondary care demanding that we increasingly do work that was originally done in hospital medicine. While it may seem reasonable that GPs manage new atrial fibrillation or perform near patient testing, this is added to our already increasing workload. There seems to be a belief that GP is elastic can continuously absorb extra work indefinitely. There is only so much work that we can take before we break.
Housebound patients
While home visit rates have gone down, housebound patients are becoming increasingly complex so that visits can resemble ward rounds in a geriatric hospital. Patients are often on medications and have conditions that need frequent monitoring and repeat visits that we are not resourced to manage. Latterly, I became increasingly concerned about our cohort of usually elderly, frail housebound patients on complex, potentially dangerous treatment regimes who were poorly managed in the community. General practice as it stands is just not equipped to deal with these people.
Conclusion
I think the chief thing to emphasise is that GPs stand alone, and are chronically under resourced. We may work in group practices and have our administration staff, but once the door is closed, it is just the GP and the patient in the room together. And in real time we have no support, indeed we have no formal support networks at all on the ground. There is no-one to catch us as we fall, we have no protection from the ire of the public, anger that is usually caused by a system that fails to deliver what has been promised. We stand and fall by the decisions we make in ten minutes and if things go wrong, the full weight of public and professional opprobrium lands on our heads. There is no safety net, no cavalry coming over the hill to relieve us.
Now, I have retired and I do not miss any of it. I was well thought of by my patients and staff to judge by the feedback I have received over the years and the overwhelming number of cards and presents I received when I retired. I also got on with and liked my partners. Yet a powerful emotion I associate with my time in general practice was one of failure. I had failed to deliver a good service and so now I am just relieved to be free of it. However, what does bother me is that I had a wealth of knowledge and skills, accumulated over lifetime, which I will never use again.
Yet there is no place for me now in my profession, general practice has lost my skills and those of all my retired peers completely.
And what does strike me is that perhaps my profession could benefit from my and my peers’ experience. I could perhaps mentor younger GPs, newly practising partners, and provide them with the support I never had. I can read a face, interpret its subtle movements, be aware of another’s suffering. I can listen actively and frame peoples’ stories empathetically and positively. I can pull out the essential points in a narrative, summarise a conversation, help someone form a plan for the future. I can listen. Yet there is no place for me now in my profession, general practice has lost my skills and those of all my retired peers completely. I feel that this is a shame as we are a resource that could be utilised for the good of the profession.
As for the future of general practice, I do not trust the Scottish NHS and the health boards to deliver the supposed new Scottish GP contract. They mouth platitudes but follow their own agendas rather than those of general practice, they have not trusted GPs to execute the changes and allocated funds seem to have dissipated in a plethora of talking shops and committees. It seems that the further you remove practitioners, the people who actually do the work, from decisions about how the work is done, the less successful the outcome. Unfortunately, GPs have been so busy actually doing their jobs, they have not had the time or emotional energy to fight for a new contract that works for them. I have little hope that the new contract will result in better experiences for patients or their doctors.
However, it can be argued that innovation, out of the box thinking comes from those without an interest in the system, so let’s throw the problem of how to run an NHS out there. Let all and sundry chew on it, because I don’t expect those within the system to come up with any answers. Lets hope someone has thought of something before the inevitable happens to me and I become a patient.

Thank you so very much for putting my sentiments down in such an eloquent way. I left my partnership in Glasgow recently aged 55 for the reasons you have outilined. I waited for the new contract and knew it was inadequate and resigned my partnership.
“the more compassionate the GP, the more likely they are to be broken by this powerlessness in the face of suffering”- this especially very much summed up my experience.
I now locum and feel more protected and distanced from the toxic work conditions expected of me by myself, patients, the NHS and the SG. I feel my experience of 30years as a doctor is wasted and I just have to suck it up and not dwell on it. That’s life! A shame when there is so much capacity of compassion and skill to give to people, given the right conditions.

Hi, given the current situation, perhaps we should view Active GP as something that you do for a finite time only, as part of a “portfolio career “ not a whole working lifetime. Rather you spend sometime at the frontline, then move onto less stressful jobs having done your bit. The question would be what to move on to that we have the skills and training for, apart from locum work. Also I think most people would agree that the more experienced the doctor the better practitioner they are. Always remembering that experience can just mean making the same mistakes with increasing confidence!

I also took early retirement from GP Partnership at 56 and have not regretted it. As I walked out of my surgery for the last time I almost literally felt a weight lifted from my shoulders. I share the author’s regret that I can’t continue to use the wisdom and experience gained over 30 years to help patients and relieve some of the burden from my younger colleagues.

Wow. Thank you for a brilliant, honest piece. I’m relatively early in my GP career and I recognise ALL of what you say. At the moment, the good outweighs the bad for me in GP, but I do wonder if I have the resilience to stay the distance. The lesson for me is: look after yourself and each other, because everyone else will milk you as dry as you let them.
I have saved this article for future reference and sharing. Thank you again.

I also took early retirement at 59 now nearly 7 years ago. This article describes my feelings too (OK in England not Scotland). I feel too that stopping work lifted a burden from me and regret at never being able to do the job to the best of my ability due to constant time pressure. The skills I gained in listening to my patients for over 30 years are no longer available to the NHS, as new less experienced doctors are assumed to be of equal value to the NHS. Bums on seats can be counted and that’s what appears to matter to those counting and making the rules.

Thanks for all your comments. Perhaps the RCGP should consider the mentoring idea! I refer to the comment I made above about limited stints at the front line. Sadly, in Scotland there is a shortage of new GPS and practices have had to shut up shop because of this. Clare

Clair, your comments eloquently outline the challenges and unreasonable demands placed on GP’s and 5 years ago I faced the same dilemma in my English practice of 30 years, and at 58 I too decided it was time to leave. I then decided to tackle a different challenge and moved to a much smaller remote and rural practice in the Hebrides as an NHS salaried partner. Surgeries and lists became smaller and I now have the luxury of time to spend with the patients and have the support of fabulous community staff. The experience and knowledge I’ve accumulated has been well used and I’ve truly enjoyed this final phase of my medical career, and I’m still working here
5 years later!
We are privileged to have the job we do, but time pressures can certainly prevent us giving our patients the service they deserve.

What a brilliantly written article. Comprehensively details why GP is failing and will likely not exist, at least in its current format, in the next 10-15 years. GP is the Walmart of medicine, pile them in, stack them high – all you can fit, anything and everything in a 10min appt. It is popular with politicians as they need cheap medicine by GPs to subsidise the expensive specialists and keep the tax payers happy with lower tax rates.
Unfortunately the real world is not like the Dr Who Tardis and time does not expand. GPs are human and to remain humane, we need to self care to avoid burnout. For some it will be time to boundary patients, for others it will be time to cut back on sessions and and for many it is time to look for alternative careers. I used to look at GPs as a child in the 1980s with deep respect and awe, they had status and commanded respect from their peers. These times no longer exist. Now each day is a battle for many if not most. I left the NHS year ago and will not return, I wish those of you who remain the best.

This has been one of the best short reads describing what GP life has become and I can’t disagree with any of it. Strange thing is, like the Gp reply above, who moved to a small rural practice , and enjoying his last 5 years, I too have honestly rarely ever had a bad day in my 30 years as a GP partner now aged 58 Wales. Small personalised list 2750 (weighted list 3500) in a 2 person (1.5fte) so 4 day week. The single biggest reason I remain happy and peaceful in the midst of the plethora of issues you so eloquently describe is for me they all become so much milder/manageable/solvable when there is someone who armed with a life time knowledge of their small 1300-1500 patients characters, expectations and illnesses, finds decisions and tests ,mail and the whole lot becomes quicker easier, more thorough.Its not that I am not busy ,it’s just not always busy. It’s not that I am better as I am not.
From what I see and hear in the profession generally, I can’t see a sustainable way forward for Primary care unless we rapidly move to personalised lists, yes in group partnerships supported by HCSW/Nurses/PA/admin . I mean where you are solely responsible for your own patients, not someone else’s,not strangers,not patients who try and manipulate new GPs. Yes seek 2nd opinions occasionally, Expect yes a day off each week where similar partner /colleagues cover any emergencies.No long waits to be seen . Telephone first less necessary, “Rubbish“ I hear some think,but I maintain it is all very possible because my experience is the time saving and in depth supervision by one GP of an almost totally “known” population really does yield the time and space to let us cope,grow and even thrive.
Most complex illnesses become less stressful as you have been with them through it all and know them almost as well as they do. Your previous consultation laid out the actions you would do if they returned. Ten minutes often plenty bar the first new complex illness, no more long history taking by talented GPs who have little knowledge of the patient multiplied a thousand times a year .Less mental stress and clinician anxiety.
Add in HCSW, social Prescribing and decent mental health services and it become a real pleasure and something even at 58 I don’t wish to give up.
Planning 2 days a week till 65.
You asked for a solution. There it is. Not meant to be Patronising. Personalised lists where you and only you ,95% of the time have to make the decisions that will affect your workplace tomorrow and next week Is the way ahead. .Claire, please don’t stay away, seek a small practice as you are incredibly valuable. As for me I am planning 2 days a week till 65.

I am a 50 year old GP working in North West England. I could not agree more with everything that is written in this article. I am a very robust individual and continue to work as a Partner in a large practice with great colleagues. However I have seen many very good people “broken” (alcoholism, Depression, burn out) by the toxic environment of General Practice.Good UK GPs are some of the finest and hard working General Physicians in the world. In the last 10 years I have come to the conclusion that the NHS is not fit for purpose in the current world and never will be. The sooner the NHS becomes a private insurance based service then the sooner GPs will be able to control their workload / quality of care and lead a full rewarding working life that does not “break them”.

A very eloquent summary I agree.
I too share the regret at not being able or knowing how to use the skills I have acquired after 33y in General Practice. I would like to do something to help

Liz – see my reply below.
Perhaps “Rediscover the Joy” might offer you the opportunity.

Clair, what a beautifully written article.
Thank you.
Last year I initiated the project “Rediscover the Joy of General Practice” https://www.srmc.scot.nhs.uk/joy-project/
It is specifically designed for GPs like you coming up for retirement but who feel they have more to give, but not under the pressures you describe.
It began as a collaboration between NHS Orkney, Shetland, Western Isles and Highland and this year has expanded to include other Scottish Health Boards.
It is based on work undertaken in Orkney over the last 10 years.
We offer contracts of between 6-18+ weeks/year to undertake practice attachments for periods of 1-4 weeks at a time. Travel from a Scottish city and accommodation is paid for, meaning that GPs do not need to relocate.
Our philosophy is based on supporting the practices and staff in all aspects of GP work and quality improvement.
Have a look at the website to understand the scheme more fully.
In 2019 we recruited 33 GPs to our Rural GP Support Team, many were retiring GPs who have felt reinvigorated by working with us.
This year we have expanded the scheme to involve the whole of Scotland and not just rural practices.
Currently we have shortlisted a further 35 GPs.
Although we have officially closed, we will still accept late applications and will reopen to applications again once we have established this second team.
What is interesting is that as our team expands and develops we suddenly find that we have the opportunity to consider how we can tackle what previously seemed intractable problems.
All members of the team are encouraged to contribute their ideas of how we could tackle thorny issues and due to the phenomenal depth of experience and expertise among our GPs we find ourselves in an unusually empowered position.
The project is led by the Primary Care Associate Medical Directors and Managers from the participating Health Boards and has the full backing of the Scottish Government.
We are at an early stage and certainly do not have all the answers, but we are determined to try and make a difference.
Working together with vision, determination and lateral thinking I believe we can make real changes – however, I am a self-confessed irresponsible optimist!
Anyone interested, do have a look at the website and please feel free to join us.
Claire, I would very much like to have a chat with you and to explore some of your ideas.
My email is charles.siderfin@nhs.net

When Sparks Fly: Choosing General Practice
Posted by BJGP Life | 18 Feb 2018 | Undergraduate | 1
Chloe Webster is a 4th year medical student, a yogaholic, creative writing enthusiast, and an aspiring future GP.
He was so different from the rest. Often, the only patients I remember clearly in my mind are unfortunately those who make me sad or angry. I am writing this as almost some sort of memoir to my future self so that I don’t forget such a lovely man. A simple 15-minute routine consultation changed more than just the outlook of my day, it changed me. I can still picture his tan brown boat shoes, woolly jumper and wire-rimmed glasses framing his welcoming face. From the moment I called his name, there was something about him. Within a matter of seconds, we had connected.
He had constant pins and needles, and all that he needed was to think of a damaged wire, sparking and sending signals when it shouldn’t.
He had come to see me at the surgery that morning. He shared his story with me and I was trusted to gain such a thorough understanding of his life. He told me everything. He had questions, and I was able to give him the answers he needed to understand his body. He had had neuropathic pain for over 20 years and no one, not even the specialists, had taken the time to explain what was going on. I couldn’t believe that he had been in the dark for such a long period of time. I explained the problem to him with my trusted analogy of rusty, damaged wires. His face lit up as soon as I started talking. He told me that he was an electrical engineer by trade. We laughed among ourselves at the coincidence, but I could see in his eyes that he finally understood what was happening. He had constant pins and needles, and all that he needed was to think of a damaged wire, sparking and sending signals when it shouldn’t. He was so truly thankful, and I was taken aback by his gratitude. A self-acknowledged infrequent attendee who finally had the answers he needed, and all it took was a few minutes of my day.
When he shook my hand before his departure, it felt as if I had known this man for my entire life.
When he shook my hand before his departure, it felt as if I had known this man for my entire life, rather than just the past 15 minutes, as if we had been dear old friends catching up. We both said our sincerest farewells until we meet again. He made such an impact, and I am a better person, maybe even a better doctor-to-be, for our paths crossing.
I sat alone in the consultation room. I paused, just for a moment to reflect upon the contentment spreading through me. I couldn’t hold back the smile spreading across my face. The thought of a career in general practice had briefly entered my mind before, but until now, it was never a decision with much certainty. Now I know – this is how I want to spend my life.
A career with the ability to truly know my patients on a one-to-one basis, a stranger enters the room but an acquaintance leaves, even in those pressured 10-minutes to be able to make a difference no matter how small.
This is why I am choosing general practice.

That was a beautiful piece. Well done for what you did for your patient, you gave him a threshold concept in your explanation of his symptoms that relates to his profession and life skills albeit coincidentally. Your analogy helped him to understand his disease and symptoms in a way that is deeper than any descriptive terminology could achieve, by simply comparing it to something very familiar to him. I have certainly learnt from your well written piece that occupational history can be used for something other than diagnosis and management of a disease. I have no doubt you will make an excellent GP, one that i could trust to be my doctor!

Why do you want to be a GP? The one question we don’t ask
Posted by BJGP Life | 18 May 2018 | AiT, Opinion | 2
Kirsty Wooff is currently working in Emergency Medicine in the Northern Territory (Australia) but she is heading home in August to begin ST1 of GP training in the West of Scotland.
So why do you want this job?
The first question to practise before a job interview; the one we all know will make an appearance…right?
Well, not if you’ve chosen to pursue a career in general practice. Whilst my colleagues were preparing evidence of their accomplishments and practising expected questions, I was revising for the entrance exam and practising OSCE based scenarios. So why is the entry to GP training so different, and what does that mean for the specialty?
Why is the entry to GP training so different, and what does that mean for the specialty?
The application process for GP training consists of two parts. Part 1 encompasses the written exam testing both clinical knowledge and situational based judgement, part 2 is an OSCE style exam with 3 oral stations and a written station which looks at task prioritisation. According to the OSCE guidance they are looking for participants to demonstrate four key qualities: empathy and sensitivity, conceptual thinking and problem solving, communication skills and professional integrity. Four qualities which are key to being a good doctor, let alone a good GP.
I want to be a GP. I think it can be one of the most rewarding fields of medicine. I’m excited to begin training in a career where I can, hopefully, provide both great quality and continuity of care within the community. The relationship you can build with patients is a really appealing aspect to me as is the idea of being a generalist specialist. Knowing a bit of everything and relying on strong clinical acumen are two key components of being a GP that drew me to the speciality.
I want to be a GP. I think it can be one of the most rewarding fields of medicine… I was ready to tell the world this but then no-one asked me.
I was ready to tell the world this but then no-one asked me. I didn’t expect to be asked by my current colleagues (I’m a young female doctor; I mention GP training and I get a knowing nod…) but I did expect to get asked by my future colleagues – surely they would want to make sure I was committed to GP training for the right reasons and that I might actually add something to the profession?
I was fortunate enough to get a place on the training programme I wanted and I was delighted. I also felt, however, a bit disappointed: did it even matter that I’d actively chosen to become a GP and if the application process was so disinterested in me on a personal level, would the training process be the same?
What I’m advocating for here is one simple question. It doesn’t have to be part of the marking criteria but, by asking it, we’d be changing the way applicants felt.
Why do you want to be a GP? So simple yet so crucial. Not only does it infer that we are interested in the applicant on a more personal level, it also infers that as a speciality we care about who becomes a GP. We want people that want to be GPs. We want people that will make good colleagues. We want people to be proud to be a GP. Surely it’s in our favour to find applicants who have actively chosen to become a GP?
It’s a common flaw within the medical world that GPs aren’t given the recognition or respect that they deserve but how can we expect our non-GP colleagues (and members of the public) to respect us if we don’t treat ourselves with respect.
We don’t ‘fall into’ GP training; we actively choose it as a rewarding and fulfilling career and it’s time we begin to recognise that.

Thanks Kirsty for your article – you make an excellent point. Medicine is in danger of losing the human touch as we are increasingly encouraged to be concerned with applying the correct protocol to the data sat in front of us rather than rsponding to the person that data relates to with care and compassion. Sometimes we need to try and do the good thing that is unmeasurable rather than the measurable accurate thing. We make a mistake when we are only interested in what can be measured and it sounds that this mistake has crept into the selection process too. For what it’s worth I for one am glad you’re heading into General Practice and are doing so for all the right reasons. I wish you well – it indeed a most rwarding job and hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

Thank you Peter. I think I just found the whole selection process impersonal and frustrating and on reflection I felt that just the addition of one simple question would change how it had made me feel – a straightforward solution!

Enthusiasm, inspiration and pride at the RCGP Annual Conference
Posted by BJGP Life | 22 Nov 2019 | Opinion | 0
Dr Katie Barnett is a Post CCT Fellow with Haxby Group Practice in York and an Honorary Clinical Fellow in the Department of Health Sciences at the University of York. She is on Twitter @drkatiebarnett1 and blogs about wellbeing and fellowship at: Thefellowshipmonologues.wordpress.com
So why should I go to the RCGP Annual Conference…
I can summarise it in 3 words: Enthusiasm, Inspiration and Pride.
Sometimes in primary care we can get isolated. It can feel like the wheels just keep turning and Proud Mary keeps on burning … the candle at both ends. It is easy to lose the wins amongst the negative chatter. It is easy to lose your patience for your patients while thinking about the tasks piling up. It can feel like a pressure cooker of emotional and intellectual labour, just waiting for a swing and a missed diagnosis. With the media adding fuel to the fire. Mainstream talking about GPs missing signs of cancer, dementia, heart failure, depression and everything else they know nothing about. GP magazines talking about burnout and crises and snowflakes and all the while patients wait three weeks for a routine appointment.
I’ll be honest, I have a bit of an ostrich tendency. Stop reading about it and it can’t impact me, stop talking to my colleagues and I won’t hear about how terrible it is… but then the loneliness and cynicism sets in.
And it certainly got my head out of the sand.
Going to an event like the RCGPAC can bring together people from all walks of life, from the deep end practices of Glasgow, to the leafy suburbs or York, from the rural wilds of North Wales, to the inner city impoverished super practices of Birmingham, from medical students to retired GP’s, from Matt Hancock to Becky Malby. And it certainly got my head out of the sand.
Having an event that celebrates our diversity of thoughts, ideas, people and talent is something I think we should be incredibly proud of. The event celebrates everything good with general practice and allows people to connect and learn from one another in a positive and nurturing environment. I attended workshops about art and wellbeing, greener practice, burnout in the wider team, new models of practice, developing research interests and consulting with vulnerable patients (to name a few). I came away inspired to try these changes in my own practice. At my practice we are now looking at ways we can be more green, ways we can improve long term condition management by utilising the wider workforce and bringing in a wellbeing policy with mentors at each site, including the whole team.
And that is just from the breakout sessions. The plenaries genuinely brought tears to my eyes. Jamie Hynes ‘If’ ​poem​, and Roger Neighbours ‘Humankind Ness’ talk gave me that hard to explain feeling of ‘yes. this. so much this.’ Sir Michael Marmot, chosen by President Mayur Lakhani to provide the John Hunt lecture for this year, spoke with passion about social inequality still being the greatest barrier to good healthcare. He empowered us to take this knowledge to our communities and fight for those with less by trying to close the gap between rich and poor and think about how we can provide healthcare for those who do not seek it but for whom it can have the greatest impact. Prof Becky Malby spoke with amazing energy about the myths surrounding what primary care needs and following the evidence rather than the policies. As the talk directly following the health secretary Matt Hancock, and his policy driven talk of video consultations based on limited evidence, this was a fantastic juxtaposition.
Encouraging us to call out the inappropriate negativity in our own ranks.
But my favourite moment of the whole conference was Helen Stokes-Lampard’s moving address where she spoke about nurturing the young generation, about hope for the future and promoting support and empowerment of the whole primary care team, not just doctors. Encouraging us to call out the inappropriate negativity in our own ranks, to collaborate and foster relationships that encourage us to succeed, not to clip our wings with cynicism. To be superhero GP’s and have faith that the one thing that will never change is the power of the doctor-patient relationship and the place we hold in the hearts of our communities. To use this to bring our profession through the turmoil we are facing and into a future filled with promise and hope. She choked up with passion and pride. And so did I, and many other people in the audience.
After the conference my overarching thoughts about my job are those of pride, not negativity. I will find patience because we are moving in a direction where I will have the time. I will be kind to my team, because they are facing the same pressures as me. I am filled with renewed vigor for the profession I love, and the patient care I provide. I came into this profession wanting to build relationships that help people. Why medicine? The perfect combination of art and science. Why general practice? I meet on average 30 new people a day, hear their problems, seek to work with them to find solutions, and build a relationship on which they may find their why. It’s an absolute privilege, and I never want to lose that.
Working together and leading each other with kindness, enthusiasm and pride.
I feel as though we have the potential to change the landscape, systematically and individually for our patients. Because it is already happening: we are expanding the primary care workforce to include a huge number of our colleagues from secondary care including paramedics and physios, we are developing new roles to help bring social solutions into our arsenal, we are finding digital solutions to the difficulty with access to primary care. We are developing areas of our practice to help fight climate change, schemes to recycle inhalers, cycle for home visits, reduce our paper use and reduce our carbon footprint. We are working on resilience. Not just individually but systemically, so when one person is struggling the whole thing doesn’t come collapsing down behind them, no one person should have the entire weight on their shoulders, like the final piece that causes the collapse in Jenga.
If, as our inspirational chair Helen Stokes Lampard says, we play Lego instead of Jenga, we can build a future where we can provide the level of care we strive for, where we enjoy going to work because we have the headspace to think around the tricky problems, and people surrounding us who help us through the tough times and celebrate the good times with us. Working together and leading each other with kindness, enthusiasm and pride. All of which were cultivated and celebrated at a hugely enjoyable conference with friends and colleagues. I can’t wait for next year.
We have been surviving individually. Now it’s time to thrive together.

GP Journal Club: the primary care–secondary care battleground
Posted by BJGP Life | 22 Apr 2016 | GP Journal Club | 0
Sampson R, Barbour R and Wilson P. The relationship between GPs and hospital consultants and the implications for patient care: a qualitative study. BMC Fam Pract 2016. 17:(1): 1-12
The next GP Journal Club is on the 8th May at 8pm. You can download the paper here.
Rammya Mathew is an academic GP at UCL and is chairing the next GP Journal Club.
Sampson et al have done a fantastic job of characterising the somewhat strained relationships that exist across the primary care-secondary care interface. On reading the paper, I couldn’t help but feel that so much of the narrative rings true of my own experiences on the frontline. I am well aware of the difficulties we face in primary care and how it can sometimes feel as though we are on the battlefield with our hospital colleagues. However, we often fail to realise that they have their own frustrations regarding our working practices, and whilst we are botch seeing the situation from our own perspectives, it is indeed the patient who becomes the victim of unintended combat.
I find it incomprehensible that we are supposedly working together for our patients, but at the same time, we struggle to pick up the phone and talk to each other. There have been times when I have patiently listened to an automated switchboard message for a whole three and a half minutes in the middle of a busy morning surgery, only to then be greeted by the glaring beep of an ominous dead tone. But what if our hospital colleagues want to speak to us – between jam-packed surgeries that are sandwiched with home visits, when do we make ourselves available to them? With an ever increasing workload, it sometimes seems unimaginable that we might be able to create the time and/or space required to enable meaningful dialogue between primary and secondary care.
In my experience, working together breeds a great sense of satisfaction but there are certain do’s and don’t, which have to be respected. I’m sure that on both sides of the fence, we are cautious of not allowing our egos to get in the way of good patient care. But when does integrated working and shared care overstep the mark and quite frankly become ‘dumping’? Recently, there has been a growing sense of frustration in primary care at the ‘GP to chase’ rhetoric, which plagues hospital discharge summaries and outpatient clinic letters. This prompted the following response on Twitter:
‘Hospital docs please, respectfully etc, note difference between GP and labrador’.
It feels like one-way traffic in general practice, but the truth is that our hospital colleagues feel equally dumped on by us. I can certainly hold my hands up and say that there have been times when I have been unable to handle the uncertainty and I have fired off a half-hearted referral, just to ease the pressure and share the load. I wouldn’t for a second blame the doctor at the receiving end for bemoaning my actions. The sad reality is that despite all the gatekeeping we do in general practice, we sometimes get it wrong and make ‘inappropriate’ referrals; when hospital wards and clinics are bursting at the seams, its unsurprising that this is greeted with great dissatisfaction. It seems as though, whilst we are sinking, we get unhelpfully defensive and look to point the finger at each another. It sometimes feels as though we purposely close our eyes to each others’ plight, just as a means of survival.
So how do we join forces on the battleground? It may sound simplistic but perhaps we need to spend more time in each others kingdoms. At the very least it would engrain reasonable expectations of what the other can do. As GPs we gain invaluable experience of hospital medicine during our training years. On the other hand, there are specialists who have never set foot in general practice, beyond undergraduate level training. This leads to misunderstandings about workload and archaic views of what GPs do. As professionals, we stand to gain a lot by coming together. Namely, respect and understanding. But if we truly succeed in breaking down institutional divides, it will be our patients who reap the benefits of holistic interdisciplinary care.
Collaborative working is of growing importance in the face of an ageing population and rising multi-morbidity, but the way in which we practice now just doesn’t allow for it. In recent years our focus in primary care has been on improving access, but some speculate as to whether this has just perpetuated spiralling demand. Every day, minor ailments walk through my door that would have resolved without any input from a GP. I sometimes feel as though we are seeing more and more patients at the expense of providing holistic and coordinated care for those who most need it. It is clear that we need to to invest in the primary care-secondary care interface for the sake of these patients, but what can we safely stop doing in order to make this happen?
Join us for the @GPJournalclub discussion at 8pm on the 8th May to discuss this paper and to explore the primary care–secondary care interface in more depth.
Feel free to leave suggestions for questions on the night – tweet me @RammyaMathew, or leave a reply in the comments box.

BJGP Long Read: Healthcare’s hole in the heart
Posted by BJGP Life | 19 Nov 2019 | BJGP Long Read | 0
David Zigmond was a small practice GP in south London 1977-2016. Read Obituary for St James Church Surgery: the death of a practice.
Can we have value for money and not lose our humanity?
Our lives lengthen, our population increases, our expectations multiply: inevitably our healthcare services need ever more resources, monitoring and coordination. Efficiency becomes crucial. Increasingly, management methods from competitive production industries have been adopted to meet these needs. Yet the results are often paradoxical and demotivating. Why is that?
In a full heart there is room for everything, in an empty heart there is room for nothing.
– Antonio Porchia, Voces, 1968
The NHS culture I have retired from has departed far from the one that tended and guided me several decades ago, at the beginning of my life as a doctor.
My working milieu has evolved a curiously unhappy amalgam: fatigued and demoralised, yet edgy and mistrustfully vigilant. This is manifest by a workforce subject to ever-increasing pressures by, and for, ‘management’: goals and targets, deadlines, directives, performance indicators, appraisals, inspections and audits.
While ever more public funds and resources are ring-fenced for healthcare, the morale of its servants continues to plummet.
Such executive devices have, perversely, caused the loss of the very human satisfactions that make our difficult work worthwhile: personally invested relationships with both colleagues and patients, the flexibility and time spans that enable our most human types of holism – the ability to both perceive and mould how this particular diagnosis or intervention relates to this particular life and its relationships.
The losses of such personal meaning and gratification in our NHS workforce causes widespread destruction. This is reflected in many statistics: rates of sickness, career abandonment, intraorganisational litigation, earliest retirement, drug and alcohol abuse, suicide – all these have markedly increased.
Mostly undocumented, but very telling, is the growing discrepancy between the privately uttered and the publicly avowed: what is disclosed in quiet sequestered conversations is very different to the vaunted presentation in the conference room or official document. I am told that such fearful and hidden dissonance and loss of integrity premonitored the cynical and exhausted collapse of the Soviet Union.
All of these morbid signs have been generated, then accelerated, in the last two decades. This has happened usually because of serial service redesigns, hardly ever in spite of them. While ever more public funds and resources are ring-fenced for healthcare, the morale of its servants continues to plummet: at the heart of our Welfare we seem to have created a kind of human black hole.
Yet we have learned to revere our health service as a kind of Welfare Crown Jewel. Politicians of all hues understandably want quick and decisive reversals to any sign of degradation: the motivations are usually mixtures of public interest and anxiety about their job tenure. Their public statements are, therefore, designed to sound resolute, muscular and galvanic. ‘Driving up standards’ is a standard and safe mantra; ‘Declaring all-out war on mediocrity’ seems more desperate and courts the absurd. Both were stated by Cabinet Ministers.
Both of the phrases are worth some analysis: they are good examples of how we may exacerbate problems by simplistic judgements or plans.
First, ‘the war on mediocrity’. What can this mean? The mediocre is an average, so how would we identify it as an opposition force? Then how do we eliminate it without another ‘mediocrity’ arising? The rhetoric has much bluster, but little sense. ‘Driving up standards’ may seem more cogent but induces many problems. We talk about ‘driving’ cattle, chemical processes or motor vehicles: it is a phrase that implies dominance and control, and thus complete submission of the driven. This brings us to the crux of a very important question, one central to the motivational psychology, and then management, of our welfare services: what is the best way to get other people to care for yet more other people?
Operationally, do we need more sticks and carrots? Why does this not work better? Is there something we are missing? Is it trust?
***
Our best welfare is not like a manufactured chemical process; it is much more like a child, or at least a complex living tissue. In both of these survival, then sustainable growth, need a protected environment and nurture quite as much as any control. Expecting good welfare to evolve and thrive in an oppressively controlled working environment is like expecting a happy and creative individual to emerge from a family that is determined by many inflexible rules – it rarely happens.
Yet this is what we have set up in our welfare services. Our advanced industrial culture is now so accustomed to being able to design and manufacture objects that service our wishes, that we assume we can do the same with our complex human needs and interactions. Often we have been able to short-circuit complex natural processes. Sometimes this has been expediently successful, but cumulatively it has led to any ‘family’ ethos of Welfare being commandeered as a kind of factory process. What does this mean? Here are two scenarios, separated by forty years, to illustrate and explain.
***
1972. Frank’s Flower Bed. Mental Hospital. Outer London.
As a young psychiatrist I worked in a large and handsomely stalwart Victorian building set amidst extensive, landscaped and well-tended grounds. It had a staff canteen – a cheerfully clamorous space offering unpretentious, good-enough, home-cooked food and the opportunity for easy and informal colleagueial contact. Several times there I opportunistically lunched and talked with Frank, the Hospital Administrator. Frank was about thirty years older than me, with an unintrusively warm and avuncular manner. He liked, when possible, to talk to staff members and (those that wanted to) patients.
I remember occasionally continuing our conversations beyond the canteen, sauntering along the paths connecting the many lawns, flower beds, massed rhododendrons and azaleas. Tending these were small groups of patients to whom – the longer-term ones – Frank signalled a friendly recognition. Frank and I were interested in one another’s roles and perspectives. He told me how he had started working at this hospital as an eighteen-year-old wages clerk. He had slowly ‘worked his way up’.
Frank was interested my young, questioning, ‘freshman’s’ view of his long-served job and ancient institution. I described my experience of working in this large, sequestered working community as like being in a village, in which he was the Mayor. He smiled with cautious pride. ‘Yes’, he said, ‘I suppose it is that kind of community. Well, I hope it’s mostly a welcoming village for you to work in, and that I’m a worthy Mayor’.
Frank’s tender planting was a small act from a large heart and mind: an investment that could take root.
My last image of Frank was unusual and it remains sharp in my memory. At the front of the hospital was a rather grand porticoed entrance. This itself was symmetrically flanked by a few parking spaces for staff beyond which there was a small, lawned roundabout with a central flower bed. Having finished work late one midsummer evening I saw an incongruous crouched figure, indistinct in the fading light. It was Frank planting a flowering shrub. My understanding lagged behind my greeting.
‘Oh! Frank … What are you doing?’ I asked with friendly perplexity.
Frank firmed and patted the last of the anchoring soil and looked up.
‘I thought this would bring a bit of life and colour to this rather neglected flower bed,’ he explained, glancing briefly with affection at the shrub.
‘When it blossoms you’ll see it from your office window.’ I wanted him to receive some of his own beneficence.
‘Yes…’ he looked around ‘a lot of people will see it… ‘. He paused and exhaled a soft, low sigh of satisfied completion and anticipation. ‘I hope a lot of people will still see it well after I’m gone, too…’
His smile seemed poignant and intimate: an inexplicit intimation of our universal mortality.
***
I had always liked Frank’s unegotistical and humble personal pride in his work, which he enacted with such unassuming but steadfast public service: that was why I liked to walk and talk with him. Even at the time of this affecting yet brief encounter and dialogue, I realised it captured something subtle and precious with a poetic economy. Frank’s tender planting was a small act from a large heart and mind: an investment that could take root and enhance not only his life, but others’ and other times. As far as I know, Frank’s working life was long, stable and otherwise unremarkable. He received little public recognition.
He was called an Administrator.
***
2015. Brenda’s Business Support. Frontline General Practice. Inner London.
It is now four years into the Health and Social Care Act. This legislation was introduced stealthily, amidst much confusion: it was implemented (just) with assurances that it would free GPs from the growing bureaucratic mire and so empower them to make speedy and accurate decisions for the patients and localities that they supposedly know well. This last notion is a serious misconception, as GPs have largely lost their special vantage point for personal and vernacular knowledge.
GPs are now discovering just how complex are decisions of public healthcare policy… and how different these are to the skills of doctor-patient encounters.
More broadly this is contributing to an unleashing of the Law of Unintended Consequences whose effects are far more durable than the political and rhetorical slogans that spawned them. GPs are now discovering just how complex are decisions of public healthcare policy and administration, and how different (however connected) these are to the skills of doctor-patient encounters.
Frustrations about the demands of the massive new tasks are very substantial. Even worse is the way that doctors are further depleted of their already dwindling head and heart-space: the intellectual and emotional opportunities for personally invested and gratifying work with patients. Instead, their vocational energies are officiously abducted into conduits to serve a public utility.
These initiatives – turning all professional activity, interchange and mental life into publicly managed commodities – have inadvertently displaced, and then destroyed, the powerful yet subtle personal nuances that are the vitalising human heart of our personal healthcare.
***
Alarms are being raised about this, but no-one seems to be able to stem the rising tide of bureaucratic directives and incentives – the floodwater drowning us with such a massive volume of depersonalised stress and exhaustion.
Over many years I have issued dozens of invitations to managers and politicians to sit in with me, in a surgery session. We could then share, in vivo, experiences and notions directly from the front-line. My invitations have never been taken up. Often the declination has been explained by other ‘more essential’ meetings and commitments. Even if veracious, there is another never articulated truth: ‘We cannot deal with real experiences; we can only process abstracted representations of these.’ This is the thin end of an important wedge: one often signalling the nemesis of all those taking responsibility for others.
Ignoring such signs and alarms seems perilous to me. I repeatedly try to raise this at our professional (Clinical Commissioning Group) meetings: each time I am told that the Agenda is already full of essential administrative matters, and that these meetings, in any case, are an incorrect forum for my concerns. I ask where and when can we publicly discuss such crucial and perverse discrepancies? I receive no answer. Yet I am receiving some dark encouragement: for at other times colleagues seek me out in private spaces to express their hidden frustration, resentment and fear: the broken life energies behind the bad statistics.
***
In an effort to assure open discussion I continue my efforts to contact a manager. They, surely, can ensure that this is put on an Agenda. This is proving tricky. If emails are answered it is with officially phrased dissemblance or procrastination. More often they lie unattended in a cyberdump.
Personal conversations are required. I telephone the relevant manager but cannot get through: I leave messages with assistants and an answerphone. I persist.
On my last attempt I am put through to a voice that sounds to me clipped, correct and uninterested in involving herself in anything she cannot authoritatively answer. However, she responds confidently to my questions of designation: she is a Business Support Manager and her name is Brenda. I ask what her role entails and her reply seems stiff with bureaucratese: ‘corporate strategy’, ‘integration of multidisciplinary planning’, ‘interface communication between Trusts in Commissioning implementations’… Her voice has the sing-song cadence of an official on autopilot. My attention soon drifts away.
I am thinking how distant are the worlds that Brenda and I inhabit. The welfare work I have been doing for many years is very different from what she calls a ‘business’. And who is she ‘supporting’? I can imagine her ‘supporting’ some commissioning or auditing initiative … I cannot imagine her supporting me.
‘How can I help you?’ Brenda cuts across my disengaged reverie with a brusquely managerial tone.
I briefly explain what I want to put on our meeting’s agenda: the collapse of NHS staff morale and rise of staff sickness and career abandonment.
Her voice cools further to a crystalline formality. ‘I’m not, strictly speaking, the right manager for you to speak to. I’ll pass your message on. Somebody will get back to you.’
***
Three weeks later. Nobody has.
Who does Brenda support?
While I am pondering these questions, my mind is crossed by another, tragicomic, notion: how I would rather be a junior shrub in Frank’s flower-bed than a senior doctor in Brenda’s business-supported NHS

The onesie: a red flag sign for GPs
Posted by Adam Staten | 27 Feb 2015 | Clinical, Opinion, Random | 2
Adam Staten is a GP trainee in Surrey and is on Twitter @adamstaten.
Cold reading is the art of obtaining information about a person by making a rapid assessment of their body language, manner, age, dress and behaviour. It is commonly used by psychics, mediums and illusionists. General practitioners do it too, whether it’s noticing the subtle nail changes in an undiagnosed psoriatic, or clocking the smell of stale alcohol on the problem drinker.
We find clues about patients all over them and all around them. In exams the signs are usually obvious, it may be the inhaler and BM monitor carelessly left by the bedside or a medic alert necklace turned face down on the chest. In practice signs may be less obvious, less tangible, but equally revealing. Your recognition of these signs may not be conscious but they form part of your assessment none the less; the fifteen year soft neck collar of the somatising patient, the midwinter tinted glasses of generalised oddness, or the teddy bear sign of pseudoseizures are a few examples.
Dress, in particular, is one of the key components of the mental state exam but judging it can be tricky. One man’s chic is another man’s psychotic. However there is one item of clothing that requires no interpretation. There is one item of clothing that is a clear cry for help. You may have found yourself in the consultation room struggling to listen to a middle aged woman’s account of her sore throat or aching knees because you can’t stop wondering why this grown woman is wearing a Babygro®.
[bctt tweet=”BJGP Blog: Struggling to listen because a grown woman is wearing a Babygro®?” via=”no”]
Rather than resisting this thought process you should embrace it. This is the era of holistic medicine and all patients are supposed to be seen as part of their bio-psycho-social milieu. The onesie is a gift to the busy, time pressured, general practitioner because it is the psycho-social snapshot par excellence.
This is an item of clothing that declares to the world that a patient lacks the gumption and will power to struggle into a second garment. It is an item of clothing that declares to the world that an adult’s self-worth has sunk so low that he does not mind being seen in public dressed as a baby. The wearing in public of a onesie by anyone over the age of two years should be considered a clinical sign, Staten’s sign if you will, of extreme psycho-social distress and should prompt an urgent mental state assessment.
The evidence supporting this new clinical sign lies somewhere just below grade 5 and thus it is an area requiring further research. Yet it seems likely an extra question will be added to the PHQ-9, ‘on how many days in the last two weeks have you worn a onesie in public?’. Be vigilant, if your patient is onesie positive, then they are in need.

Her kids were in matching onesies.

If there is no underwear in that onesie, then you need to bring her back in a week.

Why Slazenger’s cat explains global warming
Posted by David Misselbrook | 19 Sep 2016 | Opinion, Random | 1
I admit that Slazenger’s cat is a red herring, but my wife was in a rail carriage a while ago, close to a small group of friends in earnest discussion. One was trying to refer to the paradox of Schrödinger’s cat, but couldn’t quite remember the name, so it came out as Slazenger’s cat, which has remained within our family folklore hereafter. But the cat that explains global warming is owned by a friend, a mathematician rather than a quantum physicist. They were faced with the perennial question – what to do with the cat when they go on holiday?
Our friend here in Bahrain flees home to Canada for the summer (well, Canada does not reach 48°C in August). Mr Tibbles never goes out of their flat. So a fairly routine problem of care you would think? They have an additional problem. Should one just leave the air conditioning on continuously for 6 weeks, risking it breaking down when they are not there, thus killing the cat through heat exhaustion? Their Arab helper (whom they employ to wash their cars) will care for the cat. He is competent, although illiterate. So they give the helper a key. At the helper’s request they lock all the internal doors except for the room with the cat. The helper turns on the air con every morning when the cat gets fed, and turns it off every night, when the outdoor temperature will go down to the low 30°C. All should be well.
Except of course it isn’t. The air con in the cat’s room breaks down just as they are leaving for the airport. Fine, put the cat in another room and let the helper know. But the helper has no phone (and is still illiterate). So my friend’s children rapidly draw diagrams and maps of the layout of the flat with large arrows on walls leading a path to the cat’s new abode, a room with functioning air con. And of course my friend spends the summer in the same state of suspended belief as Slazenger, Schrödinger, whoever.
But this rather shaggy tale explains why this part of the world is not going to cut back on its carbon emissions any time soon. I am sitting writing this with the air con on. It’s a few degrees cooler today, only 43°C. We turn the air con off when we are out, to give it a rest, but there’s no way we could live by day or sleep by night without it. But, hey, energy from oil powered power stations is so cheap out here. We don’t get an electricity bill – it’s not worth it, it’s just bundled up into the rent because it’s as cheap as chips. (Well, considerably cheaper than chips to be accurate.) And our lush green apartment gardens would be dry and dead in days without the unending power hungry efforts of the local desalination plant – well it rains four days a year and there are no rivers in Bahrain – where do you think the water comes from? Oh, and I haven’t mentioned our apartment’s two 500,000 litre swimming pools. Desalinating water for both of them would take about 28 car petrol tanks of fuel, enough to drive from the UK to New Zealand (although I wouldn’t advise trying it).
As I look out of my window over the blue waters of the Gulf and the squat square rooves of my neighbours I can see plenty of jet skis and high end cars but no solar panels. (I didn’t even know they made a five-litre Jaguar until I came out here.) So the Middle East won’t be giving up its reliance on fossil fuels any time soon. And what of the rest of the world? Despite what I have seen of refugee camps in this region and slums in African townships, poverty in most parts of the emerging world is reducing overall. And to what does the emerging world aspire? To a low impact organic recycled utopia, or to air con, MacDonalds and five litre Jaguars? I’ll leave you to guess.
I love a line our daughter wrote on her website: “when we throw something away, where do we think away is?” We make rather feeble attempts to live a low-impact life that is actually impossible as an ex-pat in the Middle East (and in any case is trumped by our air miles travelling home a few times a year.) And the west is still obsessed with “growth”. Actually the west is all grown up and just a bit too big. Should we not be obsessed with stabilizing our planet? It’s our way of life that needs to become more resilient, not our GPs. Grown-ups putting on weight is not healthy and it’s time we attended to our planet’s BMI.
By the way, the air con worked fine – Mr Tibbles lives.

This is really interesting – especially where you mention the reliance on air conditioning. The lack of water in your area also sounds concerning but hey, global warming right? Really interesting, thanks!

Bristol and Exeter Student GP societies: working hard to promote general practice
Posted by BJGP Life | 26 Nov 2015 | Undergraduate | 2
Alice James is a 4th year medical student at Bristol University. She is passionate about promoting general practice to other students in her role as Chair of the University GP Society (Bristol GPSoc) and student representative for the Severn Faculty RCGP.
Nilakshini is a 4th year medical student based in Exeter and is passionate about general practice. She believes it’s time to put the stigma associated with primary care behind us and start giving recognition for the challenging and exciting career that it really is.
The Bristol and Exeter Student GP societies aim to inspire members to consider a career in general practice through showcasing general practice as a versatile and fulfilling career and by challenging the stigmas associated with the profession by addressing controversial issues in the field. The societies provide CV-boosting advice, information about the GP training programme and hold events involving GPs with backgrounds ranging from conservation medicine and broadcast journalism to GPs with specialist interests.
Exeter student GP society, founded only in 2015, has initiated monthly practical teaching sessions for students in their pre-clinical years. This has been very popular so far and we are hoping to extend this mentoring scheme for students in their clinical years as well. This year the GP society are excited to introduce our inaugural debate under the auspices of Devon and Exeter Medical Society, ‘Are the increasing portion of female doctors, a key contributor for GP shortages?’. We hope that by addressing relevant and topical issues we can successfully challenge the negative stigmas associated with a career in general practice. Holding the event with the Devon and Exeter Medical society also provides students the opportunity meet and interact with general practitioners who are passionate about their career.
Bristol GPSoc, now in its 4th year, is planning to extend their annual conference to a full-day event to include student poster presentations and added workshops. The society is also planning a clinical skills workshop suitable for both pre-clinical and clinical years as an OSCE revision session. As well as stand-alone events, Bristol GPSoc has also joined forces with other University and Bristol-based societies. Last week the society held its first event of the year: ‘Mental Health: The Psychiatry-Primary Care Interface’ together with the Bristol University psychiatry society (PsychSoc). We heard from 2 local GPs, a consultant liaison psychiatrist and the founder of the mental health charity ‘Student Minds’. The 4 speakers addressed different ways of promoting better mental health by exemplifying methods used in their working environments. Approaches included peer support groups, self-care smart phone apps and services offered within GP services themselves including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and self-hypnosis.
Both societies have benefited hugely from support given by local RCGP Faculties. Exeter GP society would like to thank Tamar Faculty for the funding and GP reading list which they have kindly provided. Furthermore, Tamar Faculty RCGP have recently co- opted the Chair of Exeter GPSoc onto their board as student representative. Following this, Bristol GPSoc enquired whether Severn Faculty RCGP had would be willing to open up a similar role on their board at the next AGM. As a result, the current Bristol GPSoc Chair was elected as the Severn Faculty student representative at the start of this month. Severn Faculty also allows other students to attend board meetings as observers and provides elective bursaries every year for Bristol students undertaking an elective within a primary care setting.
University backing is also essential to the development of student GP societies. Bristol GPSoc committee members have been invited to GP teacher training days and have been involved in the University-wide curriculum review by the Centre for Academic Primary Care. In addition, the University of Bristol medical student society (Galenicals) have given support by advertising events, providing funding and holding a medical student Freshers’ fair to promote student-led societies. Exeter Medical school also played a key role in setting up the GP society and are often good port of contact for the committee members.
At the most recent RCGP conference, one of the RCGP Associate in Training (AiT) committee representatives, Jodie Blackadder-Coward, organised a meeting for student GPSoc representatives from around the UK. This provided an opportunity to communicate ideas that we can then relay to a national body. Suggestions discussed by students and RCGP committee members included formal affiliation of GPSocs with the college, guidance on elective opportunities in primary care and deliberation of having a foundation year doctor on their GP committee.
Support from the RCGP and individual Universities will be fundamental to the continued growth and development of GP societies and to facilitate communication between them. We hope
both Severn and Tamar RCGP Faculties will continue to advertise the role of student representative to medical students in future years and that other RCGP Faculties will follow suit. Such opportunities have enabled both societies to voice our ideas and concerns with the hope of making an impact at both the undergraduate and specialty training level. The recently forged links between the GP Societies at the Universities of Exeter, Plymouth, Bristol and Cardiff have allowed us to share ideas and extend invitations to events. We have also discussed the prospect of a collaborative event to attract students and junior doctors from across the South West.

Great work both of you. It is so important that general practice has an equal and accurate voice within our medical schools. Enthusiasm like this rubs off and I hope will generate a wave of new talent into primary care at a time of high demand but great opportunity for innovation. Being a GP is a great job but we do need more of us to make it as good as it can be.

Hi Alice and Nilakshini,
I understand that the UK is short of general practitioners. I am a dutch medical student in my final year and am thinking of becoming GP. I would like to experience what it is like in the UK(Bristol). Can you put me in touch with someone who will take me on for some weeks in the summer?

Brexit and statins: a tale of scepticism
Posted by BJGP Life | 7 Sep 2016 | Opinion, Political, Undergraduate | 0
Christien Fortune is a final year medical student at The University of Manchester and has interests in cardiology and medical education.
In the fabled land of post-June 23rd Britain and Northern Ireland, politics in the UK has been understandably dominated by the UK’s decision to exit the European Union. Vote Leave’s successful campaign, in part, utilised the public’s deep seated suspicion of the juggernaut that is the multinational political union of the European Union; one that in the eyes of the “Brexiteers” yielded little benefit despite its large cost to the UK. What was remarkable was the resonation of Leave’s message with the older population; according to YouGov poll over 64% of over-65s voted to leave the EU.1 The merits of EU membership can be debated until the end of time, but something which is unequivocally clear is that the older generation, in general, did not want to be part of the EU.1
As a casual observer of the UK political scene and avid viewer of the BBC programme, Question Time, I couldn’t help seeing striking parallels between the public attitude towards the EU and another juggernaut, this time of the pharmacological variety. To understand the aspersions surrounding statins is bewildering; at the time of writing, a Cochrane review of 19 studies assessing the value of statins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease revealed a marked reduction in all-cause mortality, major vascular events and revascularisation.2 Objectively, it seems unmistakably clear that statins have a major role to play in preventing our cardiovascular disease-baiting, overweight country. Unfortunately, the very nature of opinion does not lie in objectivity. In my admittedly limited experience, I have found a sizeable number of older patients sceptical about the benefits of statins. In broad agreement with my anecdotes, a study looking at adherence in secondary disease prevention for coronary artery disease in a US population revealed that consistent use of lipid-lowering therapy was 44%.3 The US does have other financial factors which will play a role in adherence, however, I’m sure that for certain healthcare professionals, this message will sound familiar. It is interesting that in the case of both the European Union and statins, scepticism seems to be the default setting of the UK’s older generation. Why is it that for a demographic, we (either Remain or medical professionals, take your pick) fail to convince them of a benefit which may be inconspicuous?
Although the older generation’s relationship with statins doesn’t pose quite as bigger problem to the future of our economy as the Referendum result will, it does still have important ramifications to an individual’s cardiovascular-related mortality. A failure to address the unhealthy relationship in those who are wary about the effects of statins has the potential to detrimentally affect the very lives we seek to care for. In a Scottish population, those who were compliant with statin use were more likely to have had the consequences of hyperlipidaemia emphasised.4 Tolmie et al also highlighted the need to a regular addressing of any concerns patients may have in order to prevent patients discontinuing medication without letting their doctor know.4 At the same time, there has to be some serious PR to promote the undoubted benefits of statins in the appropriate cohorts.
Interestingly enough, as was the case in the referendum, a major stumbling block in convincing the public about the benefits of their respective causes is the work of the tabloids. In a 15-day period, the Daily Mail published articles on their website with the following titles, “Statins ‘may be waste of time’…”,5 “Millions of people may be needlessly taking statins every day…”6 and “Don’t give up your statins…”.7 This startling contradiction indicates the type of mixed messages that the public is being told; it is unreasonable to expect the general public to be able critically analyse the underlying research and human nature means that the take home message will be the title in bold above the text. Naturally, this type of journalism creates the perfect conditions to promote widespread reservations about statin use. Therefore, it is up to healthcare professionals to combat the seeds of doubt surrounding statin use and provide a clear and coherent message about the advantage of using statins.
Now, the ship may have sailed across the Channel with respect to the UK’s membership but its sister ship containing some positivity about statins is still in the docks, albeit with increasingly frayed moorings. As doctors, we need to make sure that we shore up the public’s trust in statins; it is, of course, in their interest and that is something that it is easy to overlook.

The onesie: a red flag sign for GPs
Posted by Adam Staten | 27 Feb 2015 | Clinical, Opinion, Random | 2
Adam Staten is a GP trainee in Surrey and is on Twitter @adamstaten.
Cold reading is the art of obtaining information about a person by making a rapid assessment of their body language, manner, age, dress and behaviour. It is commonly used by psychics, mediums and illusionists. General practitioners do it too, whether it’s noticing the subtle nail changes in an undiagnosed psoriatic, or clocking the smell of stale alcohol on the problem drinker.
We find clues about patients all over them and all around them. In exams the signs are usually obvious, it may be the inhaler and BM monitor carelessly left by the bedside or a medic alert necklace turned face down on the chest. In practice signs may be less obvious, less tangible, but equally revealing. Your recognition of these signs may not be conscious but they form part of your assessment none the less; the fifteen year soft neck collar of the somatising patient, the midwinter tinted glasses of generalised oddness, or the teddy bear sign of pseudoseizures are a few examples.
Dress, in particular, is one of the key components of the mental state exam but judging it can be tricky. One man’s chic is another man’s psychotic. However there is one item of clothing that requires no interpretation. There is one item of clothing that is a clear cry for help. You may have found yourself in the consultation room struggling to listen to a middle aged woman’s account of her sore throat or aching knees because you can’t stop wondering why this grown woman is wearing a Babygro®.
[bctt tweet=”BJGP Blog: Struggling to listen because a grown woman is wearing a Babygro®?” via=”no”]
Rather than resisting this thought process you should embrace it. This is the era of holistic medicine and all patients are supposed to be seen as part of their bio-psycho-social milieu. The onesie is a gift to the busy, time pressured, general practitioner because it is the psycho-social snapshot par excellence.
This is an item of clothing that declares to the world that a patient lacks the gumption and will power to struggle into a second garment. It is an item of clothing that declares to the world that an adult’s self-worth has sunk so low that he does not mind being seen in public dressed as a baby. The wearing in public of a onesie by anyone over the age of two years should be considered a clinical sign, Staten’s sign if you will, of extreme psycho-social distress and should prompt an urgent mental state assessment.
The evidence supporting this new clinical sign lies somewhere just below grade 5 and thus it is an area requiring further research. Yet it seems likely an extra question will be added to the PHQ-9, ‘on how many days in the last two weeks have you worn a onesie in public?’. Be vigilant, if your patient is onesie positive, then they are in need.

If there is no underwear in that onesie, then you need to bring her back in a week.

Poems for Doctors: a video
Posted by BJGP Life | 18 Sep 2018 | Arts | 0
Written by Lesley Morrison. This year, for the fourth year, all Scottish medical graduates were gifted Tools of the Trade, the little pocket sized book of poetry published by the Scottish Poetry Library and intended to provide support for new doctors as they embark on their very demanding new professional lives, and to encourage their creativity.
In collaboration with the Scottish Poetry Library, the School of Medicine at the University of St Andrews University Medical School has produced lovely video recordings of some of the poems and the latest was released on 5th July as a 70th birthday present for the NHS. The recordings and the story of the project, taken forward thanks to the support of the dean, Professor David Crossman, and other senior staff members and the expertise of Steve Smart, poet, visual artist, and information designer, can be heard and read at
http://med.st-andrews.ac.uk/poemsfordoctors/ .
The readings are by medical professionals and students who have chosen a poem for particular reasons or resonances which they describe, and they are moving and powerful.
Each reading provides a seed for informal discussion in a Facebook group managed by a group of experienced doctors. The intention is to facilitate an online discussion about these very relevant and affecting issues and conditions and in doing so to foster a community of encouragement and support.
A video installation of the readings has been on site at St Andrews Medical School and been taken to several conferences and seminars.
Listen, enjoy, reflect and pass on!
Work is about to begin on the third edition of “Tools of the Trade” (the second edition sold out!) which further feeds into the work of the Scottish medical humanities group promoting the introduction of more medical humanities into Scottish medical schools curricula
(www.scottishmedicalhumanities.org).
For teachers, the Scottish Poetry Library has recently published an equivalent beautiful little book, Learn for the future, available through the website, www.spl.org.

Bright Ideas: improving access to digital health resources
Posted by BJGP Life | 9 Apr 2018 | Bright Ideas and Innovation | 0
QR info pods to provide waiting room resources
Steffan Gimblett of Pontardawe Primary Care Centre, Swansea was the winner of the inaugural Bright Ideas Awards in Wales.
The problem:
Our reception area was very cluttered with posters and didn’t communicate information to patients in a good way. We have an up to date website but we didn’t seem to promote online services to patients at all. We were spending a lot of money on printing leaflets and documents and needed to cut our costs and our carbon footprint.
The Bright Idea:
We produced a QR info pod for patients which contained links to all our online services, social media and relevant information about the practice. It also contains:
Links to an A-Z guide of self-help resources, including downloadable leaflets and videos
A section on local health initiatives
A section dedicated to vaccine resources and information
A section dedicated to UK wide health information such as antibiotics awareness, how to give blood and how to choose the right service.
Patients simply scan the code using their smartphone and they have instant access to the digital information we want them to see. We are also able to use Google Analytics to track how often each QR code is scanned giving us a way to measure the use of the pods. The system took six months to set up. We audited which documents we printed the most and decided what we wanted to communicate most to patients. We then contacted design and digital companies for prototypes and agreed on the best design.
The QR pods cost £280 to produce, however we are now saving at least £90 per month in print costs alone with additional savings on staff time and less administration. This monthly saving has recovered the costs of the pods. The digital interaction has enabled the use of a new way to engage with patients and get feedback.
The impact:
Patients. Availability to scan practice and health information to their smart phone to be read at a time convenient to them.
There has been great feedback from patients for the effort put into communicating with patients.
Workforce. Time saved on having to identify and print documents for patients.
Practice. We have experience an upsurge in our Twitter followers and online registrations of nearly 300%.
There has been a drastic drop in the amount of forms we print for patients as they can be scanned, leading to practice cost savings.
We are now working with Barnardos, Childline, the NSPCC and the Police as they have asked us to design and produce a QR Info Pod aimed at 11-19 year olds promoting the services they offer.

Bright Ideas for General Practice
The RCGP’s Bright Ideas initiative recognises that GPs and practice staff regularly see opportunities to improve their practice, and often do so by taking a fresh and innovative approach. We want these new approaches to be recognised, celebrated and shared, to inspire other practices to consider implementing ideas which have been successful elsewhere to address issues in their practice and to encourage innovative thinking across general practice.

The Future of Medicine
Posted by Roger Jones | 11 Mar 2020 | Opinion | 0
Professor Roger Jones is the Editor of the British Journal of General Practice.
The Changing Face of Medicine project is gathering momentum.
As President of the BMA, Professor Pali Hungin launched a project to look into the impact of fast moving technological advances, the shifting role of the doctor, the adequacy of medical education, the nature of public and patient expectations of clinicians, the need for visionary medical leadership, and the well-being of clinicians themselves. This is the Changing Face of Medicine (CFOM) project, which held a conference at the Kings Fund, under the auspices of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, on 27th February 2020. Professor Hungin hoped that the meeting would open the way to a formal, long-term process, embracing social, clinical and technological contributors. By the end of a fascinating day, it was clear that this is a conversation that is urgently required now and will be needed for some time in the future.
Part of the impetus for this process was, of course, the recruitment, retention and morale crisis facing medicine. Acknowledging that parameters such as the ideal numbers of medical students and doctors required are uncertain, Professor Michael Farthing, chair of the CFOM faculty group and formerly Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sussex, considered the effects of new roles and new technologies on the need for continuing “medical” input, recognising that the evidence at present suggests that these additional resources may have more to do with enhancing the quality of care than substituting for clinicians. He reminded us that UK levels of medical staffing are well below the EU average. Developing this theme, Professor Hungin reflected on the gradual falling-off in numbers of medical graduates proceeding to specialist training. He was pessimistic about the future of continuity of care, despite the evidence of its value. He emphasised the central importance of patients and their expectations and highlighted Donald Irvine’s concept of “active patient autonomy“. He wondered if there might even be dangers to doctors’ own well-being in clinging to core values such as empathy and compassion, although he acknowledged that human contact would always trump technology.
Professor Derek Alderson, President of the Royal College of Surgeons, gave an exhilarating overview of the implications of technological and other medical advances on surgery and healthcare, casting his net widely to include imaging, robotics, robot assisted surgery, 3-D bioprinting of tissues and organs, and neural prostheses. New surgical and clinical skills will have to be developed in the context of a focus on patient safety, surgical education and leadership and, perhaps most important of all, the development of a robust evidence base to support surgical innovations. He saw the current National Trainee Research Collaboratives as having a critical role in encouraging clinical studies and successful research collaborations in the future, and went onto show how surgery had a global importance in terms of improving health outcomes, citing surgical treatment of club foot and fistula as life-changing interventions.
Professor Sheona MacLeod, Deputy Director or Medical Education reform at Health Education England, looked at what was in the medical education pipeline that might support rapid professional and technological change. The Medical Educational Reform Program emphasises increased mobility in training, better educational support and supervision, and greater alignment with geographical needs. Scenario planning, looking at different possible future is for medicine and society, has been used to explore ways in which medical education curricula can be “flexed“ to take account of changing patterns of care. Future challenges included multimorbidity, the increasing complexities of care, workforce demands, the need for lifelong learning, the need to respond to geographical variation, with workforce planning based on local morbidities, and deploying different staff with different competencies to work in different locations. Dr Charlie Bell, the National Medical Director’s clinical fellow, picked up some of these themes, thinking about how medical education before and after medical school needs to develop, challenging the need to necessarily recruit the most “academic“ students, and also challenging us to think about exactly what we are training medical students for, while emphasising the importance of sustainability, social justice and ethics in any curriculum..
Patients have less access to their medical records than they do to their car maintenance log.
In a very affecting presentation Jocelyn Cornwell, a medical sociologist and anthropologist, and founder of the Point of Care Foundation, considered the hazards of crystal ball gazing, citing the current downturn in life expectancy, and the rapid rise in mental health problems among young people as two unexpected and unpredictable events. She urged a focus on human relationships which she feared might be moving towards the periphery of medicine, rather than being at its centre, identifying the key drivers of patient satisfaction as trust, responsiveness and teamwork. Trust, she thought, was being eroded. Patients have less access to their medical records than they do to their car maintenance log. Doctor to doctor clinic letters which are not copied to patients represent a ‘straightforwardly infantilising behaviour’: as recently as two years ago the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges felt it necessary to issue guidance to say that it was good practice to write outpatient letters to patients. Why isn’t there a campaign for a fully patient-held medical record? Although the gravitational pull of the concept of shared decision-making is great, embraced by policymakers and regarded as perhaps ending medical paternalism, it contains within it the potential for coercion, raising issues of self-efficacy and sometimes resulting in a ‘paternalistic failure to share expert knowledge’. She was concerned about the lack of support for the well-being of NHS staff, which needs to be much more visible and more available – staff can’t care for patients if nobody cares for them. The NHS is a dilapidated and unsuitable environment, with antiquated IT, many workarounds, poor continuity, and often casual management. There is a lot to do!
Every patient wants to be treated as a person not a case, with an emphasis on transparency and trust.
Patricia Wilkie, President of the National Association for Patient Participation set out her manifesto for 2040. Every patient wants to be treated as a person not a case, with an emphasis on transparency and trust. They should have direct access to their medical records and perhaps direct access to test ordering and communication of results. Letters should always be addressed to the patient and copied to the general practitioner. By 2040 public and patients will have learnt to work with other healthcare professionals, be aware of the costs to the NHS of their treatment, and will work in partnership with doctors to encourage self-management. They will still want to discuss sensitive and embarrassing issues with a doctor they know and trust and will want access to an expert generalist to make diagnostic and management decisions. The therapeutic power of the face-to-face relationship cannot be overestimated. GPs and pharmacists should work together with patients on polypharmacy, and by 2040 doctors and patients must be working together to hold management to account. GPs will need to strike a new deal with patients, recognising their mutual responsibilities.
Sir Mark Caulfield, Chief Scientist for Genomics, opened his Pandora’s Box of genomics, revealing the glittering prizes that we might anticipate in the years ahead. The 100,000 Genomes Project, the Accelerating Detection of Disease programme and UK BioBank offer a heady mixture of genetic technologies. Rapid automated analytic methods have enabled very fast genomic analysis capable of identifying abnormalities in a number of rare diseases, which were previously almost impossible to diagnose and treat. A huge amount of energetic research activity is taking place around cystic fibrosis, Gaucher’s and Fabry syndromes, Huntington’s disease, haemophilia, and mRNA diseases, as well, of course, as cancer. This new investigative and therapeutic landscape will inevitably have major implications for the training and clinical roles of doctors, as well as the ways in which they interact with non-clinicians and patients, although the nature of these changes is not yet clear.
England’s Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty offered an extremely elegant vision of the future of medicine and the medical profession, using some very cleverly-chosen data such as changing fertility rates and population “replacement rates“ across Europe, and their implications for changes in future population demographics and consequent health needs. He looked at changes in the balance between urbanicity and rurality and the resulting changes in the location of patients with multimorbidity. There will be a steady increase in the concentration of multimorbidity in people at the oldest end of the age spectrum, along with changing patterns of multimorbidity involving cancer, cardiovascular disease and dementia, clustering of co-morbidities, and changes in disease geography. These all have implications for the distribution and skill mix required of the medical workforce. He pointed out that although there have been major improvements in survival rates for many cancers, other health indicators in the UK are not so good: we are not in the top tier of OECD countries for neonatal health for example. Increasing multimorbidity means that the proportion of life lived in poor health will inevitably increase and this will dominate medical demand and activity in the years ahead.
Doctors’ skills lie in diagnostic decision making, but complex therapeutics might be better handled by other professionals.
Looking to the future we will need to tackle multi morbidity more seriously, look much harder at case-mix and changes in the geographical distribution of disease, encourage different working patterns to respond to these, and become more serious about understanding and modifying demand. The roles of different healthcare professionals will also need to be re-defined; one example might be the separation of diagnosis from therapeutics. Doctors’ skills lie in diagnostic decision making, but complex therapeutics might be better handled by other professionals. We will need to train people closer to where we need them to work and understand much better the reasons for doctors choosing to go into certain specialties and not others. Careers will need to be more flexible so that doctors are able to do different things at different times.
These main presentations, all of which provided a great deal of food for thought, were interspersed by some really fascinating shorter sessions. Richard Stevens and Joseph Butler staged a witty and penetrating sketch on the impact of new communication technologies on doctor: patient communication within the consultation. Sunny Raju, Lily Lamb and colleagues’ debate on visionary leadership was a powerful reminder of the resources that the next generation of clinicians will bring to medicine in the future.
This important dialogue needs to continue, and this absorbing day suggested that it will do so with a spirit of optimism. Perhaps what came across most strongly was the enduring importance of the human dimensions of medical care, the need for personal contact, the desire for trust, the hope for continuity and the value placed on genuinely personal care. These are the values which, no matter how seductive the new technologies appear, must remain at the centre of the professional and moral compass of medicine.

Hearing crackles: reflections on PACES and prejudice
Posted by BJGP Life | 15 Apr 2016 | AiT, Opinion | 1
Rachel Brettell is an Academic Clinical Fellow GP Trainee in the Oxford Deanery.
As a GP registrar, the MRCGP Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA) exam is currently at the forefront of my mind. VTS teaching focuses on how to pass, evenings are spent revising, and my bank account, now £1700 lighter, still makes me shudder. And yet, perhaps naively, it was still a shock to me to find out that at no point in the CSA exam am I expected to accurately detect real clinical signs. Of course, the CSA assesses many other important skills, including problem solving skills, person-centred care and attitudinal aspects. My argument is certainly not with the inclusion of these. However, given that ‘the validity of the CSA resides in its realistic simulation of real-life consultations,’ it seems strange that it includes no real patients, and consequently no real physical signs, both somewhat important components, I would argue, of many real-life consultations.
By contrast, the clinical component of Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP), the PACES exam (Practical Assessment of Clinical examination skills), involves real patients with a given condition. Candidates undertake a respiratory, abdominal, cardiovascular and neurological exam, as well as a history station, communication and ethics station, and two brief clinical consultations. In these, candidates are given eight minutes with a patient to take a focused history, carry out a relevant examination, respond to the patient’s concerns, and explain a management plan. This PACES exam is robust, and considered a rite of passage for medical trainees, who often require multiple attempts to pass. To a GP trainee it often seems unattainably tough. When colleagues pass, we congratulate them, but we also breathe a sigh of relief that we don’t have to go through the same arduous process, and in doing so, we perhaps elevate our colleagues above ourselves.
I would argue this is wrong on many levels.
This veneration of MRCP gives the impression that our exit exams are ‘easier’, or that we couldn’t pass a more robust exam should we need to. As a GP trainee who decided to undertake my MRCP exam, I would argue this is far from the truth. When I first started revising for the exam, I was met with a mix of attitudes. Confusion from many other trainees (why on earth would I put myself through such an arduous process when I didn’t have to), despair from my husband (yet another set of costly exams and weekends revising), and downright derision from my programme directors, who actively discouraged me from taking the exam as it would be a ‘distraction’ from ‘becoming a good GP’. But having been through the process, I can argue sincerely that I have little doubt I am a much better GP as a result. Revision involved seeing and examining vast numbers of patients and I now have much greater confidence in my ability to detect signs and synthesise clinical findings appropriately, quickly, and under pressure.
The two brief clinical encounters are pretty much as close to a real life GP consultation as you can get, and preparing for this was directly relevant to my day to day practice in GP. The sophisticated communication skills training I have received as a GP trainee was invaluable for the history and communication stations. The feedback I regularly receive from my GP trainers was far more meaningful and insightful than that given at expensive revision courses run by eminent hospital consultants, and is something I truly value as a result. Attending revision courses and practicing with colleagues really made me appreciate the art of consulting that we spend much time and effort honing, particularly as I watched others tying themselves up in nots over ethical dilemmas and breaking bad news scenarios that would be bread and butter to a GP trainee.
But more than just the relevance of the exam and the associated learning, gaining my MRCP has taught me so much more. It was a hard, but an eminently passable exam. Whilst it is tempting to put medical colleagues who have passed on a pedestal, this is dangerous, and risks exacerbating the disconnect between primary and secondary care. As GPs we are more than capable of passing this exam. I spend my days seeing undifferentiated patients, who present with a symptom (or 7!) rather than a diagnosis. Hence, ‘examine this patient with shortness of breath’ didn’t frighten me. I rarely have the results of bloods, imaging or other diagnostic tests on hand to confirm a diagnosis. Hence, detecting and interpreting a patient’s heart murmur without the luxury of an echo wasn’t anything new. Seeing a wide variety of patients in quick succession under considerable time pressure is ‘just another day in the office’ to me.
Furthermore, the revision process made me realise that some of our medical colleagues have an almost laughable lack of understanding of what we do, and what we face, day in day out in primary care. Whilst revising with a hospital colleague, I completed a particularly gruelling viva on pulmonary fibrosis. He was impressed with my answers (helped by a recent respiratory job), but, when he found out I was a GP trainee, exclaimed ‘What a waste! Why does a GP need to know anything about pulmonary fibrosis? You just hear the crackles and refer.’ My jaw dropped with disbelief, and had it not been so sincere, it might have been funny. He couldn’t understand the fundamental role of the GP in managing even the most complex medical patients. Needless to say I took some pleasure in pointing this out to him, but whilst silently sobbing inside.
Who suspects the initial diagnoses, and filters it out from all the others? Who supports the patient and their family through the diagnostic pathway, the treatment, and the inevitable decline? Who is there for anything and everything between their 3 monthly respiratory clinic appointments? Who keeps them out of hospital wherever possible, but negotiates an admission when needed? Who coordinates the vast array of healthcare professionals involved in their care? Of course, their GP. Yes, we value communication skills and holistic care, but we also provide very real medical care too. With foundation exposure to general practice remaining disappointingly low, we really do have a duty to address these disappointingly common misconceptions about what GPs do and the challenges we face.
Finally, and more controversially, I was met in some cases with a prejudice that I, as a GP trainee, wouldn’t be up to the rigorous exam process in a way that my medical colleagues were. The sad truth, that most aren’t willing to acknowledge, is that some secondary care colleagues still presume that people become GPs because they can’t get in to anything else. Several I spoke to were shocked that I had turned down a core medical job to undertake GP training. Most underestimated just how passionately we believe in the crucial role that GPs play, the enormous difference we can make to patient care, and the excellence we can strive to achieve as true generalists. It surprised many that I could be bothered to learn for an exam that wasn’t compulsory – a far cry from the reality of my cohort of GP trainees who have voluntarily undertaken (and paid for) many extra qualifications to further their knowledge and expertise. It gave me some pleasure when these types saw me perform well on a particular station, but that pleasure was far outweighed by the disappointment that this arrogance and lack of respect can still persist within our profession.
However, I believe it is just as much our job to get out there and change these attitudes and to prove our worth, as it is for our hospital colleagues to start recognising and respecting our skills. We still work in a hierarchical system of long held beliefs and prejudices. Until MRCGP is looked on with the same reverence as MRCP, we have work to do. I refuse to be looked down on by colleagues and our exit exam, which seemingly places little emphasis on detecting clinical signs, may actually play into many prejudices about the profession, as a touchy feeling world where failed medics go to see out their days trying to persuade patients with viral URTIs they really don’t need antibiotics and managing mild depression.
So I would argue, perhaps only a little tongue in cheek, we all should be taking PACES. I think back to my revision course colleague and his belief that, as GPs, we ‘hear crackles and refer.’ Passing this exam means yes, I hear the crackles and have confidence in my ability to do so. But, perhaps most importantly of all, just one or two more of my hospital colleagues might also now recognise and value us GPs as the robust, efficient and highly skilled clinical workforce we are, who do so much more than ‘just hear crackles and refer…’

You have made some pertinent observations and I congratulate you on achieving MRCP(UK). I too work as a GP and hold MRCP(UK) and , having worked in GP land for over 10 years, I am of the opinion that it is the process of acquiring MRCP which engenders enduring good habits which, sadly, are not instilled to anywhere close to the same degree by MRCGP. Moreover, to pass MRCP(UK) one needs to have done an array of medical disciplines whereas I have encountered GPs with MRCGP whose general medical experience consists of their house job (?FY1) and a 6 month stint which comprised of 3 months Care of the Elderly and 3 months Rehab only.On a weekly basis I see patients whose results have been ignored or misinterpreted (such as labelling a patient as being in AF because the computer interpretation of a trace says so when clearly P waves are present); correspondence which ignores medication changes or other points of action; physical signs which are evaluated shoddily (eg patients labelled as having aortic stenosis because of a systolic sound at the aortic area-with no consideration to pulse character/apex beat/second heart sound/BP); inappropriate referrals because signs are misinterpreted; poor investigative pathways (eg the buck stops when an anaemic patient has normal haematinics)- the list goes on.
An analogy, if you will:a layman when inspecting a painting may comment on the colours whereas the devoted art critic will infer emotional content. When presented with a patient, the holder of MRCP will see, and extract, much more cogent information than that obtained by a superficial analysis of the information. I accept the GPs role is not to be the same as the hospital physician, but it is dis-spiriting to see such superficial medicine being practised daily; when pointed out to the purveyors of such practise they do actually (when pushed) have much of the knowledge but they lack the afore-mentioned approach which the MRCP so beautifully bestows.

Women in medicine: increasing in numbers but not regard
Posted by Emily Bailey | 8 Mar 2020 | Opinion
Throughout the last century we have witnessed major advancements for women in the UK, but gender inequalities continue to exist in the workplace. The NHS, established with the intent to treat everyone equally, is no exception. On average, female GPs — who now make up more than half of our workforce — continue to feel undervalued, hold less senior roles, and receive lower pay when compared to men.

Casting down the pseudo-religion of clinical examination
Posted by Des Spence | 10 Jun 2016 | Clinical, Opinion, Undergraduate | 1
The glass bounced off my back and smashed into the drinks gantry shattering a whisky bottle. All I remember is the glass, the blood and that terrible screaming. Glass fights are dangerous, especially as barman, and for $1.80 an hour I often wondered if it was worth it. But it had its compensations for it was the best practical module on communication skills I ever had and I have used my experiences everyday of my medical career. Teaching undergraduates for the last 10 years I have enjoyed regaling them with my ‘pub communication’ stories.
I am convinced of the value of teaching communication skills but what of the scared cow, clinical examination? I was taught by rote – rigid application of clinical skills – inspection, palpation, auscultation and percussion. I was humiliated for not hearing split heart sounds, ridiculed for missing bronchial breathing, scolded for not saying “ninety-ninety” instead of “one-one-one” and I was laughed at for missing a breech presentation.
My objection is not that many of my tutors had a charisma bypass nor their dissocial personality disorders, my issue is that most of what they taught me to be unquestionable ‘fact’ was in reality complete nonsense. I will go further, not only were most of the clinical signs utterly worthless but many are downright dangerous.
How many times have I heard creps at the lung bases and in good faith organized a chest x-ray only for this to be reported 16 weeks later as being normal? I wonder about the times clinical examination has falsely reassured me leading to a delay in diagnosis – to my shame I can think of a few. The real unquestionable fact is that clinical examination is neither sensitive nor specific and devoid of any quantifiable predictive value of disease. Let’s be honest, most of clinical examination is merely the pseudo-religious ceremony of medicine passed down from our distant pagan healer ancestors.
I am, however, forced to pass these dark arts onto the next generation of unsuspecting doctors (secretly I subvert the students but please don’t tell my university). Even the iconic stethoscope is in reality little more than a simple stage prop used by insecure junior doctors who lack the gravitas to convince patients that they are doctors.
It is time for the unbearable and unthinkable but we must cast down the false deity that is clinical examination. In the new dawn light we should take the few worthwhile glittering gems from clinical examination but ditch the rest. Instead, let us teach students about health seeking behaviour, dealing with uncertainty and how to rationally investigate and manage common presenting symptoms. This might end the modern tsunami approach to investigations whose huge yield of minor incidental findings then burst and flood out the NHS outpatients. This might actually help prevent the rampant health neurosis that we as a profession are thoughtlessly inflicting on our poor patients.
Please, put your tumblers down for one last moment as I have a final point of heresy. Ultrasound is cheap, quick and easy, so why don’t we teach students to use an ultrasound probe? This could be used in many different clinical situations but I guess it might be heavy to wear round the neck! All I remember is the glass, the blood and that terrible screaming.

Des, I wholeheartedly agree with your opinion that the use of ultrasound should be more widespread and, in the era of pocket echos, the days of using the stethoscope for listening to heart sounds may be numbered. But I have to say I disagree with your bleak assessment of the value of physical examination.
In my opinion, improving physical examination skills can only reduce the burden of investigation because it is when we are most uncertain that we cast off on the fishing expeditions of scatter gun investigations.
If nothing else the physical exam is a form of communication, it’s a way of demonstrating to the patient that you are taking them seriously and looking more deeply into their complaint. And, if you’re going to do it for that reason, you may as well be trained to make it of some diagnostic value as well.

Introducing GPs Anonymous
Posted by Peter Aird | 13 Jan 2015 | Opinion, Political, Random | 0
Peter Aird is a GP in Bridgwater, Somerset.
Is it just me or is being a GP increasingly being portrayed as something for which one ought to be ashamed? If so, then perhaps we should consider if we need some help.
With the latest suggestion that patients will be able to bypass their GP and refer themselves for cancer investigations, perhaps it’s time to face up to an uncomfortable truth. We’ve been told enough times by enough people – perhaps the implication is true: we’re not up to the job. It’s all the fault of we GPs.
We mustn’t
go on denying it any longer – convincing ourselves we’re OK – after all, until we acknowledge our problem how can we expect anything to be done to help us. We will just go on making everyone’s life a misery.
We all know how embarrassing GP behaviour can be – you know the kind of thing, spoiling everything for everybody on Christmas Day by turning up at a family gathering rather than opening our surgeries as normal – and thereby compelling people to waste hours in A&E departments with their sore throats and itchy toes. And then, of course, there is the wilful ignoring of our patients who clearly have cancer whilst, at the same time, putting an unnecessary burden on secondary care services by admitting patients to hospital just for the fun of it.
So let’s all face up to our problem. I’ll go first by introducing myself:
My name is Peter – and I’m a General Practitioner.
There that wasn’t so bad -to be honest it’s a relief to have it out in the open – I hope you can find it in your heart to accept someone as shameful as me – after all the hurt I’ve caused. If you’re similarly afflicted, come and join me – I’m setting up ‘GPs Anonymous’ in the hope that together we can support all of us who are stricken with the affliction that is ‘being a GP’.
But perhaps you’re still unconvinced you have a problem. Can I urge you then to ask yourselves these four screening questions? Answer two in the affirmative and you may have a problem – answer ‘Yes’ to all four and you’re in real trouble.
C – have you ever felt you wanted to cut down how much general practice you do?
A – have you ever been annoyed by criticism of your actions as a GP?
G – have you ever felt guilty for what you have done as a GP?
E – have you ever started early in the morning doing your ‘GP thing’?
Extra phone lines will be installed should demand for this new service prove overwhelming.
[bctt tweet=”BJGP Blog: Peter Aird is joining GPs Anonymous. Try the CAGE questionnaire.”]
So why do people fall into the destructive behaviour patterns of general practitioners? Well there seems to be a genetic component in some cases – seeing your parents behaving as GPs seems to predispose some to follow a similar path – though, thankfully this is becoming less common. Others experience a little bit of general practice early on in their medical career and naively imagine that it’s a good thing – something they can control. After all, just one attempt at a ten minute consultation can’t hurt can it? But before long they’re out of control – only in it for the extortionate pay, long hours of ‘off duty’ and the kicks one gets from the systematic mismanagement of those who thought they were there to help.
It’s a tragic condition but, with the arrival of ‘GPs Anonymous’ at last there is some real hope for change. Perhaps together we can rid the country of the blight that GP’s have become.
And then won’t everyone be happy?

Why Slazenger’s cat explains global warming
Posted by David Misselbrook | 19 Sep 2016 | Opinion, Random | 1
I admit that Slazenger’s cat is a red herring, but my wife was in a rail carriage a while ago, close to a small group of friends in earnest discussion. One was trying to refer to the paradox of Schrödinger’s cat, but couldn’t quite remember the name, so it came out as Slazenger’s cat, which has remained within our family folklore hereafter. But the cat that explains global warming is owned by a friend, a mathematician rather than a quantum physicist. They were faced with the perennial question – what to do with the cat when they go on holiday?
Our friend here in Bahrain flees home to Canada for the summer (well, Canada does not reach 48°C in August). Mr Tibbles never goes out of their flat. So a fairly routine problem of care you would think? They have an additional problem. Should one just leave the air conditioning on continuously for 6 weeks, risking it breaking down when they are not there, thus killing the cat through heat exhaustion? Their Arab helper (whom they employ to wash their cars) will care for the cat. He is competent, although illiterate. So they give the helper a key. At the helper’s request they lock all the internal doors except for the room with the cat. The helper turns on the air con every morning when the cat gets fed, and turns it off every night, when the outdoor temperature will go down to the low 30°C. All should be well.
Except of course it isn’t. The air con in the cat’s room breaks down just as they are leaving for the airport. Fine, put the cat in another room and let the helper know. But the helper has no phone (and is still illiterate). So my friend’s children rapidly draw diagrams and maps of the layout of the flat with large arrows on walls leading a path to the cat’s new abode, a room with functioning air con. And of course my friend spends the summer in the same state of suspended belief as Slazenger, Schrödinger, whoever.
But this rather shaggy tale explains why this part of the world is not going to cut back on its carbon emissions any time soon. I am sitting writing this with the air con on. It’s a few degrees cooler today, only 43°C. We turn the air con off when we are out, to give it a rest, but there’s no way we could live by day or sleep by night without it. But, hey, energy from oil powered power stations is so cheap out here. We don’t get an electricity bill – it’s not worth it, it’s just bundled up into the rent because it’s as cheap as chips. (Well, considerably cheaper than chips to be accurate.) And our lush green apartment gardens would be dry and dead in days without the unending power hungry efforts of the local desalination plant – well it rains four days a year and there are no rivers in Bahrain – where do you think the water comes from? Oh, and I haven’t mentioned our apartment’s two 500,000 litre swimming pools. Desalinating water for both of them would take about 28 car petrol tanks of fuel, enough to drive from the UK to New Zealand (although I wouldn’t advise trying it).
As I look out of my window over the blue waters of the Gulf and the squat square rooves of my neighbours I can see plenty of jet skis and high end cars but no solar panels. (I didn’t even know they made a five-litre Jaguar until I came out here.) So the Middle East won’t be giving up its reliance on fossil fuels any time soon. And what of the rest of the world? Despite what I have seen of refugee camps in this region and slums in African townships, poverty in most parts of the emerging world is reducing overall. And to what does the emerging world aspire? To a low impact organic recycled utopia, or to air con, MacDonalds and five litre Jaguars? I’ll leave you to guess.
I love a line our daughter wrote on her website: “when we throw something away, where do we think away is?” We make rather feeble attempts to live a low-impact life that is actually impossible as an ex-pat in the Middle East (and in any case is trumped by our air miles travelling home a few times a year.) And the west is still obsessed with “growth”. Actually the west is all grown up and just a bit too big. Should we not be obsessed with stabilizing our planet? It’s our way of life that needs to become more resilient, not our GPs. Grown-ups putting on weight is not healthy and it’s time we attended to our planet’s BMI.
By the way, the air con worked fine – Mr Tibbles lives.

This is really interesting – especially where you mention the reliance on air conditioning. The lack of water in your area also sounds concerning but hey, global warming right? Really interesting, thanks!

A BJGP Christmas Carol: Part Two
Posted by BJGP Life | 18 Dec 2018 | Stories | 0
Peter Aird is a GP in Bridgwater, Somerset.
This is part two of a five part series. If you can’t wait and like to binge read then you can download the full five part version for free as an epub or mobi file for use with your Kindle or other e-reader.
Stave Two – in which Scrooge fondly remembers
Dr Scrooge woke in a cold sweat and sat bolt upright in his bed. This was not unusual for, in recent weeks, the stress associated with an impending visit by the CQC had frequently disturbed his sleep. Moments later, however, his thoughts were diverted from the need to get on and write those mandatory protocols on the secure overnight storage of hand towels and the safe use of the stairs, when, at one o’clock precisely, his bedroom door creaked open and a strange looking fellow crept into the room. Over a woollen cardigan he wore a tweed jacket complete with leather patches on the elbows; on the end of his nose was perched a pair of pince nez glasses; and in his hand he carried a battered black Gladstone bag.
‘Are you the spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold me?’ asked Scrooge.
‘Indeed I am,’ the apparition replied, ‘I am the Ghost of General Practice Past. I’ve come straight from a meeting of my celestial Balint Group. And my, what catharsis we enjoyed there this evening. Your former partner, Jacob, was in attendance. He’s a good chap, a jolly fine fellow. But enough of that. Come along with me – he has sent me to show you what General Practice once was.’
The spirit held out his hand and Scrooge instinctively took it. As he did so, Scrooge felt himself being lifted, as if weightless, from his bed. The spirit led him to, and then through, the wall of the bedroom and out into the night air. They journeyed until they found themselves in the oak-panelled surroundings of what appeared to be a gentleman’s club. A number of elderly men sat together in high-backed leather chairs. All were doctors, enjoying a glass of port after a drug sponsored Christmas meal. With them was a medical student who was attached to one of their number.
‘Listen to these chaps,’ the spirit said to Ebenezer, ‘Each and every one is a fine fellow – a jolly good chap. You could learn a thing or two from what decent sorts like these have to say.’
The men were taking it in turns in regaling the medical student with tales of their working life.
‘Of course, these days, the youngsters have it easy. They only work a mere seventy-two hours a week you know. In my day it was eighty-one’
‘Eighty-one hours? You had it easy. It was all internal cover when I did my house jobs. In real terms, I did a hundred hours a week.’
‘Only a hundred hours a week? Luxury. I was running a GP practice single handedly by the time I was 23… On call every hour of every day.’
‘That’s right. We had it tough as GPs. One hundred and sixty-eight hours a week we worked – and, of course, we had to provide all the obstetric care – home deliveries every day.’
‘And most of those were c-sections – we had do the operations with only kitchen utensils for surgical instruments and a bottle of brandy for an anaesthetic.’
‘Aye – and if you tell that to the medical students of today, they’ll not believe you.’
The spirit indicated that it was time to move on and Ebenezer readily agreed. He’d heard it all before. The walls of the room blurred and faded and gradually, as things came back into focus, Scrooge realised that they were now high above rolling hills. Passing over snow-covered fields and lanes, they travelled until they came at last to a small town and stopped by a house that Scrooge recognised as his childhood home. Outside the dwelling, a car pulled up. The familiar figure of his family GP clambered out of the vehicle and made her way up the garden path to the front door. A woman was waiting anxiously for her arrival. They exchanged a warm greeting after which the woman led the doctor up the stairs to a room in which a boy lay, pale and in obvious distress.
‘Thank you for coming doctor, I know you’re busy but I didn’t know what to do. Ebenezer’s usually such a healthy child but he seems now to be struggling with his breathing.’
‘It’s no trouble Mrs Scrooge – let’s take a look at him.’
The doctor knelt down by the bedside and smiled at the boy who managed to smile back. Ebenezer liked the doctor. He’d visited her a number of times over the years but this was the first time she’d ever visited him. The doctor asked a few questions and then carefully examined the boy, paying particularly careful attention to his chest. When she was done, she turned back to his mother and gave her the diagnosis.
‘I’m afraid it looks like we’ve a case of pneumonia on our hands. He’s really quite poorly and will be needing the help of my colleagues at the hospital. We best get him there as soon as possible.’
Scrooge looked on and wondered how she could say such a thing without a computer and a pulse oximeter to enable her to assess the risk of sepsis. She hadn’t appeared to even consider a CURB-65 score. None the less, a few phone calls were made and the doctor, placing her hand on Mrs Scrooge’s shoulder as if to say that everything would be alright, made her goodbyes, having given an assurance that an ambulance would soon arrive, an expectation Scrooge thought fanciful in the extreme.
‘Do you remember that day Ebenezer?’ asked the Ghost of General Practice Past.
‘I do,’ Ebenezer whispered, taken aback at how emotional he was now feeling. The spirit smiled to himself as he sensed that Scrooge was close to tears. He loved catharsis – catharsis was good.
‘She was such a lovely doctor’, Scrooge continued. ‘Always so kind and reassuring. She’d become almost a part of the family having visited so frequently during the last days of my father’s final illness. She always seemed to have time. It was because of her that I decided to become a doctor. The way she practised medicine caused me to realised that being a doctor was a wonderful job to have. She seemed to me to be a fortunate woman.’
‘A fortunate woman indeed,’ agreed the spirit. ‘A fortunate women and…’ he paused, thrown for a moment, ‘…a good chap.’ The spirit hesitated again and then added, as if to try and reassure himself, ‘She was a jolly fine fellow.’
With that the ghost again took Scrooge’s hand and soon they were once more travelling through the night sky. On and on they flew, until they came to a village hall decorated brightly with all manner of coloured lights. A Christmas tree strewn with tinsel and still more lights stood by the entrance. Inside, Scrooge recognised the staff of his GP training practice. Some talked, others laughed and a number danced enthusiastically to music provided by a band. All were clearly enjoying the opportunity to relax and have fun together. A portly man then stood up and called for a bit of hush. It was Dr Fezziwig, the senior partner of the practice and Ebenezer’s one time trainer.
‘A moment’s silence if you please everybody. If I might say a few words, thank you all so much for coming this evening. I hope you’re having a good time.’ He paused a moment and then, with a feigned suggestion of doubt in his voice, questioned the crowd, ‘You are having a good time, aren’t you?’
Those gathered gave the desired response with cheers and roars that left nobody in any doubt that indeed they were. Fezziwig continued. ‘I want to thank you all for your help this past year. The partners appreciate your hard work, doing what can be a very difficult job. We couldn’t manage without you.’ More cheers followed together with a few calls for a pay rise. Fezziwig then concluded by wishing everyone a very Merry Christmas and insisting that everyone took advantage of the free bar that he and the partners were glad to provide. ‘Only keep an eye on young Dr Scrooge. He’s a fine young doctor but Ebenezer’s not as experienced as we older GPs and I’m not sure he can take his drink! We don’t want a repeat of last month’s incident when he woke up naked on the delicatessen counter at Sainsbury’s!’
‘Now he does seem like a good chap – a jolly fine fellow,’ declared the spirit, beaming as if the natural order had been restored to where chaos had once threatened to reign. ‘He’s a good, fine, decent, jolly chap of a fellowy sort if ever I saw one.’
The Ghost of General Practice Past turned to Scrooge and looked him straight in the eye. ‘But what of him?’ the spirit asked drawing his companion’s attention to a young man who was accepting the gentle ribbing at the hands of the senior colleague he respected so highly. He was sat laughing alongside various members of staff with whom he was sharing a table.
‘I was so happy then,’ Scrooge told the ghost. ‘He was such a wise man and so willing to share what he had learnt. And we were such a great team, all so eager to support one another. Back then, there seemed to be so much more time. Why did everything change? And how did I become so resentful of the job I used to love?’
‘Something certainly changed – something that shouldn’t have,’ replied the ghost. ‘At least, not in the way it has. Perhaps something needs to change again. Perhaps something needs to be recovered. But it is for you to decide what and how. As for me, my time is up. We must return. You have other guests to welcome tonight.’
And in less time than it takes for EMIS to crash on a busy Monday morning, Scrooge was back in his room, alone with his thoughts. It was nearly two in the morning.

Paramedics in general practice: what can we expect?
Posted by BJGP Life | 23 Feb 2018 | Bright Ideas and Innovation, Clinical | 0
Kamal R. Mahtani, Georgette Eaton, Matthew Catterall and Alice Ridley highlight the potential roles for paramedics in general practice.
The NHS enters its 70th year with the general practice workforce in crisis. The promise of 5000
more GPs is a distant pipedream and as clinical demand increases, the number of full-time equivalent GPs continues to fall. New strategies are desperately needed to tackle these problems. The NHS England GP Forward View advocates investing and developing new models of care. This includes expansion of a multidisciplinary and more integrated primary care team. These recommendations reflect the findings of the Primary Care Workforce Commission, who highlighted potential roles for paramedics, clinical pharmacists, and physician associates, all substituting into current GP care pathways.
The generalist skill mix of the modern day paramedic graduate creates possibilities for them to work in a range of domains.
Paramedics already have a track record in providing flexible and innovative ways of delivering extended clinical care. This is partly because of the expectation that a UK paramedic can give generalist care as an autonomous allied healthcare professional. The College of Paramedics, which acts as the professional body, defines the expected competencies from a paramedic graduate as
“an autonomous practitioner who has the knowledge, skills and clinical expertise to assess, treat, diagnose, supply and administer medicines, manage, discharge and refer patients in a range of urgent, emergency, critical or out of hospital settings”. Although some graduates go on to develop further skills, taking on Specialist, Advanced, and Consultant Paramedic roles, the generalist skill mix of the modern day paramedic graduate creates possibilities for them to work in a range of domains.
So what might general practice expect? Early review pointed to deployment of paramedics into roles that included centralised telephone triage, on-scene acute care delivery, and intermediate community care support schemes. However, there is now growing recognition that the generalist skills of the paramedic could be deployed into more widespread in-hours general practices. This may include running clinics, triaging and managing minor illnesses, and providing continuity for patients with complex health needs. Further roles may include assessment and management of requests for same-day urgent home visits, as well as regular visits to homebound patients with long-term conditions.
Specialist paramedics provided home visit support and dispensed some acute medications to community-based patients.
Such innovation requires careful evaluation. The NHS England GP Access Fund (formerly the Prime Minister’s Challenge Fund) served as a platform to test, and to some degree, evaluate how paramedics can be deployed in primary care. The first evaluation report highlighted at least four sites, among the 20 awarded funding, which piloted a range of models in primary care, working with the ambulance service and paramedics. On the South Kent Coast, specialist paramedics provided home visit support and dispensed some acute medications to community-based patients. The service reportedly saved 720 GP appointments, although details are limited. In Workington, Specialist Paramedics were deployed into A&E departments to determine whether patients could have been more appropriately treated in a Primary Care Centre.
The NHS GP Forward View and the Primary Care Workforce Commision have both recommended an increase in the number of GPs as well as the development of a multidisciplinary primary workforce. Although advocated, broader deployment of paramedics in general practices still requires careful evaluation of clinical outcomes, value, and satisfaction. Consideration should also be given to the growth of paramedics’ roles in this setting and their potential impact on ambulance services. Nevertheless, although absolute numbers remain small, between September 2016 and March 2017 the number of paramedics working in general practice has grown, increasing from 75 to 150. The NHS has also had a positive public response to proposals to introduce independent prescribing by paramedics. This may facilitate more clinical roles in general practice, a setting that is desperate for extra capacity, and integrated multidisciplinary teams of the future.

Research priorities in primary care: ideas from the coal-face

Setting research priorities in primary care: a co-creation symposium to generate ideas from the coal-face
Written by Victoria Tzortziou Brown, Clare Wilkinson, Kamal Mahtani, Geoff Wong, Azeem Majeed, Philip Evans, Thomas Round, and Roger Jones
Background
Although over 90% of patient contacts within the NHS occur in primary care, many of the interventions used in this setting frequently lack a sound, up-to-date, scientific basis.1Primary care research: The MRC’s proposals. G., Radda. 426: 872 British Journal of General Practice , 1998, Vol. 48. The applicability of research findings and relevant guidelines to front-line primary care practice is increasingly being questioned.2A review of clinical practice guidelines found that they were often based on evidence of uncertain relevance to primary care patients. N Steel et al. 11:1251-1257 Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, 2014, Vol. 67. Additionally, there seems to be a mismatch between what patients and clinicians want to see researched and the research that is actually being carried out.3Patients’, clinicians’ and the research communities’ priorities for treatment research: there is an important mismatch. Crowe S, Fenton M, Hall M, Cowan K, Chalmers I. Research Involvement and Engagement, 2015, Vol. 1.
There is an increasing recognition that research questions should be generated with input from front-line clinicians and patients and a shift is needed from a unidirectional connection between research and practice to a bi-directional one.4Evidence Generating Medicine: Redefining the Research-Practice Relationship to Complete the Evidence Cycle. Embi PJ, Payne P. S87-S91, Medical Care, 2013, Vol. 51.
The Intervention
The purpose of the Symposium was to bring together front-line primary care professionals (including GPs, Practice Managers, Nurses and Allied Healthcare Professionals) as well as NHS commissioners and Academics to generate ideas for primary care research.
The idea was discussed with colleagues from the NIHR HTA Primary Care Panel and the RCGP Clinical Innovation and Research Centre (CIRC) teams and a novel approach was developed that had the potential to facilitate the identification of evidence gaps.
The first stage of the intervention included an online survey which invited participants to reflect on their every-day practice and submit their research ideas online.
The second phase was the Symposium itself which took place at the Royal College of GPs. This incorporated an interactive session which covered the importance of bridging the gap between evidence and practice, the process from research idea to research commissioning and the basic steps of formulating research questions. The interactive session was then followed by facilitated round-table discussion using a semi-structured approach during which delegates went through a process of developing and prioritising research questions.
Significance and potential of the symposium
The Symposium provided a unique opportunity for primary care researchers, front-line professionals and commissioners to identify gaps in current evidence base and formulate key themes for primary care research.
The survey generated 44 research ideas. Respondents included GPs, nurses, physiotherapists, data analysts, commissioners and administrators at GP practices.
The Symposium was attended by 50 frontline healthcare professionals across a wide range of disciplines. It generated 15 additional research questions with themes around end of life, technology, mental health and staff wellbeing. These were prioritised by delegates.
The themes identified have been shared with relevant stakeholders and will be considered by the NIHR HTA Primary Care Panel during their research theme identification process.
We are working with relevant stakeholders so that the Symposium can become an annual event which will offer an opportunity for frontline professionals to shape the type of research commissioned for policy and applied healthcare provision and will assist towards bridging the gap between research, commissioning and clinical practice.
Acknowledgements
The Symposium was funded by NIHR and organised by QMUL, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry in collaboration with members of the NIHR HTA Primary Care panel and the RCGP Clinical Innovation and Research Centre (CIRC) teams.

BJGP Long Read: A valedictory note on my retirement
Posted by BJGP Life | 21 Feb 2020 | BJGP Long Read | 18
Claire Stillman is a recently retired GP who spent 30 years in Scottish general practice, the last 20 of which were in Glasgow.
About eight months ago I wrote an emotional, angry rant about why I was leaving general practice. It was in response to a questionnaire from the LMC asking me for reasons why I was going. I never sent it to them; it seemed enough to write everything down and it exhausted my anger. I kept meaning to go back to it but I never did, probably because it was too upsetting when I was in work and then it became irrelevant when I left. My emotion had been expended. Also, I felt that I had said nothing new. There were no blinding insights, other people had said the same things over and over and nothing had changed. It is hard to see how anything can change given the current structure and funding of the NHS. I should say that I took early retirement at the age of 59 following 30 years in General Practice and I might have taken a handful of days of sick leave in that time. I never took any time off for stress.
Here are the reasons I left, or perhaps some of them:
Appointments
The appointment system is not fit for purpose. A GP has to be all things to all people in 10 minutes only and this is untenable. In this time we have to deal with the polypharmacised multiply morbid patient who has several problems to discuss. We have to manage an increasing amount of clinical work transferred from secondary to primary care. We have to deal with the manipulative, the dangerous and the deluded. We have to deal with those with shopping lists of demands, the worried well, those sent by third parties for proof of just about anything. We have to deal with the longwinded, the demented, the unhappy, the angry. We have to deal with the worried parent and the sick child. We have to deal with the medical emergency or those who think it is an emergency. The list goes on. We are accessible to everyone, every single being has the right to walk in to discuss anything; there is no filter, no prior discussion to see whether a trip to a GP is appropriate or suitable.
We pay an emotional price for constant availability for everything the world throws at us.
GPs can be bullied and manipulated by a public who increasingly demand certainty and rights and a bureaucracy that seeks to medicalise social problems. In all this we have no support. We were trained to help others’ suffering, not manage our own. We pay an emotional price for constant availability for everything the world throws at us (and I mean everything), and a professionalism that is never acknowledged or meaningfully supported. We face the relentless expectations of the ten minute appointment, the constantly full waiting rooms, the unacceptable waiting times to be seen and feel constantly punished because we cannot meet them. I can honestly say that in all my time as a GP principle, I can count on one hand the times I did not have a fully booked surgery. Government policy, patient expectation, pressure on our staff mean that we are constantly in the wrong, on the back foot, for not delivering a service that, quite frankly, is impossible to provide. We are supposed to be made of teflon, have no feelings, cope with the relentless daily, monthly, yearly pressure of not delivering the impossibly perfect service that this society believes is their right.
Patient expectations
Expectations by patients have changed over my thirty years in practice. Society has changed; the consumer approach, the belief that everything should have an answer, the inability to accept the uncertainty of life and health; the belief that if something goes wrong someone must be to blame have all increased over time. Expectations increasingly fuelled by the unrealistic claims made on the internet. Also the idea that everyone should have instant access, instant answers, has grown. These expectations are not really compatible with what GPs do, namely manage uncertainty. Because of this GPs have been harried into increasing amounts of patient tests, often with no clear goal in mind and no evidence that it would be useful. On the contrary, tests breed insecurity and more tests, because doctors feel the need to cover themselves, to insure themselves against patients demanding ever more certainty. It is ironic that in an age when the population has never been more healthy or long lived, health uncertainty and anxiety increases. Adding to patient expectations is the medicalisation of human sadness. The belief that a doctor can make grief, sadness, the ordinary difficulties of life better with a pill or therapy seems to have increased steadily over the years.
Lack of resources
Mental health services were reason enough to leave general practice.
GPs are damned if they do and damned if they don’t. We are placed in impossible double binds by chronic NHS underfunding and then blamed for the outcomes. Classic examples are the exploitation of our gate keeping roles by saying we must refer less into secondary care and then blaming us for not diagnosing enough cancers. We are held responsible for not diagnosing the rarest of cancers, which have no characteristic sets of symptoms, and yet demonised or refused by secondary care if we refer patients like these in.
Mental health services were reason enough to leave general practice. The NHS in my area refused to fund or possibly organise an even half functioning service and given society’s propensity for medicalising any adverse human experience we were imprisoned in the ultimate double bind and for us it was a life sentence. Throughout my entire career I was supposed to deal with the mentally distressed in ten minute appointments with no credible back up. The media slammed us for handing out too many antidepressants giving the impression that we had any alternatives. Trust me, we did not. The stark choices for GPs dealing with mental distress ranging from overt psychosis to a little sadness were a prescription for a pill then and there and a bit more than ten minutes (thereby pressurising everyone else in the waiting room), or a referral for a mental health treatment, be it talking therapy or more assessment which might occur within the next 3 to 6 months. The icing on the cake was that despite a GP referral, the mental health service might decide, several weeks later, not to offer any treatment at all. Truly GPs backs are up against the wall when dealing with mental health problems, which on a conservative estimate, take up to 20% of their work. Indeed, there is a psychological component to all disease. Dealing with mental health services throughout my career was the most excruciating and depressing aspect of my job.
Another problem caused by underfunding, which inexorably worsened throughout my time in practice, was waiting times. This has caused the NHS to become cruel in its dealing with suffering patients. I have seen people with severe, debilitating, painful conditions having to wait up to a year to be seen in secondary care. And then they get sent for tests, have to wait months for their results, and then they have to wait further months for follow up in clinics to get the results of said tests. Hospital doctors never make decisions without panels of tests that seem to grow larger by the year. Meanwhile the GP is the only doctor a patient can directly access while waiting for all these events, the walls are very high around secondary care, and we are expected to manage their pain, anxiety and frustration with no power to change anything. As usual, there is no support for the GP managing the patient in this vacuum and the more compassionate the GP, the more likely they are to be broken by this powerlessness in the face of suffering.
Complexity
Patients are becoming increasingly complex. They live longer, are on more medication and often have two, three or even more co-existing conditions. We are expected to deal with their needs in ten minutes, or consider their problems in the little time we have between fire-fighting paperwork and results and managing the practice. Meanwhile secondary care is becoming more specialised with increasing numbers of silos. A patient goes to a hospital clinic where a specialist has the luxury of dealing with one condition only, with all the back up of a hospital department. And it can happen that the decision a specialist makes about the one condition that is their remit will have a knock on effect for the other conditions a patient might have. It is left to the GP to sort it out. A record achieved by one of my patients was that he visited seven different specialties on a regular basis, all of which dealt with one aspect of his care and none of which could come up with an overarching explanation for his symptoms. Needless to say I had ten minutes to deal with all of them. The use of protocols, guidelines and non-doctor vetting of secondary care referrals also lead to GP stress, not to say cruelty to the patient. The silos are getting narrower, secondary care clinicians are more and more empowered to say what they will not deal with . Meanwhile GPs have to deal with their rejections with no support for their suffering patients.
Polypharmacy
This is a real problem in the ten minute appointment. All evidence based medicine derives from studies on single conditions and all medication guidelines come from them. The problem is that very few patients have only one condition. The GP has to juggle co-prescribed medications with their multiplicity of interactions and side effects in each individual, very difficult in a busy surgery with a waiting room full of patients expecting to be seen on time. Ironically when the community pharmacists started to be involved in the Scottish NHS new contract, they stated they would need thirty minutes per patient. And a pharmacist would only be dealing with medications while the GP has to deal with the actual patient’s agenda, which may be something else entirely. Prescribing outwith the consultation has also become more onerous over the last few years as drug shortages and the increasing prescribing demands of secondary care have to be managed.
Poorly understood conditions/somatisation/chronic pain
Some of the hardest patients to deal with, the most time consuming and emotionally draining, are the ones that don’t fit into neat diagnostic boxes, yet constantly present with suffering and demand answers. These patients are not recognised by, and certainly not treated by secondary care. For example, those people with chronic pain for which we actually have no effective medication. Synthetic opiates, the only treatment out there, do not work and turn them into addicts. Any attempts at psychological reframing of their conditions are seriously resisted by the patients, and to be frank, the medical establishment.
There seems to be a belief that GP is elastic can continuously absorb extra work indefinitely.
The Cartesian dualism that bedevils our concepts of illness means that patients and many doctors think that the ultimate insult is to suggest that their suffering is ‘all in their head’ and for some strange reason does not then exist. Unfortunately GPs are faced with a number of patients who manifest their life distress with physical symptoms, call it somatisation for want of a better term, for whom existing medicine has no treatment and who become bitterly entrenched in their illness behaviour as they feel less and less cared for. The ‘fibromyalgics’, the chronically fatigued, for whom there is no realistic therapy and for which GPs have no training or support. I am not surprised that so many of them turn to snake oil salesman and quacks who at least provide them with attention before exploiting their vulnerabilities.
Outsourcing of secondary care work
Over the years, general practice has been subjected to a form of ‘mission creep’ with secondary care demanding that we increasingly do work that was originally done in hospital medicine. While it may seem reasonable that GPs manage new atrial fibrillation or perform near patient testing, this is added to our already increasing workload. There seems to be a belief that GP is elastic can continuously absorb extra work indefinitely. There is only so much work that we can take before we break.
Housebound patients
While home visit rates have gone down, housebound patients are becoming increasingly complex so that visits can resemble ward rounds in a geriatric hospital. Patients are often on medications and have conditions that need frequent monitoring and repeat visits that we are not resourced to manage. Latterly, I became increasingly concerned about our cohort of usually elderly, frail housebound patients on complex, potentially dangerous treatment regimes who were poorly managed in the community. General practice as it stands is just not equipped to deal with these people.
Conclusion
I think the chief thing to emphasise is that GPs stand alone, and are chronically under resourced. We may work in group practices and have our administration staff, but once the door is closed, it is just the GP and the patient in the room together. And in real time we have no support, indeed we have no formal support networks at all on the ground. There is no-one to catch us as we fall, we have no protection from the ire of the public, anger that is usually caused by a system that fails to deliver what has been promised. We stand and fall by the decisions we make in ten minutes and if things go wrong, the full weight of public and professional opprobrium lands on our heads. There is no safety net, no cavalry coming over the hill to relieve us.
Now, I have retired and I do not miss any of it. I was well thought of by my patients and staff to judge by the feedback I have received over the years and the overwhelming number of cards and presents I received when I retired. I also got on with and liked my partners. Yet a powerful emotion I associate with my time in general practice was one of failure. I had failed to deliver a good service and so now I am just relieved to be free of it. However, what does bother me is that I had a wealth of knowledge and skills, accumulated over lifetime, which I will never use again.
Yet there is no place for me now in my profession, general practice has lost my skills and those of all my retired peers completely.
And what does strike me is that perhaps my profession could benefit from my and my peers’ experience. I could perhaps mentor younger GPs, newly practising partners, and provide them with the support I never had. I can read a face, interpret its subtle movements, be aware of another’s suffering. I can listen actively and frame peoples’ stories empathetically and positively. I can pull out the essential points in a narrative, summarise a conversation, help someone form a plan for the future. I can listen. Yet there is no place for me now in my profession, general practice has lost my skills and those of all my retired peers completely. I feel that this is a shame as we are a resource that could be utilised for the good of the profession.
As for the future of general practice, I do not trust the Scottish NHS and the health boards to deliver the supposed new Scottish GP contract. They mouth platitudes but follow their own agendas rather than those of general practice, they have not trusted GPs to execute the changes and allocated funds seem to have dissipated in a plethora of talking shops and committees. It seems that the further you remove practitioners, the people who actually do the work, from decisions about how the work is done, the less successful the outcome. Unfortunately, GPs have been so busy actually doing their jobs, they have not had the time or emotional energy to fight for a new contract that works for them. I have little hope that the new contract will result in better experiences for patients or their doctors.
However, it can be argued that innovation, out of the box thinking comes from those without an interest in the system, so let’s throw the problem of how to run an NHS out there. Let all and sundry chew on it, because I don’t expect those within the system to come up with any answers. Lets hope someone has thought of something before the inevitable happens to me and I become a patient.

Thank you so very much for putting my sentiments down in such an eloquent way. I left my partnership in Glasgow recently aged 55 for the reasons you have outilined. I waited for the new contract and knew it was inadequate and resigned my partnership.
“the more compassionate the GP, the more likely they are to be broken by this powerlessness in the face of suffering”- this especially very much summed up my experience.
I now locum and feel more protected and distanced from the toxic work conditions expected of me by myself, patients, the NHS and the SG. I feel my experience of 30years as a doctor is wasted and I just have to suck it up and not dwell on it. That’s life! A shame when there is so much capacity of compassion and skill to give to people, given the right conditions.

Hi, given the current situation, perhaps we should view Active GP as something that you do for a finite time only, as part of a “portfolio career “ not a whole working lifetime. Rather you spend sometime at the frontline, then move onto less stressful jobs having done your bit. The question would be what to move on to that we have the skills and training for, apart from locum work. Also I think most people would agree that the more experienced the doctor the better practitioner they are. Always remembering that experience can just mean making the same mistakes with increasing confidence!

I also took early retirement from GP Partnership at 56 and have not regretted it. As I walked out of my surgery for the last time I almost literally felt a weight lifted from my shoulders. I share the author’s regret that I can’t continue to use the wisdom and experience gained over 30 years to help patients and relieve some of the burden from my younger colleagues.

Wow. Thank you for a brilliant, honest piece. I’m relatively early in my GP career and I recognise ALL of what you say. At the moment, the good outweighs the bad for me in GP, but I do wonder if I have the resilience to stay the distance. The lesson for me is: look after yourself and each other, because everyone else will milk you as dry as you let them.
I have saved this article for future reference and sharing. Thank you again.

I also took early retirement at 59 now nearly 7 years ago. This article describes my feelings too (OK in England not Scotland). I feel too that stopping work lifted a burden from me and regret at never being able to do the job to the best of my ability due to constant time pressure. The skills I gained in listening to my patients for over 30 years are no longer available to the NHS, as new less experienced doctors are assumed to be of equal value to the NHS. Bums on seats can be counted and that’s what appears to matter to those counting and making the rules.

Thanks for all your comments. Perhaps the RCGP should consider the mentoring idea! I refer to the comment I made above about limited stints at the front line. Sadly, in Scotland there is a shortage of new GPS and practices have had to shut up shop because of this. Clare

Clair, your comments eloquently outline the challenges and unreasonable demands placed on GP’s and 5 years ago I faced the same dilemma in my English practice of 30 years, and at 58 I too decided it was time to leave. I then decided to tackle a different challenge and moved to a much smaller remote and rural practice in the Hebrides as an NHS salaried partner. Surgeries and lists became smaller and I now have the luxury of time to spend with the patients and have the support of fabulous community staff. The experience and knowledge I’ve accumulated has been well used and I’ve truly enjoyed this final phase of my medical career, and I’m still working here
5 years later!
We are privileged to have the job we do, but time pressures can certainly prevent us giving our patients the service they deserve.

What a brilliantly written article. Comprehensively details why GP is failing and will likely not exist, at least in its current format, in the next 10-15 years. GP is the Walmart of medicine, pile them in, stack them high – all you can fit, anything and everything in a 10min appt. It is popular with politicians as they need cheap medicine by GPs to subsidise the expensive specialists and keep the tax payers happy with lower tax rates.
Unfortunately the real world is not like the Dr Who Tardis and time does not expand. GPs are human and to remain humane, we need to self care to avoid burnout. For some it will be time to boundary patients, for others it will be time to cut back on sessions and and for many it is time to look for alternative careers. I used to look at GPs as a child in the 1980s with deep respect and awe, they had status and commanded respect from their peers. These times no longer exist. Now each day is a battle for many if not most. I left the NHS year ago and will not return, I wish those of you who remain the best.

This has been one of the best short reads describing what GP life has become and I can’t disagree with any of it. Strange thing is, like the Gp reply above, who moved to a small rural practice , and enjoying his last 5 years, I too have honestly rarely ever had a bad day in my 30 years as a GP partner now aged 58 Wales. Small personalised list 2750 (weighted list 3500) in a 2 person (1.5fte) so 4 day week. The single biggest reason I remain happy and peaceful in the midst of the plethora of issues you so eloquently describe is for me they all become so much milder/manageable/solvable when there is someone who armed with a life time knowledge of their small 1300-1500 patients characters, expectations and illnesses, finds decisions and tests ,mail and the whole lot becomes quicker easier, more thorough.Its not that I am not busy ,it’s just not always busy. It’s not that I am better as I am not.
From what I see and hear in the profession generally, I can’t see a sustainable way forward for Primary care unless we rapidly move to personalised lists, yes in group partnerships supported by HCSW/Nurses/PA/admin . I mean where you are solely responsible for your own patients, not someone else’s,not strangers,not patients who try and manipulate new GPs. Yes seek 2nd opinions occasionally, Expect yes a day off each week where similar partner /colleagues cover any emergencies.No long waits to be seen . Telephone first less necessary, “Rubbish“ I hear some think,but I maintain it is all very possible because my experience is the time saving and in depth supervision by one GP of an almost totally “known” population really does yield the time and space to let us cope,grow and even thrive.
Most complex illnesses become less stressful as you have been with them through it all and know them almost as well as they do. Your previous consultation laid out the actions you would do if they returned. Ten minutes often plenty bar the first new complex illness, no more long history taking by talented GPs who have little knowledge of the patient multiplied a thousand times a year .Less mental stress and clinician anxiety.
Add in HCSW, social Prescribing and decent mental health services and it become a real pleasure and something even at 58 I don’t wish to give up.
Planning 2 days a week till 65.
You asked for a solution. There it is. Not meant to be Patronising. Personalised lists where you and only you ,95% of the time have to make the decisions that will affect your workplace tomorrow and next week Is the way ahead. .Claire, please don’t stay away, seek a small practice as you are incredibly valuable. As for me I am planning 2 days a week till 65.

I am a 50 year old GP working in North West England. I could not agree more with everything that is written in this article. I am a very robust individual and continue to work as a Partner in a large practice with great colleagues. However I have seen many very good people “broken” (alcoholism, Depression, burn out) by the toxic environment of General Practice.Good UK GPs are some of the finest and hard working General Physicians in the world. In the last 10 years I have come to the conclusion that the NHS is not fit for purpose in the current world and never will be. The sooner the NHS becomes a private insurance based service then the sooner GPs will be able to control their workload / quality of care and lead a full rewarding working life that does not “break them”.

Clair, what a beautifully written article.
Thank you.
Last year I initiated the project “Rediscover the Joy of General Practice” https://www.srmc.scot.nhs.uk/joy-project/
It is specifically designed for GPs like you coming up for retirement but who feel they have more to give, but not under the pressures you describe.
It began as a collaboration between NHS Orkney, Shetland, Western Isles and Highland and this year has expanded to include other Scottish Health Boards.
It is based on work undertaken in Orkney over the last 10 years.
We offer contracts of between 6-18+ weeks/year to undertake practice attachments for periods of 1-4 weeks at a time. Travel from a Scottish city and accommodation is paid for, meaning that GPs do not need to relocate.
Our philosophy is based on supporting the practices and staff in all aspects of GP work and quality improvement.
Have a look at the website to understand the scheme more fully.
In 2019 we recruited 33 GPs to our Rural GP Support Team, many were retiring GPs who have felt reinvigorated by working with us.
This year we have expanded the scheme to involve the whole of Scotland and not just rural practices.
Currently we have shortlisted a further 35 GPs.
Although we have officially closed, we will still accept late applications and will reopen to applications again once we have established this second team.
What is interesting is that as our team expands and develops we suddenly find that we have the opportunity to consider how we can tackle what previously seemed intractable problems.
All members of the team are encouraged to contribute their ideas of how we could tackle thorny issues and due to the phenomenal depth of experience and expertise among our GPs we find ourselves in an unusually empowered position.
The project is led by the Primary Care Associate Medical Directors and Managers from the participating Health Boards and has the full backing of the Scottish Government.
We are at an early stage and certainly do not have all the answers, but we are determined to try and make a difference.
Working together with vision, determination and lateral thinking I believe we can make real changes – however, I am a self-confessed irresponsible optimist!
Anyone interested, do have a look at the website and please feel free to join us.
Claire, I would very much like to have a chat with you and to explore some of your ideas.

GP in crisis: how does European family medicine compare?
Posted by BJGP Life | 27 Oct 2015 | Clinical, International, Opinion, Political | 7
Mary McCarthy is a GP in Shrewsbury., She is on the GPC and is interested in comparative health systems. She is the BMA rep to UEMO.
UEMO (Union Européenne des Médecins Omnipraticiens) represents GPs in 26 European member states. It develops policy and projects to support family medicine and to share best practice. It also provides an opportunity to look at other health systems and to learn from them, studying alternative ways of working and investigating ideas that may help with UK general practice.
Earlier this year, a questionnaire was circulated by the UK delegation that asked about workload pressures in the differing EU member states. A total of 25 states replied (Malta gave two answers for their public and their private health care systems) and although the data set is incomplete, it still makes interesting reading and an overview of the findings is presented here.
Different models, different responsibilities
Not all countries have registered lists of patients. Often it divides, as it does in the Irish Republic, into those that are covered by a means-tested state-led system who have to be registered to take advantage of the financial benefits, and those who pay privately for health care, either through an insurance-based system or through their own pocket.
Sometimes, as in France, there is no requirement to register but because insurance companies offer incentives, 90% of patients do.
In Europe, Family Doctors may act as gate-keepers, as they do in the UK, or as signposts where they just act as a conduit to secondary care. The second course means that they do not deal with chronic disease management so do not have the pressures that the increasing shift to general practice of disease management that used to be dealt with in hospital clinics. In many EU states, children are seen by paediatricians not by GPs and gynaecological problems are referred for examination and investigation to gynaecologists.
Elderly people who are resident in nursing homes may be under the care of Community Physicians or, as in Holland, Nursing Home Doctors. Mental illness may be referred directly to secondary care.
Workload and practice
List sizes vary from 600 per GP in Belgium to 3,500 per GP in Turkey and consultation rates per GP vary from 10 a day to 50 a day. This figure is confused by the fact that some replies counted telephone consultations as well where other nations just rated face-to-face consultations.
Group practices are gradually becoming the norm throughout Europe, though Belgium still has only 3% of practices with more than one doctor. In Italy roughly 50% of practices are group practices and in the Netherlands about 75%. The UK is still far ahead with more than 90% of practices being group practices. E also have larger groups of doctors. In much of Europe practices have 2-3 doctors as opposed to our average of 6-7.
Most have list sizes of 1600 or lower and that I itself makes for a less stressful environment. The working day generally approaches the normal for the working population of the country being 8 hours a day or fewer – in the Danish system GP surgeries close at 4 pm on Monday to Thursday and at 2 pm on Friday. The health of the Danish population does not seem to be adversely affected by this restriction of GP hours of access. However despite this 76% of EU nations feel that general practice workload is unreasonable and unsustainable.
If the nations that think the workload in general practice is reasonable are examined, they tend to have some factors in common. They have a normal working day – that is, eigth hours or fewer and mostly have a list size of 1600 or fewer per GP. They are more likely to have longer consultations and, of course, have easier access into secondary care beds. However, the factor that seems to be the most important is the number of patient consultations per doctor per day.
Consultation length and duration
Most nations have 15 minute consultations with the Scandinavian countries veering towards 20-25 minutes. Those nations with 25 consultations or less a day find general practice manageable. Those nations who either have telephone consultations or face-to-face consultations that exceed 25 patient contacts a day per doctor find general practice unsustainable. They have problems in both retaining GPs and in recruiting newly qualified doctors to a GP training programme.
Home visits
Most do little home visiting – though this may be due to the greater availability of beds in European countries. The UK has the lowest bed numbers per 100,000 population in Europe with France having double the beds and Germany three times as many. This means that admission of sick patients is more or less the norm, rather tha, as in the UK, making huge efforts to keep patients out of hospital.
Summary
A profession under stress is a profession at risk. Maybe the answer is simply to reduce access to EU levels; to restrict doctor-patient contacts, both telephone and face-to-face consultations, to fewer than 25 a day. It may be possible to divert some demands to pharmacists, nurses or other health professionals. It may be possible to educate the public to self-care, at least for minor illnesses.
General practitioners are expensive and time-consuming to train. It would be sensible to use their skills carefully.

Thoughtful and interesting! Thank you for posting. Makes me realise just how many quarts we are already squeezing into a pint pot. Also validates my stress levels! We have become the cheap dumping ground for the NHS used by a population who increasingly don’t value a “free” service. General Practice in the UK is being strangled: Unless it is radically improved and better resourced it will die.

It all comes back to underfunding. The BMA needs I believe to run a publicity campaign to tell people they need to pay more or lose their service. We spend billions on gambling as well as in charity donations annually. Some of this money needs to come to the NHS urgently and we could achieve the care and job satisfaction of our European colleagues. Come on BMA!

German here. It would be interesting to see how workload varies between signposter GPs and gatekeeper GPs. It could be that workload is shifted onto specialists (as in Germany, where children see
pediatricians). Having moved from a signposter to a gatekeeper culture (the NHS), I must say that given a manageable workload, I find the UK system far more holistic and efficient.
In addition, it’s important to look at the support system that doctors have. German doctors’ assistants are often far less well trained and qualified than the practice nurses and midwives that work in a typical UK group practice.
It seems to me that the UK doesn’t realize what it has in its GP system.

Yes we realise all right !
Longer waiting times spent on phones just to get an appt. Longer waiting times just to get to see a GP. Longer waiting times to see a specialist and longer waiting times for test results
!!!
In Germany and in Thailand seeing a specialist, being sent for tests and getting test results at all got on the SAME day !!!
Plus you do not need to see a GP first, you can go directly to a specialist !

Elinor Gunning is an academic GP and UCL Clinical Teaching Fellow (@EJGun)
“So, in the future, can we just replace GPs with a diagnostic robot?”
Is it just me, or do other GPs hear this question a lot? Often it’s more commonly phrased ‘who needs a GP when you’ve got Google’, but the replacement of doctors with computer programs seems to be a recurring theme when discussing the technological future of medicine.
[bctt tweet=”BJGP Blog: Who needs a GP when you’ve got Google?”]
Most recently I heard this question posed during a Q&A session for ‘The Day Before Tomorrow’, a documentary exploring the impact of technological developments on health care. Part of the documentary addresses what is referred to as ‘quantified self’, a new movement which proposes that self-tracking our personal health data can improve our health. As a society we are suddenly generating an awful lot of health related data – industries have realised that consumers enjoy self- monitoring, and this has led to an explosion of devices and apps which record information such as heart rate, activity, weight and even mood. Perhaps these devices will become so advanced, it was argued, that one day they would interpret the data and diagnose us too – so who needs primary care?
This economic convergence of healthcare and technology is certainly generating a lot of money, but is it just a fad or can it benefit patients? As I sat in the audience, surrounded by representatives of private healthcare providers with dollar signs in their eyes, I wondered whether simply measuring these indicators can actually make us healthier? Where is the evidence that if I record my mood, activity and heart rate I will become happier, fitter and live longer? If an app told me each day that I wasn’t walking far enough, would this ultimately motivate me to change, or would I just turn my phone off? Can novel digital feedback ever be as effective as a consultation with a doctor who can ask me why I am less active and perhaps discover that I am depressed?
I have no doubt that with more research this vast amount of monitoring data will lead to improved diagnostics, chronic disease management and preventative medicine. But medicine needs the ‘art’ as well as the ‘science’, and that means human involvement. Robots may be cheaper, but we need doctors too, doctors who can empathise with our lives, listen to our worries, and, most crucially, don’t have an off-switch when they tell us what we want to ignore.

Yes, very much so. They hang together quite well these two posts – certainly some convergence but I’m not sure just how much capacity the future NHS (or current perhaps) has to embrace empathy as an outcome. Though, it is perhaps what most patients would really want.

Destination GP: How to help medical students become GPs
Posted by BJGP Life | 13 Dec 2017 | Undergraduate | 1
Written by Fisher D, Bull C, Blackadder-Weinstein J, Nicholls G, Hawthorne K.
Becoming a GP should be a highly sought-after medical speciality destination. As a career, general practice can be both flexible and diverse – with new models of care developing both in multi-disciplinary teams and ‘at scale’, opportunities in research, teaching, portfolio working and clinical extended roles. Expert generalist skills are based on holistic assessments of often undifferentiated and complex presentations, making diagnosis, management and co-production with patients intellectually challenging. So why are many medical students and newly qualified doctors being put-off choosing it as their speciality? Why are GP training places going unfilled?[1]
Destination GP based on a survey of UK medical students, published by the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Medical Schools Council, has shown that a key deterrent to choosing general practice as a career is likely to be caused by negativity towards general practice from academics, clinicians and/or other educational trainers. In total, 3680 students (9.4% of the total) across 30 medical schools responded, and 76% of these reported experiencing negative comments or attitudes towards general practice.
91% of respondents believed their peers had negative views about general practice.
Overall, 39% of students said that tutors from other specialities had put them off working in general practice, and 70% of final year students reported experiencing negativity towards general practice in a clinical environment. Only 3% of medical students said they thought general practice was intellectually challenging. Given that 91% of respondents believed their peers had negative views about general practice and 35% saw their peers as one of the most influential determinants of their views on general practice, helping students to build a clear and positive perspective early on in their medical training is essential. The current pressures and high workload of GPs are not going unnoticed by future doctors, with 72% of students perceiving negativity about general practice within the current political environment and in the media.
While knowledge about these issues has been published before,[2] [3] this is the first representative survey of medical students across the UK to produce significant evidence that denigration is widespread. However, the survey also found that GP advocates have real potential to deliver positive and impactful messages to students, and that experiences from GP placements can have a profound influence on student career choices. In the survey, 81% of students reported that GPs on placements had most influenced their perceptions of general practice. Academic GP tutors and medical school GP Societies also have an important role to play here. Four in ten (41%) students said their interaction with a GP Society had a positive influence on their interest in general practice, and 71% said that their academic GP tutors had made them more interested in becoming GPs.
The academic research basis of general practice is an important aspect of its intellectual appeal.
Giving these advocates more support is essential. The full-costs of student placements in general practice are not currently being met and practices receive substantially less for placements than in secondary care, despite costs being very similar. This must be corrected, to allow more practices to offer high-quality clinical placements, and give students opportunities from early in their training to meet positive role models for general practice. The academic research basis of general practice is an important aspect of its intellectual appeal but students need signposting to academic general practice within undergraduate curricula.
Destination GP sets out a series of recommendations to tackle these issues, and suggests that while the challenges may be daunting, there is much that can be done. The power of peer and role models needs to be fully appreciated, and the discourse that unthinkingly puts students off careers in general practice needs to change. Students need an accurate and informed picture of the current and future general practice landscape. Given the shortfall of GPs across the UK, and with worrying signs of an ongoing drop in numbers, taking urgent action is ever more important for the survival of general practice, and with it, the future of our healthcare service.

I think that FY2 posts in GP are even more powerful than undergraduate placements in enticing prospective GP’s.
It was feeling like I ‘fitted in’ during my FY2 post that led me to apply for GP Training.

Review: The Possibilities are Endless
Posted by Euan Lawson | 2 Feb 2015 | Arts | 0
Euan Lawson (@euan_lawson) is the Deputy Editor, BJGP.
In 2005, Edywn Collins had a brain haemorrhage. There’s no gentle intro to this film; it is immersive as we are plunged into a fragmentary sequence of memories, images and sounds. There’s footage of Helmsdale, the hills and the beaches where Edwyn and his family spend their time, and childhood memories collide with adulthood. Edwyn offers broken commentary, his voice hesistant, frequently stuck and unintelligible. Grace, his wife, speaks to Edwyn, and we can feel her at the bedside comforting him. It’s claustrophobic, frightening and frustrating. It’s also mesmerising and quietly horrific as we eavesdrop on an inner life where your brain is unanchored, adrift.
How do you reconstruct your life after a brain injury that leaves you with a hemiplegia and practically aphasic? His only words: Yes. No. Grace Maxwell. The possibilities are endless. He has to learn to read again. Edwyn draws the same rough portrait of a man again. And again. He struggles to remember how many days there are in a year. It took me a while to place Edwyn and it wasn’t until they showed a clip of his biggest chart hit, A Girl Like You, that I had him. A handsome, tall, prodigiously talented musician with a self-assured melodious Scottish accent. Grace and Edwyn just kept going, tiny amounts upwards and onwards. As Grace says, sometimes you just have to “suck it up”. The words of his songs start to come back to him and he sings again.
There is often a whiff of the condescending when relating life-affirming stories of the apparently afflicted. There’s no room in this story for any plastic admiration; nothing in this film plays on victimhood. It’s just Edwyn’s and Grace’s story with no smear of self-pity to blur the vision. This is not a motivational movie with the life story burnished so we may weep at the indomitable human spirit. It’s not making promises that by watching you will be a better person. Yet there is a quiet satisfaction here and an insight into brain injury that embraces the medium of cinema.
Spoiler: You will be disappointed if you are hanging out for a magical moment of recovery with all his memories and skills flooding back in an exultant moment of slow-mo triumph. Ultimately, we come to Edwyn as he his now: ribbing his wife; laughing with his son. He’s not where he was before 2005, perhaps not where he might have expected to be: but then who is? Edwyn is laconic: Possibly before my stroke I was a bit too focussed. He goes on in his staccato style: The next stage of my career. No, no, I was nice. Don’t get me wrong. But arrogant in a way. I’m over that phase.

The importance of self care for GPs: tackling burnout through comedy
Posted by BJGP Life | 19 May 2016 | Arts | 0
Ahmed Z Kazmi is a doctor and stand-up comedian. If you would like to see his show ‘Doctor in the House’ he will be performing at Brighton Fringe 20-24th May 2016, Hollywood Fringe 19th-26th June 2016 and Edinburgh Fringe Festival 4-14th August 2016. For lots more information and to purchase tickets please go to www.doctorahmed.net
At my medical school interview I was asked what I did to relax, I remember thinking that was an odd question. My GP training curriculum included lectures entitled ‘How to avoid burn out’ and I remember sighing and rolling my eyes. It was not until I was in the role of qualified GP for some time that I started to feel a drain on my wellbeing. Then in 2015 my father died from cancer and I really struggled to remain the empathetic and attentive doctor I had prided myself on being. The presence of grief and mourning added an additional ball to the juggling act of clinical duties, professional development tasks, administrative tasks, family and friend obligations and the banal tasks of daily living, and I found myself struggling. I suddenly saw the relevance of the question asked of me at my medical school interview and the rationale for the lecture on burn.
I think it is fair to say general practice is a high intensity occupation. The high volume of patient contacts per day plus the short consultation duration coupled with often unrealistic patient expectations create a sense of panic and unrest during the working day. The relatively frequent rearrangement of service structure and health policy combined with a constant media flurry around the NHS and general practice can produce for many GPs a gloomy atmosphere within which to work. This environment was sadly a contributing factor in my decision to move from the UK in 2014 and practice in Australia.
As mentioned earlier, it was not until last year that the importance of non-academic outlets and self care became evident to me. I used to consider exams or diplomas or courses a leisurely parallel to my role as a GP. I loved to learn, enjoyed keeping up to date and saw an update course as a luxury activity. With social media being inundated constantly with healthcare politics I found myself almost totally unable to switch off from the job, even in my personal time,
and for the first time decided to temporarily reduce my working hours and take up a hobby unrelated to my vocation. But alas the apple never falls far from the tree. I decided to try my hand at stand up comedy (not after an unsuccessful attempts at becoming a pole dancer and instagrammer respectively) and quickly had to embrace that my work as a GP was in fact my largest source humour. I decided to make a stand up show about the funny side of being a doctor. I wished to create something that would be playful and entertaining whilst remaining respectful to patients and the profession. I took a few months to write and rehearse the cabaret comedy show ‘Doctor in the House; What your doctor really thinks’ and made my comedy debut at the Perth Fringe Festival in February 2016. All my shows sold out and I received positive reviews from critics, colleagues and spectators. I managed to raise over $5000 AUS for a local cancer charity from ticket sales and donations. In addition to this I used the show as a vehicle for some more serious subtexts including patient responsibility, cancer awareness and bereavement. Above all the experience did renew my empathy and interest in my vocation.
The experience taught me that even in this current climate we can create opportunities for fun and laughter around our work. It is all too easy to become stationary in a vehicle stuck in mud where the wheels are turning but the car is not moving forward. Several of my friends had hobbies during medical school: music, art, fitness but sadly these were made redundant as general practice and family pressures grew. I would encourage the reader to gently reflect on the following questions:
Do you feel content at work?
Do you feel you are nearing burn out?
If you are content, well done, how can you ensure that continues? If not how might you address it?
Think of one or two hobbies/interests/activities (big or small!) you would like to do more of or have never tried and would like to sample.
Lastly think about how you might actually start to undertake the activity and create room for it in your life.
I am not suggesting everyone take a four month sabbatical and go on a world fringe festival tour of their solo stand-up comedy show… But I think now more than ever it is imperative for GPs to become good at self-care. Yoga? Swimming? Mindfulness meditations? Reduction in sessions? Cookery class? Or, yes, even stand-up comedy. What would you say to your patient in a similar position, need I say more!

Poems for Doctors: a video
Posted by BJGP Life | 18 Sep 2018 | Arts | 0
Written by Lesley Morrison. This year, for the fourth year, all Scottish medical graduates were gifted Tools of the Trade, the little pocket sized book of poetry published by the Scottish Poetry Library and intended to provide support for new doctors as they embark on their very demanding new professional lives, and to encourage their creativity.
In collaboration with the Scottish Poetry Library, the School of Medicine at the University of St Andrews University Medical School has produced lovely video recordings of some of the poems and the latest was released on 5th July as a 70th birthday present for the NHS. The recordings and the story of the project, taken forward thanks to the support of the dean, Professor David Crossman, and other senior staff members and the expertise of Steve Smart, poet, visual artist, and information designer, can be heard and read at
http://med.st-andrews.ac.uk/poemsfordoctors/ .
The readings are by medical professionals and students who have chosen a poem for particular reasons or resonances which they describe, and they are moving and powerful.
Each reading provides a seed for informal discussion in a Facebook group managed by a group of experienced doctors. The intention is to facilitate an online discussion about these very relevant and affecting issues and conditions and in doing so to foster a community of encouragement and support.
A video installation of the readings has been on site at St Andrews Medical School and been taken to several conferences and seminars.
Listen, enjoy, reflect and pass on!
Work is about to begin on the third edition of “Tools of the Trade” (the second edition sold out!) which further feeds into the work of the Scottish medical humanities group promoting the introduction of more medical humanities into Scottish medical schools curricula
(www.scottishmedicalhumanities.org).
For teachers, the Scottish Poetry Library has recently published an equivalent beautiful little book, Learn for the future, available through the website, www.spl.org.

Pain, opioids, and syringe drivers: a practical guide
Posted by BJGP Life | 1 Oct 2018 | Clinical | 0
Pain, Opioids and Syringe Drivers: A Practical Guide for the GP in the Wake of Gosport
This article is written by Daniel Knights, Felicity Knights and Stephen Barclay and is published as a companion piece to their editorial in the October 2018 issue of the BJGP.
The publication of the Jones Report investigating the excess mortality at Gosport Memorial Hospital is one in a series of end-of-life care issues that have hit the UK news. The underlying system failures are unfortunately far from new to the NHS; with the report echoing inter alia, the Kennedy Report and the Berwick Report, highlighting the need for system changes and support for whistle-blowers, as explored in the recent BJGP editorial by Pocock et al.(1)
Concerns around GP prescription of opioids may be particularly heightened due to Dr Barton’s professional background as a GP.
However, the ramifications of this particular scandal are also likely to affect public and patient perspectives on opioids and use of syringe drivers, particularly at the end-of-life, as we discuss in a linked BJGP editorial. Anecdotally, health professionals are already reporting questions arising in the wake of the recent coverage. For example, a relative on an elderly care ward recently questioned opioid prescribing, asking ‘Aren’t those the drugs that kill people, from the news?’, and when emphasising the need to move to comfort care ‘But how do you know that those painkillers are what they need: they aren’t talking?’ Through some careful communication and use of terminology, and offering a second opinion, it was possible to reassure these relatives and build their trust, but this has already demonstrated how clinicians could be finding themselves in sticky situations in the wake of Gosport.
Concerns around GP prescription of opioids may be particularly heightened due to Dr Barton’s professional background as a GP, so it is important that GPs are equipped to answer questions in a clear and honest way. Here we list some possible questions with responses framed in patient-friendly language, which we hope will help to provide some practical tips for GPs faced with these concerns.
1) What are opioids and are there any alternatives?
Opioids are chemicals which reduce the sensation of pain.
They are present naturally in the body whether or not we are experiencing pain.
The main prescribed strong opioids are morphine and diamorphine, which originate from the poppy plant.
The body changes diamorphine into morphine and then changes morphine into an active form that works to control pain.
There are synthetic versions of morphine, such as oxycodone and fentanyl, which act in slightly different ways, but are all strong opioids.
Codeine, dihydrocodeine and tramadol are known as weak opioids: they are mostly converted into morphine or related compounds in the body.
Most causes of pain will respond to morphine and related strong opioids.
There are not any effective alternatives to opioids for severe pain in most situations.
There are other medications which work on other types of pain, such as nerve pain.
Opioids are also sometimes used in low doses to treat breathlessness.
2) Are opioids effective for other symptoms such as agitation?
In short, no!
Symptoms other than pain and breathlessness in advanced disease and at the end of life are not effectively treated with opioids.
We always try to control symptoms with non-drug measures where possible, but when drugs are needed:
anxiety responds best to drugs such as midazolam.
confusion respond best to drugs such as haloperidol or levomepromazine.
If there is suspicion that agitation is being caused by undiagnosed pain, then a trial of a one-off opioid dose may be appropriate.
However if opioids are being used in the absence of pain or breathlessness, this should be questioned.
3) Do opioids hasten death, prevent recovery or cause addiction?
Research has clearly shown that when opioids are used in appropriate doses to control pain, they do not decrease survival. (2)
When used in the pain control setting, patients do not get a “high” when using opioids, as occurs when they are used in substance abuse.
Research has also shown that when used correctly, should the pain subsequently ease then the opioid dose can be gradually reduced or stopped, meaning that they do not cause addiction or prevent recovery. (2)
If used in the absence of pain, or in excessive doses that are not in proportion to the level of pain, opioids may shorten life. This is what happened in Gosport.
4) What are the side-effects of opioids and how can I know if too much opioid has been given?
Side-effects are unwanted effects of a drug and do not indicate that an excessive dose has been given. Three common opioid side-effects are:
Constipation: most patients need a laxative.
Feeling / being sick: this occurs in about a third of patients, often settles within a few days and is usually well controlled by haloperidol.
Mental clouding: some people feel that they “cannot think straight” for a few days after starting opioids, but this usually settles within three days. If it does not settle, it is common to switch to the alternative opioid oxycodone and / or ask for specialist advice.
Toxicity occurs when someone is given too much opioid.
Pointers to “opioid toxicity” include: muscle twitching, confusion, hallucinations, drowsiness, pinpoint pupils and reduced rate of breathing.
It is the reduced breathing that increases the risk of death in major overdose.
When someone has evidence of toxicity, the dose of opioid must be reduced even if they are still in pain and alternative ways of controlling the pain must be found. Advice from a palliative care specialist is commonly needed.
5) Aren’t syringe drivers dangerous?
The NHS now only uses modern syringe drivers, not the Graseby ones that were used at Gosport and later withdrawn for safety reasons.
A syringe driver gradually empties the contents of a syringe into the patient over 24 hours, given into the tissues under the skin, not into a vein.
They are particularly useful when a patient is no longer able to take medicines by mouth: they avoid the need for painful repeated injections and ensure a steady level of medication in the body.
The drugs prescribed for syringe driver need to be carefully chosen to be the right ones, in the right dose for the symptom(s) that the patient is experiencing, as already described.
In Gosport, excessive doses of opioids, usually diamorphine, were given to patients via syringe drivers who often had little or no pain. This was unacceptable practice and shortened the lives of many patients.
6) How do you know if someone is in pain if they aren’t conscious?
At this stage of illness, pain can be flagged by distressed facial expressions, clutching of a part of the body, groaning, distress on being moved or examined and agitation.
This needs skilled assessment by doctors and nurses. These flags can indicate pain, but may also indicate other problems such as a full bladder needing a catheter or agitation not due to pain.
It is helpful for family members to look out for these things and tell the doctors and nurses that they are happening.

Is it time we reflect on the true value of reflection?
Posted by Edward Schwarz | 31 Aug 2016 | AiT, Opinion | 0
It is a Sunday evening. I look across at my GP ST1 wife and see her feverishly tapping the keyboard. I enquire what she is doing. “I have to do a couple of reflections, I’ve only done one this week.”
Reflection has become a major part of trainees and GPs’ lives alike. Most follow tried and tested models such as Gibbs1, to look back on an experience, challenge one’s own performance or thinking and see if this has led to learn new things or perhaps shape the way one behaves in the future. Sometimes, it may involve a patient whom has made a complaint, or an error you have made, or a system has failed and just like with the aviation industry that encourages transparency, can provide a platform with which to voice your thoughts and feelings.
As a guide, you are expected to do two reflections a week as a GP trainee. This helps form the basis of evidence to demonstrate competence in a certain curriculum area. So there lies another quandary – you may feel competent in an area but unless you have recounted an experience that demonstrates this adequately you will not pass. Recently, a reflection by a doctor was used by the prosecution in court against them.2. Since then, there have been numerous press releases by governing bodies, including Health Education England that have tried to reassure trainees that reflection is here to stay and as long as patient identifiable data is removed, will continue for the foreseeable future.
This case has now exposed prescriptive reflection for what it is – a cheap way of monitoring and ensuring training is completed. If one cannot be completely open and honest without the threat of it being used against you, then the result is not true reflective practice. If writers are not expressing their innermost thoughts and challenging themselves completely open and honestly, then they are providing just the right mix of intrigue to satisfy the college but without really engaging in the process. It becomes merely a tick box exercise – “I have been told I should reflect, I don’t want to be too honest and I have been given an arbitrary figure of two reflections per week so I better complete them.” This is just as bad as making a reflection up to fit into a curriculum box and both would contradict the GMC recommendation, “being open and honest”.
So is it time to move away from this model? Can reflection simply be spontaneous? My parents, both retired doctors, and their friends find it laughable that so much of our time is taken up by reflection. They were brilliant doctors and yet their personal learning wasn’t filled up with recounting their experiences on paper. Their reflection came in different formats. Sitting with a glass of wine and discussing your day either to a medical or a non medical friend or relative is valid reflection. It gives the opportunity to voice out loud one’s feelings and evaluate what you think you did well or could do better. The listeners can offer their own insights based on their experiences.
Some experiences may affect you so much, that they are good discussion points with which to base tutorials on with supervisors without the need for committing it to paper. If people find it useful to write down their experiences, they could keep a diary. There is a very real risk that training is shaping doctors to all conform to the same mould and dissuading really intelligent and reflective doctors into embarking on a career that requires them to complete these exercises.
No one has been able to tell me why reflection has such recent success and emphasis, or where its popularity came from. I want to be a brilliant GP who makes a real difference to my patients but I am worried my time will be focussed on completing these reflections in place of learning and keeping myself up to date. We have been advised to just embrace it – something my wife is struggling to do on her Sunday evening off. In a world of evidence based practice, where is the evidence that reflections are making us better doctors?
So what in place of prescriptive reflection I hear you ask? Well, I don’t have the answer to that question, but I need to finish my second reflection for the week so I’ll try and tackle it then – this is portfolio gold.

GP home visits: more evidence is urgently needed to inform debate
Posted by BJGP Life | 3 Dec 2019 | Research | 0
This article is written by Drs Sarah Mitchell, Sarah Hillman, David Rapley, and Professor Jeremy Dale from the Unit of Academic Primary Care based at Warwick Medical School.
The general practitioner (GP) home visit has long been regarded core to general practice in the UK and Western Europe (1). However, at the recent Local Medical Committee Conference in November 2019, after heated debate about GP capacity to deliver home visits, a motion was passed with 54% of the vote, to instruct the General Practitioners Committee (GPC – the negotiating arm of the British Medical Association) to “remove the anachronism of home visits from core contract work”. 74% of voters backed a motion to “negotiate a separate acute service for urgent visits”. Health Secretary Matt Hancock immediately rejected the outcome of the vote, promising extra resources for training and funding for more GPs and practice staff.
For others, home visits are considered core to general practice.
The ensuing debate in the national media, GP press and social media, highlighted a remarkable diversity of views around the value of home visits. Some propose that patients should not be able to “demand” home visits as an entitlement or alternative to a surgery appointment. For others, home visits are considered core to general practice and there are concerns that removing them from the GP contract would “sell the heart and soul of our profession away”, sending a message to patients that their doctor no longer cares for them.
What is unclear is the extent to which the debate about home visiting is intended to highlight the pressure that primary care is under, or whether it is truly about the value of home visits. The building pressure and demand on primary care is well documented and forms the basis of a number of high profile campaigns. The growing complexity of the aging population, with highly complex multi-morbidity, and diverse family and social situations, plays an important part. So do many other factors, many of which are eloquently listed by GP Dr Margaret McCartney on Twitter following the LMC vote; managing the problems caused by drug shortages, missed hospital appointments, supporting patients with troublesome symptoms when hospital outpatient appointments or surgery is delayed, and writing letters of support for employment tribunals and housing applications. Perhaps by addressing some of these, as Dr McCartney suggests, GPs would have more time to visit housebound and highly vulnerable patients, including those approaching the end of life.
It is striking that the GP home visit has practically no evidence base to enhance understanding of its purpose or role.
In a healthcare system where it is expected that contracts are underpinned by evidence-based medicine, it is striking that the GP home visit has practically no evidence base to enhance understanding of its purpose or role. The scant amount of research evidence that is available suggests that there is unwillingness amongst younger GPs to provide home visits (2), but GPs who gain experience of home visits during their training are more likely to undertake home visiting post qualification (2). There is also a positive association between GP home visit rates and achieving end of life care at home (3). However, there is little evidence about the outcome of home visits, the impact on patient care or the role of the GP, or other members of the primary care team, during those visits.
Furthermore, current training in home visits is limited. For GP trainees, their home visits may not be observed or monitored and they receive little guidance or feedback on how best to conduct the visit. Barriers to assessment include logistical constraints, staff and safety concerns (4). Summative assessment of home visits (within the MRCGP Clinical Skills Assessment) occurs in only half of exams and not in a realistic setting. Formative assessment tools (Clinical Observational Tools COTS) for home visits are lacking.
There are also significant challenges in undertaking accurate clinical assessments of a patient’s condition.
GPs undertake home visits for a range of different reasons. Some are reactive when there is an acute and sudden deterioration in a patient’s health. Others are more proactive, involve the development of relational continuity of care between GPs and patients, which is especially important for patients who are unable to travel to the GP because of chronic disease, palliative care and other serious debilitating conditions. Assessing a patient in their home differs to a surgery setting. While there is potential to understand how a patient functions in their usual environment, and the effects on their health, there are also significant challenges in undertaking accurate clinical assessments of a patient’s condition, particularly when they are acutely unwell. The lack of point of care testing in general practice compounds the problem (5).
In 2003 when the last major reorganisation of the GP contract occurred, 24/7 care was removed. Such changes in out of hours care provision have been associated with compromised continuity of care and subsequent increased rates of admission to hospital during out of hours periods. Given that those whom GPs visit are among the most complex and frail in the community it is likely that removing home visits may result in a higher hospital admission rate, overburdening an already over-stretched secondary care system.
Visits to patients living with medical and social complexity, and those needing continuity of care, must be carried out by GPs.
If GPs retain home visiting in their core working day, then they can (and should) decide who does them. Visits to patients living with medical and social complexity, and those needing continuity of care, must be carried out by GPs; the less complex and perhaps those for nursing homes can be delegated to advanced nurse practitioners or physicians’ assistants. GPs are used to managing uncertainty and risk, abrogating this responsibility risks diluting patient care.
More research is required to inform debate about home visits and the GP contract, particularly taking into account the diverse views that seem to exist amongst GPs. However, robust research will be challenging because the home visit is a complex, multifactorial process, rather than a discrete intervention. Research is needed to provide increased understanding into the nuances and impact of the GP home visit, who it provides benefits to, how, when and why. This would form an important evidence base to inform not only the debate about contract decisions but also the future training and development of the primary care workforce to deliver timely and effective care in the community, and should be considered an urgent priority by research funders and academics in primary care.

‘An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind’ – reflections on working with Syrian refugees
Posted by BJGP Life | 30 Jun 2016 | International, Opinion, Political | 0
Dr Nikesh Parekh
Nikesh Parekh is a GP trainee, a research fellow in ageing and part-time public health medical associate in London. Colin Tourle is a semi-retired GP in Hailsham.
There are 1.5 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, of which the vast majority are hidden away in camps near the Syrian border. These are some of the most impoverished victims of the war in Syria, who lack the financial resource to travel further afield for safety.
With the support of Iasis medical charity (www.iasis.org.uk), we were privileged to travel to three refugee camps within a mile of the Syrian border in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley to provide medical clinics.
The camps encompass vast swathes of land with back to back tents. Word would spread that doctors have come to offer free help and before long a mass of people, usually 75% women and children, would be gathered outside eager to be seen. Crowd control was nothing short of the chaos at a sporting event! It was hard seeing children queuing outside a dust filled tent waiting for us to see them when one could only feel they should be playing in a garden somewhere with a football or trampoline.
We had never quite anticipated how varied the presentations might be, from the expected urine and skin infections, to eczema, to renal stones, to muscle pains, to hypoglycaemic episode, to a likely bone malignancy. Recognising the likely bone cancer in a 7-year old boy was particularly moving. This child needed a haematologist and costly intervention. How on earth will this really happen – where is there a specialist hospital unit? Will the Lebanese doctor discriminate against the Syrian? Who will transport the child back and forth? Who will cover the costs? Who will look after the immunocompromised child if chemotherapy is the treatment of choicer? Is it too late anyway? These were all the kinds of questions one reflects on, and the unknowns are heart breaking.
Making a diagnosis is always a game of probability, but never really more so than in this resource limited setting, where health literacy of patients was minimal and gathering a good history was challenging even with translators. Attention was often diverted onto their painful stories of loss and despair in this prolonged war with no end in sight. The refugees just want to go back to Syria, the land where they grew up, where they had a living, where they had good memories with their families and friends, and where they were individuals as opposed to ‘refugees’. They certainly do not want to make a trip to Europe as far as possible.
Various pressures were on us and it is emotionally, physically and logistically intense – seeing as many people as wanted to be seen, being in a completely unfamiliar clinical setting where the concept of privacy in a medical consultation is non-existent, knowing that unless someone is life-threateningly ill you wanted to avoid hospital because patients knew that it was chargeable and would be reluctant to go. No one has money, and dignity is dying out fast.
There were some just excited by the opportunity to see some new faces in their camp. We knew they were not sick and they knew they were not sick but we accepted this and made a non-verbal deal; We would examine them and show off the stethoscope and they wouldn’t spend too long pretending to have a problem with every organ system. These sorts of cases made us both reflect on a question one inevitably has at the back of their mind but we didn’t dare ask for fear of the answer – how much of a medical difference am I truly making? – but we realised that we don’t need to answer this question because there was no doubt that the presence of a doctor to show care and provide reassurance without asking for anything in return was worth gold. It gave back some dignity, reminded these innocent victims that they are humans and that the world cares for them. They are not forgotten despite their isolation behind white plastic tent sheets labeled with the blue, bold letters ‘UNHCR’.

Going back to the start – influencing prospective medical students
Posted by BJGP Life | 27 Aug 2015 | Opinion, Undergraduate | 0
James Pearson is an ST3 trainee in Bath and the education scholar for the year.
Suddenly you are sitting there alongside all these very intelligent people and the familiar world of sixth form seems so far away. I still remember my first day at medical school when the year group were told in our welcoming lecture that the majority of us would become GPs. I distinctly remember my reaction and that of all my peers was one of surprise and shock! How could they suggest something as absurd as that?
At that point, our exposure to medicine had mostly involved work experience in secondary care and for a few of us, some volunteering in the charity sector. Only a rare handful had managed to secure some experience in primary care. This was mainly by means of a relative or friend with suitable contacts as there are many barriers; issues with confidentiality and perceived maturity of students to name but two. Looking back, it seemed as though we were programmed from the start and had no aspiration for General Practice – we only had personal experience and tales from the media to inform us.
Consequently, I decided to set out on a quest in my role as the ST3 Bath patch Educational Scholar to try and change this locally. I also wanted to provide an excellent opportunity for GP trainees to lead and organise a placement as well as some experience in supervision. Working alongside my counterpart in the Bristol area (Dr Howse) we recruited 32 sixth formers from schools in the local area who were planning to apply to medicine in the current academic cycle. They were a shortlist of the best as determined by their application form, personal statement and teacher reference including predicted grades. We were overwhelmed by applicants and had to turn away those unless they had a realistic chance of a successful application to medical school.
By meeting them all at our carefully planned one-day preparation course, I observed their enthusiasm for medicine and it was rewarding to be able to enlighten them on topics such as ‘the role of the GP’ and ‘members of a practice team’. It was astounding to hear their views in small group work and as predicted from this and their pre-course questionnaires, their views on General Practice were misled and mistaken. It gave us the chance to set the record straight, promote our career, brief them on confidentiality and explain our expectations of prospective medical students. Overall the feedback we received at the end seemed to have a positive impact on their attitudes and all were keen to undertake the offered work experience in General Practice.
Using the demographic knowledge obtained from the application form, we were able to ensure that no student lived or went to school in the area their allocated practice was based. This had previously been one major barrier when pupils had contacted their local practice and were declined for fear of them knowing some of the patients. They were then allocated a GP trainee and left to liaise together about suitable dates as well as the format of their work experience. Further information from the pre-course questionnaires on three things the pupil wanted to get out of the experience helped trainees plan specific activities for the individual. For example, my allocated student was able to spend time with different members of the practice team and really enjoyed watching minor surgery done at the practice. She was amazed at the variety of things that were on offer and the array of opportunities available.
The first year of this project is now coming to a close and certainly each student now has a subsidiary mentor who could help them through the application process. I really hope that this has given realistic prospective medical students an insight in to primary care and we were able to overcome the barriers to gain the experience. I am not intending to suddenly convert all these students in to budding GPs but I really feel that at the moment as a profession we are not doing enough to promote our career to this group of young minded individuals where a lot of their early experiences can shape their ideas on the future.
Let’s hope that their reaction at their first day at medical school to the obligatory statement of “most people will be GPs” is different to my year group’s.

Trainee notes: Life school
Posted by BJGP Life | 2 Mar 2016 | AiT, Opinion | 1
Aisha Yahaya is a GP ST2 with Imperial VTS who has an interest in effective communication with patients, writing and a yearly resolution to save her guitar from the dusty corner in which it sits.
Increasingly, I learn more about the way of the world by looking through the eyes of my patients.
As I reflect on my time spent in a large urban GP surgery, I share my feelings and what I learnt from the patient narrative.
Bravery, active listening and understanding. Very often, a patient will come with a problem that has troubled them for a while and their appointment with me is the first time they have mustered enough courage to seek help.
I was faced with this scenario when a patient told me they were uncomfortable with their identity and wanted to change this. In this case I learnt about bravery.
Patients take steps to help themselves by asking me for help or guidance. This is a sign of strength and it gives me a chance to empower them to take control of their health, wellbeing and happiness. I often expect patients to trust me easily and follow my advice, which makes me question why they would do so and how willing I would be to do the same if in their shoes.
I am aware of how perceptive patients can be of their doctor’s mood and a balance must be struck when navigating my feelings and theirs.
The difference between a successful or disastrous consultation could be the blank gaze I give a patient if my mind is elsewhere, compared with a simple nod of acknowledgement or the offer of a tissue when they are crying.
In a room with just the patient and me, there is nowhere to hide and this allows vulnerability to thrive.
In order to gain a patient’s trust I have found that putting them at ease and inviting open dialogue goes a long way. There is a reason why patient satisfaction questionnaires that are mostly aimed at a doctor’s attitude towards a patient rather than their breadth of knowledge, which of course goes without saying.
Bigger is not always better. I am sometimes disheartened when I feel I have not made a difference to my patient’s problem.
Despite this, I learnt that whatever the patient describes as a positive effect could be more important than what I think is significant or obvious. For example this could be the case of a simple lifestyle change in a patient with low mood or chronic disease. My GP trainer picked up on a management plan from my entry in a patient’s medical notes during a follow up appointment and asked the patient about it.
The plan was a single goal that the patient and I were confident they could achieve.
My trainer told me that the documentation and acknowledgement of this plan made the patient feel as though they had been listened to and taken seriously.
I find this encouraging and hopefully the patient felt as though they had genuine support from me and the other doctors.
My job as a GP trainee often doubles up as a life school where sometimes the most important lessons are learnt.
As always, I look forward to the next one.

My story of everyday scholarship in general practice
Posted by BJGP Life | 26 Apr 2017 | Opinion, Scholarship | 1
Faraz Mughal is a GP in Birmingham and the RCGP Clinical Fellow in Children and Young People’s Mental Health. He is on Twitter: @farazhmughal
Making scholarship part of my daily practice contributes to the intellectual challenge and enjoyment of my work in general practice.
Self-harm affects 1 in 12 child or young people (CYP).1 Nearly 10% of 5-16 year-olds have a mental health illness which means in an average school class of 30 schoolchildren, three will suffer from a diagnosable mental health disorder. With increasing pressures facing young people in all aspects of their lives, the rates of mental illness are likely to rise. CYP mental health is thus a challenge for GPs everywhere.
At the frontline, we as GPs detect mental health illness; whether it presents as a physical health symptom, through parental/family concern, or simply an instinct you have when seeing a CYP in surgery. It is known that CYP with mental illness are twice as likely to attend to see their GP.1 Mental health is something we should be all thinking in every CYP we see.
But it can be an area of practice that we all find difficult, we can feel uncomfortable tackling this clinical area. Locally GPs have described, both personal issues (a lack of training) and service problems (difficulties accessing specialist services) as reasons for this.
In my own practice, I realised that there were limited resources available in this area and that accessing support from specialist services was difficult. I explored this further and realised others were experiencing similar problems. So, I began to think about how I could help address this, how I could improve my own practice while also helping the wider primary care community?
When RCGP advertised an opportunity to become the RCGP Clinical Fellow for CYP Mental Health I grabbed the chance to apply (these are regularly advertised through the RCGP so do keep an eye out!). Through this role, I have been part of an enthusiastic team developing quick-access resources for GPs and primary care staff to use in consultations with patients (accessed through the RCGP Mental Health Toolkit: http://www.rcgp.org.uk/clinical-and-research/toolkits/mental-health-toolkit.aspx). I also have the chance to influence policy through pushing for improvements in national and local services for CYP mental health. In addition, we have developed ‘TopTips’ articles for GPs on self-harm and eating disorders in CYP with more in the pipeline.
We are always thinking of how we can support GPs and if you would like to get involved with the college on working in this area, please do get in touch, we would be really pleased to hear from GPs and primary care professionals who want to work with us.

Evolving General Practice: Artificial Intelligence and Primary Care
Posted by BJGP Life | 7 Jan 2019 | Bright Ideas and Innovation | 0
RCGP Report on AI
The Clinical Innovation and Research Centre (CIRC) at the RCGP works with GPs and practice staff, supporting them to deliver a better quality and level of care to their patients through a wide portfolio of projects. Find out more at https://www.rcgp.org.uk/clinical-and-research.aspx.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a hotly discussed topic for several years and has more recently been discussed in healthcare. There are articles on the potential impact for AI to completely change current approaches and replace people, causing widespread job loses.
In June 2017 the House of Lords appointed a committee to “consider the economic, ethical and social implications of advances in artificial intelligence”. The findings of the Committee were published in a report in April 2018. It was reported that AI has potential to replace jobs but, importantly, enhance many jobs and create new ones. At the end of 2017, the government also released the industry strategy white paper which presented AI and Data Economy as one of the four Grand Challenges facing the UK. In early 2018, the Wellcome Trust commissioned a report on AI focusing on healthcare highlighting many of the challenges facing AI.
The digital doctor powered by AI is a common feature of articles on AI and healthcare. However, there are still substantial technical developments needed before a digital doctor becomes possible. Possibly the biggest technical challenge is that AI is very good at doing a very specific task but struggles as tasks become broader.
But people, unlike machines, are good at empathy and relationships.
AI is already being used to support healthcare delivery, machines, unlike people, have a great capability for analysing vast amounts of data and looking for patterns. These can be used to provide answers to very specific queries. But people, unlike machines, are good at empathy and relationships. This approach where healthcare professionals use AI powered tools is still in its infancy but has potential to impact care provision. What is unclear is the best way for AI and healthcare professionals to work together to improve the deliver of healthcare.
The RCGP has released a report on artificial intelligence and primary care. The report aims to demystify what artificial intelligence is and the limitations and questions surrounding the use of AI in healthcare. It outlines the role of a professional body in supporting AI while safeguarding patients and supporting healthcare professionals to ensure the best possible care is provided.
The first in a series of reports can be found at the RCGP’s new page, Evolving General Practice.
For more information on our reports, please contact the Innovation Team at circ@rcgp.co.uk.

Child & Adolescent Mental Health Problems – Twitter Journal Club
Posted by BJGP Life | 6 Dec 2016 | Clinical, GP Journal Club | 0
Carrie Ladd is a part time NHS GP, a spare time RCGP Clinical Fellow in Perinatal Mental Health and a full time mum… doing overtime! You can find her on Twitter @LaddCar and she has a website.
On Sunday 28th November, Dr Lucy Pocock and I co-hosted a session of the Twitter based journal club #gpjc to discuss one of the emerging priority areas of General Practice – Child and Young People’s Mental Health. The BJGP paper we discussed was a systematic review of primary care practitioner’s perceptions to barriers in managing these problems. All contributors seemed to agree that GPs are seeing more and more cases of mental health problems in adolescents but there was some debate as to whether this piece taught us anything new about the challenges we face in supporting these young people.
The themes identified in this review as ‘barriers’ were familiar to those joining the discussion and they are in common with most other mental health sub-specialities. Fear of judgement or stigma may limit disclosure, concerns over confidentiality may limit discussion and lack of referral options locally may restrict what help is available. This review also highlighted a lack of confidence in GPs themselves recognising childhood mental health problems and this may prove a springboard piece of work to address this unmet need in the near future.
This was a large systematic review covering 4151 articles in initial stages with 43 being looked at in detail – 30 quantitative and 13 qualitative. The articles were from a range of countries and one of the points in our discussion questioned whether this undermined or strengthened the validity of the results. Although Australia and Ireland could be seen to have similar health systems/ socioeconomic factors to the UK, perhaps South Africa and Puerto Rico less so? Also many of these studies were not specifically GPs but paediatrics as well which is important to be aware of.
In the final section of the discussion, we looked at how we can mitigate these barriers and collaboration seemed a key theme. Several people suggested better lines of communication with our mental health colleagues. Quarterly MDTs between psychiatry/CMHT & the GP practice, Psychiatry colleagues spending a day a week in General Practice is being done in one innovative GP surgery. In another great example of collaborative working, a specialist eating disorder therapist is based in a predominantly University Population Bristol based GP practice.
Finally, close of discussion included signposting to the RCGP Mental Health Toolkit which is available free, open access to all and mention of Young Minds and MindEd resources which are well worth a look up if new to you. The conversation continued after the scheduled hour and the 10 minute consultation model was cast aside as not fit for purpose when a patient comes to talk about mental health problems with longer appointments welcomed by the #gpjc group.
It is clear that from the GPs who joined the discussions on Sunday, this is an area of general practice we could do better, and we need to galvanise interest and support for a society wide movement to raise awareness and prompt further investment in Child and Young People’s Mental Health services.
If you haven’t popped over on a Sunday evening, check out @GPjournalclub for their monthly discussion group – see you there.

‘An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind’ – reflections on working with Syrian refugees
Posted by BJGP Life | 30 Jun 2016 | International, Opinion, Political | 0
Dr Nikesh Parekh
Nikesh Parekh is a GP trainee, a research fellow in ageing and part-time public health medical associate in London. Colin Tourle is a semi-retired GP in Hailsham.
There are 1.5 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, of which the vast majority are hidden away in camps near the Syrian border. These are some of the most impoverished victims of the war in Syria, who lack the financial resource to travel further afield for safety.
With the support of Iasis medical charity (www.iasis.org.uk), we were privileged to travel to three refugee camps within a mile of the Syrian border in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley to provide medical clinics.
The camps encompass vast swathes of land with back to back tents. Word would spread that doctors have come to offer free help and before long a mass of people, usually 75% women and children, would be gathered outside eager to be seen. Crowd control was nothing short of the chaos at a sporting event! It was hard seeing children queuing outside a dust filled tent waiting for us to see them when one could only feel they should be playing in a garden somewhere with a football or trampoline.
We had never quite anticipated how varied the presentations might be, from the expected urine and skin infections, to eczema, to renal stones, to muscle pains, to hypoglycaemic episode, to a likely bone malignancy. Recognising the likely bone cancer in a 7-year old boy was particularly moving. This child needed a haematologist and costly intervention. How on earth will this really happen – where is there a specialist hospital unit? Will the Lebanese doctor discriminate against the Syrian? Who will transport the child back and forth? Who will cover the costs? Who will look after the immunocompromised child if chemotherapy is the treatment of choicer? Is it too late anyway? These were all the kinds of questions one reflects on, and the unknowns are heart breaking.
Making a diagnosis is always a game of probability, but never really more so than in this resource limited setting, where health literacy of patients was minimal and gathering a good history was challenging even with translators. Attention was often diverted onto their painful stories of loss and despair in this prolonged war with no end in sight. The refugees just want to go back to Syria, the land where they grew up, where they had a living, where they had good memories with their families and friends, and where they were individuals as opposed to ‘refugees’. They certainly do not want to make a trip to Europe as far as possible.
Various pressures were on us and it is emotionally, physically and logistically intense – seeing as many people as wanted to be seen, being in a completely unfamiliar clinical setting where the concept of privacy in a medical consultation is non-existent, knowing that unless someone is life-threateningly ill you wanted to avoid hospital because patients knew that it was chargeable and would be reluctant to go. No one has money, and dignity is dying out fast.
There were some just excited by the opportunity to see some new faces in their camp. We knew they were not sick and they knew they were not sick but we accepted this and made a non-verbal deal; We would examine them and show off the stethoscope and they wouldn’t spend too long pretending to have a problem with every organ system. These sorts of cases made us both reflect on a question one inevitably has at the back of their mind but we didn’t dare ask for fear of the answer – how much of a medical difference am I truly making? – but we realised that we don’t need to answer this question because there was no doubt that the presence of a doctor to show care and provide reassurance without asking for anything in return was worth gold. It gave back some dignity, reminded these innocent victims that they are humans and that the world cares for them. They are not forgotten despite their isolation behind white plastic tent sheets labeled with the blue, bold letters ‘UNHCR’.

BJGP Student Writing Competition – the winner
Posted by BJGP Life | 20 Jul 2015 | Opinion, Undergraduate | 1
Lydia Yarlott is in her final year at Oxford Medical School.
She is the winner of the 2015 BJGP Student Writing Competition themed ‘The GP in the Digital Age’ with her original article A Digital Ache.
Her tale of one GP versus the system will be horribly familiar to anyone who has done battle with the new digital bureaucracy of the NHS. It’s a rather wonderful reminder of the fundamental importance of maintaining relationships between doctors to benefit patients. The PDF version is embedded below – it needs the formatting to get the full benefit. Enjoy.

Review: A Fortunate Man
Posted by Roger Jones | 9 Feb 2015 | Arts, Opinion | 1
Professor Roger Jones is editor of the British Journal of General Practice.
A Fortunate Man: the story of a country doctor. John Berger and Jean Mohr. Canongate, London, 2015
First published in 1967, this is one of those must-read general practice books, essential for every trainer, trainee and practice library, and one, I suspect, which has been more frequently recommended than read. It has been re-issued this year in a new edition with an introduction by Dr Gavin Francis.
Anyone coming fresh to A Fortunate Man, expecting a paean to idyllic country general practice, will be disappointed, because the romanticised hero of John Berger’s extended essay is a deeply troubled individual to whom the epithet “fortunate” can be applied, at best, with irony.
Berger, now 88, is a distinguished critic and Booker Prize winner. He met the central character of the book, Dr John Eskell, as a patient in St Briavel’s, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, and became close friends with him. Eskell had been a Royal Naval surgeon during the war in the Mediterranean, and was now in single-handed practice following the death of his GP partner. Some time after Berger had left England for Geneva, Eskell, who becomes Dr John Sassall in the book, invited him and the photographer Jean Mohr to spend six weeks with his family and to shadow him round-the-clock in
his surgeries, on his many house calls and, presumably, in his domestic life, although this is not mentioned once In the book. Sassall was clearly a revelation to Berger, and the degree of connection, empathy, and acceptance that he showed to his patients, and the lengths that he went to, literally, to care for them are clearly regarded by Berger as both astonishing and exemplary. In describing Sassall’s actions and thoughts, and it is more often than not very difficult to know whether Sassall or Berger is doing the thinking, many of the core qualities and responsibilities of a general practitioner working in an isolated rural setting are perfectly captured.
However, Sassall’s hyper-commitment to his practice and his patients was, at least in part, a function of his manic-depression. Berger rather coolly describes Sassall’s lows, but doesn’t seem to quite understand the highs. Sassall’s wife, who ran his practice, died in 1981 and Sassall shot himself the following year. His professional life was troubled and he practised with little professional or, indeed, social contact. Whilst being admirably reflective and sensitive, he appeared to lack, or at least managed to avoid, any real recognition of his wider role as a general practitioner as an advocate for his practice population’s health or as a medical scientist. I can’t help making comparisons with Julian Tudor Hart, working wonders in Glyncorrwg, and John Fry laying the foundations of general practice research from his little practice in Beckenham.
I started reading this book 30-odd years ago and was put off by Berger’s often convoluted, freewheeling writing and Jean Mohr’s dreary photographs. I grew up in the Forest of Dean and, while recognising its comparative social isolation, bridled at Berger’s patronising depiction of Forest folk as uncultured half-wits, and still do. However, re-reading it at one sitting very recently, I recognised the limpid beauty of some of Berger’s prose, the subtlety of his descriptions of nature and of human interactions,
and his insights into the needs of ordinary people faced with illness, anguish and loss. His – or is it Sassall’s? – understanding of the role of the general practitioner as a witness and a “clerk of record”, needs to be widely understood, and never more so in these days of therapeutic miracles and performance indicators, when the unmeasurable essence of patient care can so easily be overlooked.

I have just finished reading ‘A Fortunate Man’ – literally fifteen minutes ago – and did a quick internet search as I wanted to find out whether others felt about it as I did. As an ordinary reader with no medical connections I felt that I was being made to feel inadequate, that I should have a great deal more knowledge of philosophy before I should allow myself to read it. I think quite genuinely that the unadorned story of his life among his community, although a very common subject, would have told us a great deal more about this dedicated doctor.
I suppose that what came over to me was that the book was far more about John Berger than it was about Dr Sassall. I wonder whether the reader is supposed to acknowledge Berger’s superior intellect, particularly when one compares it
to the low-brow status of the local hoi polloi. My impatience with John Berger reached a crescendo when I first realised how he despised the local people, how he suggested that a visit to the nearest town, or heaven forbid, to London, might be the highlight of their dull, plodding lives! The use of the generic description ‘foresters’ made me see red, reminding me of Hardy’s ‘The Woodlanders’.
No, all-in-all I closed the book with a feeling of anger, a feeling that Dr Sassall had been used by Berger as a vehicle for his own knowledge, his own views. Cynically, I wondered if this had anything to do with Sassall’s subsequent suicide! But having said that, there were many passages which I thoroughly enjoyed and seeking out one to copy into my book of quotations I chose ‘The privilege of being subtle is the distinction between the fortunate and the unfortunate’. It’s also fair to say that Berger did successfully convey to me the dedication and single-mindedness of the local family doctor and that alone would make the book worth the read.
As a keen amateur photographer however, I really couldn’t appreciate Jean Mohr’s photography. Some of the images did successfully illustrate the text – I particularly liked the out of focus figure leaving the consulting room on shown on page 52, which I felt put over well the comings and goings of all these anonymous people.
Otherwise I found his pictures dull and uninspiring, the sort of ‘rule-breaking’ that only a famous photographer could get away with!

Bright Ideas: improving access to digital health resources
Posted by BJGP Life | 9 Apr 2018 | Bright Ideas and Innovation | 0
QR info pods to provide waiting room resources
Steffan Gimblett of Pontardawe Primary Care Centre, Swansea was the winner of the inaugural Bright Ideas Awards in Wales.
The problem:
Our reception area was very cluttered with posters and didn’t communicate information to patients in a good way. We have an up to date website but we didn’t seem to promote online services to patients at all. We were spending a lot of money on printing leaflets and documents and needed to cut our costs and our carbon footprint.
The Bright Idea:
We produced a QR info pod for patients which contained links to all our online services, social media and relevant information about the practice. It also contains:
Links to an A-Z guide of self-help resources, including downloadable leaflets and videos
A section on local health initiatives
A section dedicated to vaccine resources and information
A section dedicated to UK wide health information such as antibiotics awareness, how to give blood and how to choose the right service.
Patients simply scan the code using their smartphone and they have instant access to the digital information we want them to see. We are also able to use Google Analytics to track how often each QR code is scanned giving us a way to measure the use of the pods. The system took six months to set up. We audited which documents we printed the most and decided what we wanted to communicate most to patients. We then contacted design and digital companies for prototypes and agreed on the best design.
The QR pods cost £280 to produce, however we are now saving at least £90 per month in print costs alone with additional savings on staff time and less administration. This monthly saving has recovered the costs of the pods. The digital interaction has enabled the use of a new way to engage with patients and get feedback.
The impact:
Patients. Availability to scan practice and health information to their smart phone to be read at a time convenient to them.
There has been great feedback from patients for the effort put into communicating with patients.
Workforce. Time saved on having to identify and print documents for patients.
Practice. We have experience an upsurge in our Twitter followers and online registrations of nearly 300%.
There has been a drastic drop in the amount of forms we print for patients as they can be scanned, leading to practice cost savings.
We are now working with Barnardos, Childline, the NSPCC and the Police as they have asked us to design and produce a QR Info Pod aimed at 11-19 year olds promoting the services they offer.

Bright Ideas for General Practice
The RCGP’s Bright Ideas initiative recognises that GPs and practice staff regularly see opportunities to improve their practice, and often do so by taking a fresh and innovative approach. We want these new approaches to be recognised, celebrated and shared, to inspire other practices to consider implementing ideas which have been successful elsewhere to address issues in their practice and to encourage innovative thinking across general practice.

Pain, opioids, and syringe drivers: a practical guide
Posted by BJGP Life | 1 Oct 2018 | Clinical | 0
Pain, Opioids and Syringe Drivers: A Practical Guide for the GP in the Wake of Gosport
This article is written by Daniel Knights, Felicity Knights and Stephen Barclay and is published as a companion piece to their editorial in the October 2018 issue of the BJGP.
The publication of the Jones Report investigating the excess mortality at Gosport Memorial Hospital is one in a series of end-of-life care issues that have hit the UK news. The underlying system failures are unfortunately far from new to the NHS; with the report echoing inter alia, the Kennedy Report and the Berwick Report, highlighting the need for system changes and support for whistle-blowers, as explored in the recent BJGP editorial by Pocock et al.(1)
Concerns around GP prescription of opioids may be particularly heightened due to Dr Barton’s professional background as a GP.
However, the ramifications of this particular scandal are also likely to affect public and patient perspectives on opioids and use of syringe drivers, particularly at the end-of-life, as we discuss in a linked BJGP editorial. Anecdotally, health professionals are already reporting questions arising in the wake of the recent coverage. For example, a relative on an elderly care ward recently questioned opioid prescribing, asking ‘Aren’t those the drugs that kill people, from the news?’, and when emphasising the need to move to comfort care ‘But how do you know that those painkillers are what they need: they aren’t talking?’ Through some careful communication and use of terminology, and offering a second opinion, it was possible to reassure these relatives and build their trust, but this has already demonstrated how clinicians could be finding themselves in sticky situations in the wake of Gosport.
Concerns around GP prescription of opioids may be particularly heightened due to Dr Barton’s professional background as a GP, so it is important that GPs are equipped to answer questions in a clear and honest way. Here we list some possible questions with responses framed in patient-friendly language, which we hope will help to provide some practical tips for GPs faced with these concerns.
1) What are opioids and are there any alternatives?
Opioids are chemicals which reduce the sensation of pain.
They are present naturally in the body whether or not we are experiencing pain.
The main prescribed strong opioids are morphine and diamorphine, which originate from the poppy plant.
The body changes diamorphine into morphine and then changes morphine into an active form that works to control pain.
There are synthetic versions of morphine, such as oxycodone and fentanyl, which act in slightly different ways, but are all strong opioids.
Codeine, dihydrocodeine and tramadol are known as weak opioids: they are mostly converted into morphine or related compounds in the body.
Most causes of pain will respond to morphine and related strong opioids.
There are not any effective alternatives to opioids for severe pain in most situations.
There are other medications which work on other types of pain, such as nerve pain.
Opioids are also sometimes used in low doses to treat breathlessness.
2) Are opioids effective for other symptoms such as agitation?
In short, no!
Symptoms other than pain and breathlessness in advanced disease and at the end of life are not effectively treated with opioids.
We always try to control symptoms with non-drug measures where possible, but when drugs are needed:
anxiety responds best to drugs such as midazolam.
confusion respond best to drugs such as haloperidol or levomepromazine.
If there is suspicion that agitation is being caused by undiagnosed pain, then a trial of a one-off opioid dose may be appropriate.
However if opioids are being used in the absence of pain or breathlessness, this should be questioned.
3) Do opioids hasten death, prevent recovery or cause addiction?
Research has clearly shown that when opioids are used in appropriate doses to control pain, they do not decrease survival. (2)
When used in the pain control setting, patients do not get a “high” when using opioids, as occurs when they are used in substance abuse.
Research has also shown that when used correctly, should the pain subsequently ease then the opioid dose can be gradually reduced or stopped, meaning that they do not cause addiction or prevent recovery. (2)
If used in the absence of pain, or in excessive doses that are not in proportion to the level of pain, opioids may shorten life. This is what happened in Gosport.
4) What are the side-effects of opioids and how can I know if too much opioid has been given?
Side-effects are unwanted effects of a drug and do not indicate that an excessive dose has been given. Three common opioid side-effects are:
Constipation: most patients need a laxative.
Feeling / being sick: this occurs in about a third of patients, often settles within a few days and is usually well controlled by haloperidol.
Mental clouding: some people feel that they “cannot think straight” for a few days after starting opioids, but this usually settles within three days. If it does not settle, it is common to switch to the alternative opioid oxycodone and / or ask for specialist advice.
Toxicity occurs when someone is given too much opioid.
Pointers to “opioid toxicity” include: muscle twitching, confusion, hallucinations, drowsiness, pinpoint pupils and reduced rate of breathing.
It is the reduced breathing that increases the risk of death in major overdose.
When someone has evidence of toxicity, the dose of opioid must be reduced even if they are still in pain and alternative ways of controlling the pain must be found. Advice from a palliative care specialist is commonly needed.
5) Aren’t syringe drivers dangerous?
The NHS now only uses modern syringe drivers, not the Graseby ones that were used at Gosport and later withdrawn for safety reasons.
A syringe driver gradually empties the contents of a syringe into the patient over 24 hours, given into the tissues under the skin, not into a vein.
They are particularly useful when a patient is no longer able to take medicines by mouth: they avoid the need for painful repeated injections and ensure a steady level of medication in the body.
The drugs prescribed for syringe driver need to be carefully chosen to be the right ones, in the right dose for the symptom(s) that the patient is experiencing, as already described.
In Gosport, excessive doses of opioids, usually diamorphine, were given to patients via syringe drivers who often had little or no pain. This was unacceptable practice and shortened the lives of many patients.
6) How do you know if someone is in pain if they aren’t conscious?
At this stage of illness, pain can be flagged by distressed facial expressions, clutching of a part of the body, groaning, distress on being moved or examined and agitation.
This needs skilled assessment by doctors and nurses. These flags can indicate pain, but may also indicate other problems such as a full bladder needing a catheter or agitation not due to pain.
It is helpful for family members to look out for these things and tell the doctors and nurses that they are happening.

A BJGP Christmas Carol: Part Two
Posted by BJGP Life | 18 Dec 2018 | Stories | 0
Peter Aird is a GP in Bridgwater, Somerset.
This is part two of a five part series. If you can’t wait and like to binge read then you can download the full five part version for free as an epub or mobi file for use with your Kindle or other e-reader.
Stave Two – in which Scrooge fondly remembers
Dr Scrooge woke in a cold sweat and sat bolt upright in his bed. This was not unusual for, in recent weeks, the stress associated with an impending visit by the CQC had frequently disturbed his sleep. Moments later, however, his thoughts were diverted from the need to get on and write those mandatory protocols on the secure overnight storage of hand towels and the safe use of the stairs, when, at one o’clock precisely, his bedroom door creaked open and a strange looking fellow crept into the room. Over a woollen cardigan he wore a tweed jacket complete with leather patches on the elbows; on the end of his nose was perched a pair of pince nez glasses; and in his hand he carried a battered black Gladstone bag.
‘Are you the spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold me?’ asked Scrooge.
‘Indeed I am,’ the apparition replied, ‘I am the Ghost of General Practice Past. I’ve come straight from a meeting of my celestial Balint Group. And my, what catharsis we enjoyed there this evening. Your former partner, Jacob, was in attendance. He’s a good chap, a jolly fine fellow. But enough of that. Come along with me – he has sent me to show you what General Practice once was.’
The spirit held out his hand and Scrooge instinctively took it. As he did so, Scrooge felt himself being lifted, as if weightless, from his bed. The spirit led him to, and then through, the wall of the bedroom and out into the night air. They journeyed until they found themselves in the oak-panelled surroundings of what appeared to be a gentleman’s club. A number of elderly men sat together in high-backed leather chairs. All were doctors, enjoying a glass of port after a drug sponsored Christmas meal. With them was a medical student who was attached to one of their number.
‘Listen to these chaps,’ the spirit said to Ebenezer, ‘Each and every one is a fine fellow – a jolly good chap. You could learn a thing or two from what decent sorts like these have to say.’
The men were taking it in turns in regaling the medical student with tales of their working life.
‘Of course, these days, the youngsters have it easy. They only work a mere seventy-two hours a week you know. In my day it was eighty-one’
‘Eighty-one hours? You had it easy. It was all internal cover when I did my house jobs. In real terms, I did a hundred hours a week.’
‘Only a hundred hours a week? Luxury. I was running a GP practice single handedly by the time I was 23… On call every hour of every day.’
‘That’s right. We had it tough as GPs. One hundred and sixty-eight hours a week we worked – and, of course, we had to provide all the obstetric care – home deliveries every day.’
‘And most of those were c-sections – we had do the operations with only kitchen utensils for surgical instruments and a bottle of brandy for an anaesthetic.’
‘Aye – and if you tell that to the medical students of today, they’ll not believe you.’
The spirit indicated that it was time to move on and Ebenezer readily agreed. He’d heard it all before. The walls of the room blurred and faded and gradually, as things came back into focus, Scrooge realised that they were now high above rolling hills. Passing over snow-covered fields and lanes, they travelled until they came at last to a small town and stopped by a house that Scrooge recognised as his childhood home. Outside the dwelling, a car pulled up. The familiar figure of his family GP clambered out of the vehicle and made her way up the garden path to the front door. A woman was waiting anxiously for her arrival. They exchanged a warm greeting after which the woman led the doctor up the stairs to a room in which a boy lay, pale and in obvious distress.
‘Thank you for coming doctor, I know you’re busy but I didn’t know what to do. Ebenezer’s usually such a healthy child but he seems now to be struggling with his breathing.’
‘It’s no trouble Mrs Scrooge – let’s take a look at him.’
The doctor knelt down by the bedside and smiled at the boy who managed to smile back. Ebenezer liked the doctor. He’d visited her a number of times over the years but this was the first time she’d ever visited him. The doctor asked a few questions and then carefully examined the boy, paying particularly careful attention to his chest. When she was done, she turned back to his mother and gave her the diagnosis.
‘I’m afraid it looks like we’ve a case of pneumonia on our hands. He’s really quite poorly and will be needing the help of my colleagues at the hospital. We best get him there as soon as possible.’
Scrooge looked on and wondered how she could say such a thing without a computer and a pulse oximeter to enable her to assess the risk of sepsis. She hadn’t appeared to even consider a CURB-65 score. None the less, a few phone calls were made and the doctor, placing her hand on Mrs Scrooge’s shoulder as if to say that everything would be alright, made her goodbyes, having given an assurance that an ambulance would soon arrive, an expectation Scrooge thought fanciful in the extreme.
‘Do you remember that day Ebenezer?’ asked the Ghost of General Practice Past.
‘I do,’ Ebenezer whispered, taken aback at how emotional he was now feeling. The spirit smiled to himself as he sensed that Scrooge was close to tears. He loved catharsis – catharsis was good.
‘She was such a lovely doctor’, Scrooge continued. ‘Always so kind and reassuring. She’d become almost a part of the family having visited so frequently during the last days of my father’s final illness. She always seemed to have time. It was because of her that I decided to become a doctor. The way she practised medicine caused me to realised that being a doctor was a wonderful job to have. She seemed to me to be a fortunate woman.’
‘A fortunate woman indeed,’ agreed the spirit. ‘A fortunate women and…’ he paused, thrown for a moment, ‘…a good chap.’ The spirit hesitated again and then added, as if to try and reassure himself, ‘She was a jolly fine fellow.’
With that the ghost again took Scrooge’s hand and soon they were once more travelling through the night sky. On and on they flew, until they came to a village hall decorated brightly with all manner of coloured lights. A Christmas tree strewn with tinsel and still more lights stood by the entrance. Inside, Scrooge recognised the staff of his GP training practice. Some talked, others laughed and a number danced enthusiastically to music provided by a band. All were clearly enjoying the opportunity to relax and have fun together. A portly man then stood up and called for a bit of hush. It was Dr Fezziwig, the senior partner of the practice and Ebenezer’s one time trainer.
‘A moment’s silence if you please everybody. If I might say a few words, thank you all so much for coming this evening. I hope you’re having a good time.’ He paused a moment and then, with a feigned suggestion of doubt in his voice, questioned the crowd, ‘You are having a good time, aren’t you?’
Those gathered gave the desired response with cheers and roars that left nobody in any doubt that indeed they were. Fezziwig continued. ‘I want to thank you all for your help this past year. The partners appreciate your hard work, doing what can be a very difficult job. We couldn’t manage without you.’ More cheers followed together with a few calls for a pay rise. Fezziwig then concluded by wishing everyone a very Merry Christmas and insisting that everyone took advantage of the free bar that he and the partners were glad to provide. ‘Only keep an eye on young Dr Scrooge. He’s a fine young doctor but Ebenezer’s not as experienced as we older GPs and I’m not sure he can take his drink! We don’t want a repeat of last month’s incident when he woke up naked on the delicatessen counter at Sainsbury’s!’
‘Now he does seem like a good chap – a jolly fine fellow,’ declared the spirit, beaming as if the natural order had been restored to where chaos had once threatened to reign. ‘He’s a good, fine, decent, jolly chap of a fellowy sort if ever I saw one.’
The Ghost of General Practice Past turned to Scrooge and looked him straight in the eye. ‘But what of him?’ the spirit asked drawing his companion’s attention to a young man who was accepting the gentle ribbing at the hands of the senior colleague he respected so highly. He was sat laughing alongside various members of staff with whom he was sharing a table.
‘I was so happy then,’ Scrooge told the ghost. ‘He was such a wise man and so willing to share what he had learnt. And we were such a great team, all so eager to support one another. Back then, there seemed to be so much more time. Why did everything change? And how did I become so resentful of the job I used to love?’
‘Something certainly changed – something that shouldn’t have,’ replied the ghost. ‘At least, not in the way it has. Perhaps something needs to change again. Perhaps something needs to be recovered. But it is for you to decide what and how. As for me, my time is up. We must return. You have other guests to welcome tonight.’
And in less time than it takes for EMIS to crash on a busy Monday morning, Scrooge was back in his room, alone with his thoughts. It was nearly two in the morning.

BJGP Long Read: A valedictory note on my retirement
Posted by BJGP Life | 21 Feb 2020 | BJGP Long Read | 18
Claire Stillman is a recently retired GP who spent 30 years in Scottish general practice, the last 20 of which were in Glasgow.
About eight months ago I wrote an emotional, angry rant about why I was leaving general practice. It was in response to a questionnaire from the LMC asking me for reasons why I was going. I never sent it to them; it seemed enough to write everything down and it exhausted my anger. I kept meaning to go back to it but I never did, probably because it was too upsetting when I was in work and then it became irrelevant when I left. My emotion had been expended. Also, I felt that I had said nothing new. There were no blinding insights, other people had said the same things over and over and nothing had changed. It is hard to see how anything can change given the current structure and funding of the NHS. I should say that I took early retirement at the age of 59 following 30 years in General Practice and I might have taken a handful of days of sick leave in that time. I never took any time off for stress.
Here are the reasons I left, or perhaps some of them:
Appointments
The appointment system is not fit for purpose. A GP has to be all things to all people in 10 minutes only and this is untenable. In this time we have to deal with the polypharmacised multiply morbid patient who has several problems to discuss. We have to manage an increasing amount of clinical work transferred from secondary to primary care. We have to deal with the manipulative, the dangerous and the deluded. We have to deal with those with shopping lists of demands, the worried well, those sent by third parties for proof of just about anything. We have to deal with the longwinded, the demented, the unhappy, the angry. We have to deal with the worried parent and the sick child. We have to deal with the medical emergency or those who think it is an emergency. The list goes on. We are accessible to everyone, every single being has the right to walk in to discuss anything; there is no filter, no prior discussion to see whether a trip to a GP is appropriate or suitable.
We pay an emotional price for constant availability for everything the world throws at us.
GPs can be bullied and manipulated by a public who increasingly demand certainty and rights and a bureaucracy that seeks to medicalise social problems. In all this we have no support. We were trained to help others’ suffering, not manage our own. We pay an emotional price for constant availability for everything the world throws at us (and I mean everything), and a professionalism that is never acknowledged or meaningfully supported. We face the relentless expectations of the ten minute appointment, the constantly full waiting rooms, the unacceptable waiting times to be seen and feel constantly punished because we cannot meet them. I can honestly say that in all my time as a GP principle, I can count on one hand the times I did not have a fully booked surgery. Government policy, patient expectation, pressure on our staff mean that we are constantly in the wrong, on the back foot, for not delivering a service that, quite frankly, is impossible to provide. We are supposed to be made of teflon, have no feelings, cope with the relentless daily, monthly, yearly pressure of not delivering the impossibly perfect service that this society believes is their right.
Patient expectations
Expectations by patients have changed over my thirty years in practice. Society has changed; the consumer approach, the belief that everything should have an answer, the inability to accept the uncertainty of life and health; the belief that if something goes wrong someone must be to blame have all increased over time. Expectations increasingly fuelled by the unrealistic claims made on the internet. Also the idea that everyone should have instant access, instant answers, has grown. These expectations are not really compatible with what GPs do, namely manage uncertainty. Because of this GPs have been harried into increasing amounts of patient tests, often with no clear goal in mind and no evidence that it would be useful. On the contrary, tests breed insecurity and more tests, because doctors feel the need to cover themselves, to insure themselves against patients demanding ever more certainty. It is ironic that in an age when the population has never been more healthy or long lived, health uncertainty and anxiety increases. Adding to patient expectations is the medicalisation of human sadness. The belief that a doctor can make grief, sadness, the ordinary difficulties of life better with a pill or therapy seems to have increased steadily over the years.
Lack of resources
Mental health services were reason enough to leave general practice.
GPs are damned if they do and damned if they don’t. We are placed in impossible double binds by chronic NHS underfunding and then blamed for the outcomes. Classic examples are the exploitation of our gate keeping roles by saying we must refer less into secondary care and then blaming us for not diagnosing enough cancers. We are held responsible for not diagnosing the rarest of cancers, which have no characteristic sets of symptoms, and yet demonised or refused by secondary care if we refer patients like these in.
Mental health services were reason enough to leave general practice. The NHS in my area refused to fund or possibly organise an even half functioning service and given society’s propensity for medicalising any adverse human experience we were imprisoned in the ultimate double bind and for us it was a life sentence. Throughout my entire career I was supposed to deal with the mentally distressed in ten minute appointments with no credible back up. The media slammed us for handing out too many antidepressants giving the impression that we had any alternatives. Trust me, we did not. The stark choices for GPs dealing with mental distress ranging from overt psychosis to a little sadness were a prescription for a pill then and there and a bit more than ten minutes (thereby pressurising everyone else in the waiting room), or a referral for a mental health treatment, be it talking therapy or more assessment which might occur within the next 3 to 6 months. The icing on the cake was that despite a GP referral, the mental health service might decide, several weeks later, not to offer any treatment at all. Truly GPs backs are up against the wall when dealing with mental health problems, which on a conservative estimate, take up to 20% of their work. Indeed, there is a psychological component to all disease. Dealing with mental health services throughout my career was the most excruciating and depressing aspect of my job.
Another problem caused by underfunding, which inexorably worsened throughout my time in practice, was waiting times. This has caused the NHS to become cruel in its dealing with suffering patients. I have seen people with severe, debilitating, painful conditions having to wait up to a year to be seen in secondary care. And then they get sent for tests, have to wait months for their results, and then they have to wait further months for follow up in clinics to get the results of said tests. Hospital doctors never make decisions without panels of tests that seem to grow larger by the year. Meanwhile the GP is the only doctor a patient can directly access while waiting for all these events, the walls are very high around secondary care, and we are expected to manage their pain, anxiety and frustration with no power to change anything. As usual, there is no support for the GP managing the patient in this vacuum and the more compassionate the GP, the more likely they are to be broken by this powerlessness in the face of suffering.
Complexity
Patients are becoming increasingly complex. They live longer, are on more medication and often have two, three or even more co-existing conditions. We are expected to deal with their needs in ten minutes, or consider their problems in the little time we have between fire-fighting paperwork and results and managing the practice. Meanwhile secondary care is becoming more specialised with increasing numbers of silos. A patient goes to a hospital clinic where a specialist has the luxury of dealing with one condition only, with all the back up of a hospital department. And it can happen that the decision a specialist makes about the one condition that is their remit will have a knock on effect for the other conditions a patient might have. It is left to the GP to sort it out. A record achieved by one of my patients was that he visited seven different specialties on a regular basis, all of which dealt with one aspect of his care and none of which could come up with an overarching explanation for his symptoms. Needless to say I had ten minutes to deal with all of them. The use of protocols, guidelines and non-doctor vetting of secondary care referrals also lead to GP stress, not to say cruelty to the patient. The silos are getting narrower, secondary care clinicians are more and more empowered to say what they will not deal with . Meanwhile GPs have to deal with their rejections with no support for their suffering patients.
Polypharmacy
This is a real problem in the ten minute appointment. All evidence based medicine derives from studies on single conditions and all medication guidelines come from them. The problem is that very few patients have only one condition. The GP has to juggle co-prescribed medications with their multiplicity of interactions and side effects in each individual, very difficult in a busy surgery with a waiting room full of patients expecting to be seen on time. Ironically when the community pharmacists started to be involved in the Scottish NHS new contract, they stated they would need thirty minutes per patient. And a pharmacist would only be dealing with medications while the GP has to deal with the actual patient’s agenda, which may be something else entirely. Prescribing outwith the consultation has also become more onerous over the last few years as drug shortages and the increasing prescribing demands of secondary care have to be managed.
Poorly understood conditions/somatisation/chronic pain
Some of the hardest patients to deal with, the most time consuming and emotionally draining, are the ones that don’t fit into neat diagnostic boxes, yet constantly present with suffering and demand answers. These patients are not recognised by, and certainly not treated by secondary care. For example, those people with chronic pain for which we actually have no effective medication. Synthetic opiates, the only treatment out there, do not work and turn them into addicts. Any attempts at psychological reframing of their conditions are seriously resisted by the patients, and to be frank, the medical establishment.
There seems to be a belief that GP is elastic can continuously absorb extra work indefinitely.
The Cartesian dualism that bedevils our concepts of illness means that patients and many doctors think that the ultimate insult is to suggest that their suffering is ‘all in their head’ and for some strange reason does not then exist. Unfortunately GPs are faced with a number of patients who manifest their life distress with physical symptoms, call it somatisation for want of a better term, for whom existing medicine has no treatment and who become bitterly entrenched in their illness behaviour as they feel less and less cared for. The ‘fibromyalgics’, the chronically fatigued, for whom there is no realistic therapy and for which GPs have no training or support. I am not surprised that so many of them turn to snake oil salesman and quacks who at least provide them with attention before exploiting their vulnerabilities.
Outsourcing of secondary care work
Over the years, general practice has been subjected to a form of ‘mission creep’ with secondary care demanding that we increasingly do work that was originally done in hospital medicine. While it may seem reasonable that GPs manage new atrial fibrillation or perform near patient testing, this is added to our already increasing workload. There seems to be a belief that GP is elastic can continuously absorb extra work indefinitely. There is only so much work that we can take before we break.
Housebound patients
While home visit rates have gone down, housebound patients are becoming increasingly complex so that visits can resemble ward rounds in a geriatric hospital. Patients are often on medications and have conditions that need frequent monitoring and repeat visits that we are not resourced to manage. Latterly, I became increasingly concerned about our cohort of usually elderly, frail housebound patients on complex, potentially dangerous treatment regimes who were poorly managed in the community. General practice as it stands is just not equipped to deal with these people.
Conclusion
I think the chief thing to emphasise is that GPs stand alone, and are chronically under resourced. We may work in group practices and have our administration staff, but once the door is closed, it is just the GP and the patient in the room together. And in real time we have no support, indeed we have no formal support networks at all on the ground. There is no-one to catch us as we fall, we have no protection from the ire of the public, anger that is usually caused by a system that fails to deliver what has been promised. We stand and fall by the decisions we make in ten minutes and if things go wrong, the full weight of public and professional opprobrium lands on our heads. There is no safety net, no cavalry coming over the hill to relieve us.
Now, I have retired and I do not miss any of it. I was well thought of by my patients and staff to judge by the feedback I have received over the years and the overwhelming number of cards and presents I received when I retired. I also got on with and liked my partners. Yet a powerful emotion I associate with my time in general practice was one of failure. I had failed to deliver a good service and so now I am just relieved to be free of it. However, what does bother me is that I had a wealth of knowledge and skills, accumulated over lifetime, which I will never use again.
Yet there is no place for me now in my profession, general practice has lost my skills and those of all my retired peers completely.
And what does strike me is that perhaps my profession could benefit from my and my peers’ experience. I could perhaps mentor younger GPs, newly practising partners, and provide them with the support I never had. I can read a face, interpret its subtle movements, be aware of another’s suffering. I can listen actively and frame peoples’ stories empathetically and positively. I can pull out the essential points in a narrative, summarise a conversation, help someone form a plan for the future. I can listen. Yet there is no place for me now in my profession, general practice has lost my skills and those of all my retired peers completely. I feel that this is a shame as we are a resource that could be utilised for the good of the profession.
As for the future of general practice, I do not trust the Scottish NHS and the health boards to deliver the supposed new Scottish GP contract. They mouth platitudes but follow their own agendas rather than those of general practice, they have not trusted GPs to execute the changes and allocated funds seem to have dissipated in a plethora of talking shops and committees. It seems that the further you remove practitioners, the people who actually do the work, from decisions about how the work is done, the less successful the outcome. Unfortunately, GPs have been so busy actually doing their jobs, they have not had the time or emotional energy to fight for a new contract that works for them. I have little hope that the new contract will result in better experiences for patients or their doctors.
However, it can be argued that innovation, out of the box thinking comes from those without an interest in the system, so let’s throw the problem of how to run an NHS out there. Let all and sundry chew on it, because I don’t expect those within the system to come up with any answers. Lets hope someone has thought of something before the inevitable happens to me and I become a patient.

Thank you so very much for putting my sentiments down in such an eloquent way. I left my partnership in Glasgow recently aged 55 for the reasons you have outilined. I waited for the new contract and knew it was inadequate and resigned my partnership.
“the more compassionate the GP, the more likely they are to be broken by this powerlessness in the face of suffering”- this especially very much summed up my experience.
I now locum and feel more protected and distanced from the toxic work conditions expected of me by myself, patients, the NHS and the SG. I feel my experience of 30years as a doctor is wasted and I just have to suck it up and not dwell on it. That’s life! A shame when there is so much capacity of compassion and skill to give to people, given the right conditions.

Hi, given the current situation, perhaps we should view Active GP as something that you do for a finite time only, as part of a “portfolio career “ not a whole working lifetime. Rather you spend sometime at the frontline, then move onto less stressful jobs having done your bit. The question would be what to move on to that we have the skills and training for, apart from locum work. Also I think most people would agree that the more experienced the doctor the better practitioner they are. Always remembering that experience can just mean making the same mistakes with increasing confidence!

I also took early retirement from GP Partnership at 56 and have not regretted it. As I walked out of my surgery for the last time I almost literally felt a weight lifted from my shoulders. I share the author’s regret that I can’t continue to use the wisdom and experience gained over 30 years to help patients and relieve some of the burden from my younger colleagues.

Wow. Thank you for a brilliant, honest piece. I’m relatively early in my GP career and I recognise ALL of what you say. At the moment, the good outweighs the bad for me in GP, but I do wonder if I have the resilience to stay the distance. The lesson for me is: look after yourself and each other, because everyone else will milk you as dry as you let them.
I have saved this article for future reference and sharing. Thank you again.

I also took early retirement at 59 now nearly 7 years ago. This article describes my feelings too (OK in England not Scotland). I feel too that stopping work lifted a burden from me and regret at never being able to do the job to the best of my ability due to constant time pressure. The skills I gained in listening to my patients for over 30 years are no longer available to the NHS, as new less experienced doctors are assumed to be of equal value to the NHS. Bums on seats can be counted and that’s what appears to matter to those counting and making the rules.

Thanks for all your comments. Perhaps the RCGP should consider the mentoring idea! I refer to the comment I made above about limited stints at the front line. Sadly, in Scotland there is a shortage of new GPS and practices have had to shut up shop because of this. Clare

Clair, your comments eloquently outline the challenges and unreasonable demands placed on GP’s and 5 years ago I faced the same dilemma in my English practice of 30 years, and at 58 I too decided it was time to leave. I then decided to tackle a different challenge and moved to a much smaller remote and rural practice in the Hebrides as an NHS salaried partner. Surgeries and lists became smaller and I now have the luxury of time to spend with the patients and have the support of fabulous community staff. The experience and knowledge I’ve accumulated has been well used and I’ve truly enjoyed this final phase of my medical career, and I’m still working here
5 years later!
We are privileged to have the job we do, but time pressures can certainly prevent us giving our patients the service they deserve.

What a brilliantly written article. Comprehensively details why GP is failing and will likely not exist, at least in its current format, in the next 10-15 years. GP is the Walmart of medicine, pile them in, stack them high – all you can fit, anything and everything in a 10min appt. It is popular with politicians as they need cheap medicine by GPs to subsidise the expensive specialists and keep the tax payers happy with lower tax rates.
Unfortunately the real world is not like the Dr Who Tardis and time does not expand. GPs are human and to remain humane, we need to self care to avoid burnout. For some it will be time to boundary patients, for others it will be time to cut back on sessions and and for many it is time to look for alternative careers. I used to look at GPs as a child in the 1980s with deep respect and awe, they had status and commanded respect from their peers. These times no longer exist. Now each day is a battle for many if not most. I left the NHS year ago and will not return, I wish those of you who remain the best.

This has been one of the best short reads describing what GP life has become and I can’t disagree with any of it. Strange thing is, like the Gp reply above, who moved to a small rural practice , and enjoying his last 5 years, I too have honestly rarely ever had a bad day in my 30 years as a GP partner now aged 58 Wales. Small personalised list 2750 (weighted list 3500) in a 2 person (1.5fte) so 4 day week. The single biggest reason I remain happy and peaceful in the midst of the plethora of issues you so eloquently describe is for me they all become so much milder/manageable/solvable when there is someone who armed with a life time knowledge of their small 1300-1500 patients characters, expectations and illnesses, finds decisions and tests ,mail and the whole lot becomes quicker easier, more thorough.Its not that I am not busy ,it’s just not always busy. It’s not that I am better as I am not.
From what I see and hear in the profession generally, I can’t see a sustainable way forward for Primary care unless we rapidly move to personalised lists, yes in group partnerships supported by HCSW/Nurses/PA/admin . I mean where you are solely responsible for your own patients, not someone else’s,not strangers,not patients who try and manipulate new GPs. Yes seek 2nd opinions occasionally, Expect yes a day off each week where similar partner /colleagues cover any emergencies.No long waits to be seen . Telephone first less necessary, “Rubbish“ I hear some think,but I maintain it is all very possible because my experience is the time saving and in depth supervision by one GP of an almost totally “known” population really does yield the time and space to let us cope,grow and even thrive.
Most complex illnesses become less stressful as you have been with them through it all and know them almost as well as they do. Your previous consultation laid out the actions you would do if they returned. Ten minutes often plenty bar the first new complex illness, no more long history taking by talented GPs who have little knowledge of the patient multiplied a thousand times a year .Less mental stress and clinician anxiety.
Add in HCSW, social Prescribing and decent mental health services and it become a real pleasure and something even at 58 I don’t wish to give up.
Planning 2 days a week till 65.
You asked for a solution. There it is. Not meant to be Patronising. Personalised lists where you and only you ,95% of the time have to make the decisions that will affect your workplace tomorrow and next week Is the way ahead. .Claire, please don’t stay away, seek a small practice as you are incredibly valuable. As for me I am planning 2 days a week till 65.

I am a 50 year old GP working in North West England. I could not agree more with everything that is written in this article. I am a very robust individual and continue to work as a Partner in a large practice with great colleagues. However I have seen many very good people “broken” (alcoholism, Depression, burn out) by the toxic environment of General Practice.Good UK GPs are some of the finest and hard working General Physicians in the world. In the last 10 years I have come to the conclusion that the NHS is not fit for purpose in the current world and never will be. The sooner the NHS becomes a private insurance based service then the sooner GPs will be able to control their workload / quality of care and lead a full rewarding working life that does not “break them”.

Clair, what a beautifully written article.
Thank you.
Last year I initiated the project “Rediscover the Joy of General Practice” https://www.srmc.scot.nhs.uk/joy-project/
It is specifically designed for GPs like you coming up for retirement but who feel they have more to give, but not under the pressures you describe.
It began as a collaboration between NHS Orkney, Shetland, Western Isles and Highland and this year has expanded to include other Scottish Health Boards.
It is based on work undertaken in Orkney over the last 10 years.
We offer contracts of between 6-18+ weeks/year to undertake practice attachments for periods of 1-4 weeks at a time. Travel from a Scottish city and accommodation is paid for, meaning that GPs do not need to relocate.
Our philosophy is based on supporting the practices and staff in all aspects of GP work and quality improvement.
Have a look at the website to understand the scheme more fully.
In 2019 we recruited 33 GPs to our Rural GP Support Team, many were retiring GPs who have felt reinvigorated by working with us.
This year we have expanded the scheme to involve the whole of Scotland and not just rural practices.
Currently we have shortlisted a further 35 GPs.
Although we have officially closed, we will still accept late applications and will reopen to applications again once we have established this second team.
What is interesting is that as our team expands and develops we suddenly find that we have the opportunity to consider how we can tackle what previously seemed intractable problems.
All members of the team are encouraged to contribute their ideas of how we could tackle thorny issues and due to the phenomenal depth of experience and expertise among our GPs we find ourselves in an unusually empowered position.
The project is led by the Primary Care Associate Medical Directors and Managers from the participating Health Boards and has the full backing of the Scottish Government.
We are at an early stage and certainly do not have all the answers, but we are determined to try and make a difference.
Working together with vision, determination and lateral thinking I believe we can make real changes – however, I am a self-confessed irresponsible optimist!
Anyone interested, do have a look at the website and please feel free to join us.
Claire, I would very much like to have a chat with you and to explore some of your ideas.

Posted by Peter Aird | 19 Aug 2019 | Opinion | 1
Peter Aird is a GP in Bridgwater, Somerset.
There’s a scene in Stan and Ollie, the film about Laurel and Hardy when towards the end of the film, Hardy says to Laurel: “I’ll miss this when we’re gone”. He speaks the words, indicating his eagerness to finish the show with the dance routine that, due to his heart disease, he knows, from a solely medical point of view, he is unwise to perform.
Oliver Hardy knows it’s not just his career with Stan Laurel that is drawing to a close – it’s also his life. What he chooses to do though is not simply based upon the notion that one should live only for the moment. Mindful of the future, the sadness he will feel, and recalling the past, the joy he has known, he makes a decision in the present. Hoping not to be left with the sadness of regret – he dances.
It’s a bittersweet moment. The sadness is extenuated by the joy, the joy extenuated by the sadness. It made me smile – as I cried.
It reminded me of four things:
1. Good advice is sometimes best ignored
There are some things more important than one’s health – the value of a life is not measured by its length. In our efforts to extend life we must not deprive our patients the opportunity to live. Sometimes we need to say to our patients that they’d be well advised to pay no heed to what we doctors tell them. And we sometimes have to be wise enough to ignore conventional medical wisdom and deliberately fail to pass it on.
2. The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.
Following guidelines may make us all feel safer, they risk leaving us trapped in a very small corner of the here and now.
Neither we, nor our patients, need yet more guidelines focusing in on every symptom that is experienced with the demand that each is managed perfectly. Though following guidelines may make us all feel safer, they risk leaving us trapped in a very small corner of the here and now. Too much attention to problems can give them undue prominence in our consciousness and risks diminishing our lives more than is necessary. This is even more true when the problems are only risk factors – that is, merely potential problems. Similarly, neither we nor our patients need any more spurious health scares. Though, as a consequence, undertaking a precipitous and wholesale change to our medical practice may give us a momentary sense of satisfaction that current advice is being followed, we will be left too busy to alter the things that genuinely matter today and thus delay any movement towards a truly better tomorrow. We need to keep in mind the bigger picture and focus on what’s most important. Colluding with patients that with the right combination of pills and careful attention to lifestyle death will be avoided is dishonest and, as Oliver Hardy perhaps understood, detrimental to all our chances of enjoying the life we have now.
3. Contradictory emotions can be experienced simultaneously
We can not deny the existence of sadness – on the contrary its inevitability is universal. Furthermore, we cannot know what happiness really is without knowing the pain of sorrow – and sorrow requires the memory of the temporary nature of happiness. If, then, we are to be happy, it must be alongside our sadness. We dare not wait for the absence of sorrow before allowing ourselves to be happy. It is not that we can not be happy because we know sadness, nor that we can not be sad because there are things to be happy about. Paradoxically, we can be happy and sad at the same time. Life isn’t merely about being happy. We can smile – even as we cry.
Similarly we can have a healthy appreciation of life despite serious ill health. We can live well, maybe even dance, despite our approaching death. Life is not black or white, it’s a kaleidoscope of grey. We would do well to see the light in the darkness.
4. We need hope.
Medicine must stop trying to be the solution to the problems for which it is not the answer.
Unlike Oliver Hardy, too many people won’t miss this life when they’re gone. Merely keeping people alive and healthy shouldn’t be our sole concern. Nobody for whom the highlight of their day is a bottle of scotch, a packet of fags and a fried chicken meal will adopt healthy lifestyles no matter how much we bully them to do so. We need to consider the future rather than be obsessed with the present. Such patients need to be given the hope of better lives – lives that will be missed – lives which might just motivate the healthy living that will enable such lives to be more fully enjoyed.
Rather than offering answers that won’t work, and adding to the futility that all too many experience, medicine must stop trying to be the solution to the problems for which it is not the answer. Being encouraged to constantly look inward at ourselves is the opposite to what is needed if we are to enjoy the fulfilled lives we hope we’ll live. More than a fourth antihypertensive or a third line statin, to be happy we need to be valued as members of local communities, undertake worthwhile work and enjoy meaningful connections with others. We need to know what it is to love and be loved. That is all of society’s responsibility, and though that too may be a vain hope, I for sure need one that’s even better still, it is at least preferable than hoping solely in ourselves.
At work, to keeps us going in hard times, we need also the hope that our practices will continue to be communities which provide such opportunities. They need to remain small enough to allow relationships between both staff and patients to develop over time in ways that just aren’t possible in large anonymous organisations. Staying reasonably small enables us to notice and appreciate others even as we are noticed and appreciated ourselves. Lose this and we will find we have gotten ourselves into another nice mess. And so, for as long as I am privileged to be able to continue to practice in the way I do now, in a supportive partnership looking after personal lists, I’m not looking to leave or reduce my commitments any time soon.
Because, I guess, ‘I’ll miss this when we’re gone’
Now if only I could dance.

Peter – you have encapsulated the last 40 years of my own thoughts in this brilliant post!
Quote of the year: “Nobody for whom the highlight of their day is a bottle of scotch, a packet of fags and a fried chicken meal will adopt healthy lifestyles no matter how much we bully them to do so. ”

Paramedics in general practice: what can we expect?
Posted by BJGP Life | 23 Feb 2018 | Bright Ideas and Innovation, Clinical | 0
Kamal R. Mahtani, Georgette Eaton, Matthew Catterall and Alice Ridley highlight the potential roles for paramedics in general practice.
The NHS enters its 70th year with the general practice workforce in crisis. The promise of 5000
more GPs is a distant pipedream and as clinical demand increases, the number of full-time equivalent GPs continues to fall. New strategies are desperately needed to tackle these problems. The NHS England GP Forward View advocates investing and developing new models of care. This includes expansion of a multidisciplinary and more integrated primary care team. These recommendations reflect the findings of the Primary Care Workforce Commission, who highlighted potential roles for paramedics, clinical pharmacists, and physician associates, all substituting into current GP care pathways.
The generalist skill mix of the modern day paramedic graduate creates possibilities for them to work in a range of domains.
Paramedics already have a track record in providing flexible and innovative ways of delivering extended clinical care. This is partly because of the expectation that a UK paramedic can give generalist care as an autonomous allied healthcare professional. The College of Paramedics, which acts as the professional body, defines the expected competencies from a paramedic graduate as
“an autonomous practitioner who has the knowledge, skills and clinical expertise to assess, treat, diagnose, supply and administer medicines, manage, discharge and refer patients in a range of urgent, emergency, critical or out of hospital settings”. Although some graduates go on to develop further skills, taking on Specialist, Advanced, and Consultant Paramedic roles, the generalist skill mix of the modern day paramedic graduate creates possibilities for them to work in a range of domains.
So what might general practice expect? Early review pointed to deployment of paramedics into roles that included centralised telephone triage, on-scene acute care delivery, and intermediate community care support schemes. However, there is now growing recognition that the generalist skills of the paramedic could be deployed into more widespread in-hours general practices. This may include running clinics, triaging and managing minor illnesses, and providing continuity for patients with complex health needs. Further roles may include assessment and management of requests for same-day urgent home visits, as well as regular visits to homebound patients with long-term conditions.
Specialist paramedics provided home visit support and dispensed some acute medications to community-based patients.
Such innovation requires careful evaluation. The NHS England GP Access Fund (formerly the Prime Minister’s Challenge Fund) served as a platform to test, and to some degree, evaluate how paramedics can be deployed in primary care. The first evaluation report highlighted at least four sites, among the 20 awarded funding, which piloted a range of models in primary care, working with the ambulance service and paramedics. On the South Kent Coast, specialist paramedics provided home visit support and dispensed some acute medications to community-based patients. The service reportedly saved 720 GP appointments, although details are limited. In Workington, Specialist Paramedics were deployed into A&E departments to determine whether patients could have been more appropriately treated in a Primary Care Centre.
The NHS GP Forward View and the Primary Care Workforce Commision have both recommended an increase in the number of GPs as well as the development of a multidisciplinary primary workforce. Although advocated, broader deployment of paramedics in general practices still requires careful evaluation of clinical outcomes, value, and satisfaction. Consideration should also be given to the growth of paramedics’ roles in this setting and their potential impact on ambulance services. Nevertheless, although absolute numbers remain small, between September 2016 and March 2017 the number of paramedics working in general practice has grown, increasing from 75 to 150. The NHS has also had a positive public response to proposals to introduce independent prescribing by paramedics. This may facilitate more clinical roles in general practice, a setting that is desperate for extra capacity, and integrated multidisciplinary teams of the future.

Ten tips for telephone consultations about COVID-19
Posted by BJGP Life | 19 Mar 2020 | Coronavirus | 0
This guide is written by Roger Neighbour and Simon Stockley.
Dr Roger Neighbour (OBE MA DSc FRCP FRACGP FRCGP). He qualified in 1971 from King’s College, Cambridge, and St Thomas’ Hospital, London. He is the author of The Inner Consultation (1987), The Inner Apprentice (1992), and The Inner Physician (2016).
Dr. Simon Stockley is the RCGP Clinical Champion for Sepsis, and represents the RCGP on the NHS England Cross-systems Sepsis Prevention Programme Board and the Academy of Royal Colleges Sepsis Group. A GP for 30 years, he has prepared multiple sepsis teaching and support aids for clinicians working in general practice.
This guide is an aide-memoire for clinicians conducting telephone consultations to assess and advise patients concerned they may have coronavirus.
Pre-planning
1. Choose a good time for making the calls. Calls under these circumstances can be stressful. For everyone’s sake, try not to squeeze them in at a time during the day when you are already under more than usual pressure.
Consider using a checklist of questions or a template to guide and record your conversation.
Beginning the conversation
2. Establish early on who you are talking to and what the purpose of the call is.
Are you talking to the patient, or to a relative or carer? (If it’s not the patient, remember there may be issues of confidentiality.)
You could say something like:
“Let me see if I have got this right – you are worried that you may have coronavirus? … OK, in that case I’ll need ask you for a bit more information.”
Try not to let the call sound routine or a chore. Patients are more likely to accept reassurance or follow advice if the conversation feels ‘personal’.
Information needed
3. Check where the patient is at the moment. They may not be at the address you think they are, and this could be important if they need to be seen or are acutely unwell.
4. What are the symptoms? Are they consistent with coronavirus?
Does the patient have any pre-existing conditions such as COPD or asthma that could be causing the symptoms, or that could place the patient at increased risk of deterioration?
Do they have any facilities for taking temperature, measuring pulse, peak flow, blood sugar or other relevant physiology?
5. Actively ask about specific signs of deterioration.
Is the patient able to go about their normal activities? Have they stopped doing anything they usually do? Or are they well enough to do most of their usual daily activities?
When talking, does the patient sound breathless or unable to complete sentences without pausing for breath?
Take the concerns of parents or family seriously. They are in the best position to know if a child or loved one is behaving ‘uncharacteristically unwell’, i.e. not in the way they usually do when they’re ill.
Decide if telephone management is appropriate
6. Telephone management is appropriate if, and only if:
the diagnosis is fairly clear;
the duration of illness is short (Most patients should show some improvement over a 7-day period);
there are no ‘red flags’, and the patient seems in reasonable condition, and
the caller is willing to accept reassurance and advice.
Red flag warning signs include: • Difficulty in breathing / shortness of breath • Persistent pain or pressure in the chest • Pale and clammy • New confusion or becoming difficult to rouse • Blue lips or face. • Non-blanching rash
7. Give clear advice about staying at home
Government advice for people with possible or probable COVID-19, and their families and contacts, can change significantly at short notice. Before you make calls to patients, it is worth reading and/or printing-out the latest ‘stay at home’ guidance, which can be read and downloaded from:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-people-with-confirmed-or-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection°
You could also offer to send this link to the patient by text or email.
8. Check what other medications the patient is currently taking, in case any might need to be altered or suspended during a period of fever and possible dehydration e.g. metformin, ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, diuretics or steroids. Familiarise yourself with the Sick Day Rules, and offer to call the patient back later if you need to double-check your advice.
Safety netting
9. Always give clear safety netting advice, explaining what would be signs of getting worse, and what to do in that event. You could say something like:
‘Let me tell you what signs to look out for, that might indicate things were getting worse. If you start to:
become significantly breathless,
or develop pains in your chest,
or become pale and clammy ‘like someone who is about to vomit”,
or seem muddled or confused
‘then you should seek urgent medical advice.’
Finally, ask ‘Do you have any questions about what I’ve told you?’
Face-to-face consultations.
10. These should be used where there is diagnostic uncertainty either about the cause or the severity of the symptoms.
Make sure you know what the arrangements are for doing this in your practice or service, and how patients are to be segregated or isolated. If the patient needs to be seen face-to-face, tell them what to expect.

Video consultations: a guide for practice
Posted by BJGP Life | 18 Mar 2020 | Coronavirus | 0
Many practices are now using or considering using alternatives to face-to-face consultations because of concerns about Covid-19. Important new information and guidance is now available to support video consultations. Produced by researchers at the University of Oxford, the document covers five key topics. When are video consultations appropriate, how can a practice get ready for them, how can clinicians conduct high-quality video consultations, what can patients do to prepare for and take part in them, and what is the research evidence for their quality and safety?
This document is packed with extremely useful, practical advice and tips to help doctors,other primary care clinicians, and patients navigate these almost uncharted waters at a time of unprecedented challenge for the health service.
The PDF document with the full guidance is available below and can be downloaded.°
Consultations vidéo: informations pour les médecins en cabinet (French version) can be accessed here.°

The Affordable Care Act and USA Healthcare: Reaping the Whirlwind
Posted by BJGP Life | 21 Jun 2016 | BJGP Long Read, International, Opinion, Political | 0
Professor John Frey III is now retired from the University of Wisconsin Department of Family Medicine and Community Health but is still an active teacher, research collaborator, journal editor and ‘faculty whisperer’ about career transitions at all stages of professional life (a free service but you have to buy lunch). He lives most of the year in Santa Fe New Mexico but also part time Madison Wisconsin.
United States presidential elections are ridiculously expensive, far too drawn out, and provide an enormous amount of money for the media consultants to try to convince voters – or more likely scare them – into one position to the other. It is hard to imagine what the initial Republican Clown Car full of candidates must have looked like to the rest of the world. Culling them to a single individual has not helped all that much. Why those who suffer adverse effects from social determinants of health such as poverty, social isolation, family dissolution and low educational achievement continue to vote against their own interests and are attracted to a jingoist real estate developer and ‘small government’ libertarians has been and will be a subject of continuing analysis. Twentieth century history had lots of examples of dangerous demagoguery and likely so will the 21st.
The current situation seems to say “experience and ideas and policy don’t matter, only generalized anger”. Health care always comes up in the Republican debates as “get rid of Obamacare” as I have mentioned previously, with nothing to replace it.[1] Donald Trump infuriates the Republicans by not following the party line on health care and seemingly wants not only to keep the Affordable Care Act (ACA) but improve it in some way that he seems reluctant to describe. But Trump’s daily policy swings assure only that whatever he says he would do will likely turn out to be something else. Health care is more central in the Democratic duo, framed as a ‘pragmatist’ who can get improvements to the Affordable Care Act done versus an ‘idealist’ who advocates a national health system run by government. Having worked hard to help create two Democratic Pyrrhic victories – Eugene McCarthy in 1968 which helped elect Richard Nixon and George McGovern in 1972 which assured a repeat victory by Nixon – I personally am not anxious to stick to the purity of progressive beliefs and bring the world President Trump. Despite different visions of progress in health care, there has been movement, with Secretary Clinton suggesting permitting some people who are still working to enroll in Medicare – the program for elderly and disabled – as an addition to the ACA.
Meanwhile, the ACA moves on to insure more and more people, with the percentage of uninsured now at its lowest point in history. Young people were supposed to be the low risk participants that would offset the high risk pool, and that has happened to a great extent, although not at the levels that the government had hoped. To their credit, young people realize that having health insurance actually frees them to experiment with jobs and careers that don’t carry health benefits. As a result they are busier than ever with entrepreneurial startups and small businesses which are the life blood of society. Not tying health insurance to a job has had a positive effect on what has been labeled the ‘gig economy’ – freelancing and session work controlled by the person rather than the company. If an insured young person in the gig economy breaks a leg, it won’t mean that they have to go live with their parents because they are bankrupt. There has also not been the predicted disconnect between work-related health care as a benefit which has been the foundation of US health insurance. Companies still offer it to most employees, in part because it is a large tax deduction that industry does not want to lose and also because there is renewed competition for workers as the economy speeds up. Private coverage was declining before the ACA was passed but appears to have leveled off. While a substantial victory for the forces of good, the ACA has exposed other problems with the way Americans think about health care and have infused our culture since the mid-20th century.
Two historic cultural problems:
Insurance companies are our friends and protectors
The reforms that had led to a five year leveling off of the cost of health care in the US are now starting to be threatened by two themes that are deeply ingrained in the US psyche: first, the belief that private insurance rather than the government works in the best interests of the people and, second, that getting something for ‘free’ will create an overuse of health services by patients. These two beliefs were sowed in the wind of public opinion back in the mid-20th Century and now the country is reaping the whirlwind. While the rest of the economically developed world adapts health systems to a changing society, the US remains stuck in 75 year old arguments.
The fact that private insurance companies compensate hospitals and physicians and pay for drugs for claims submitted to Medicare always comes as a surprise to the public – and sometimes to physician colleagues. Private insurance companies are contracted as ‘fiscal intermediaries’ for state and federal governments to manage programs like Medicare and Medicaid, for the elderly and the poor. The public has the image of an office building of government bureaucrats in green eyeshades and quill pens in Washington writing checks for over a trillion dollars to health care providers. But these contracts with private insurers limit the percentage of management fees the insurance companies can charge. Allowing ‘only’ a 4% overhead charge to manage Medicare may seem restrictive compared to the up to 20% overhead allowed by the ACA that companies can charge for private plans for the ironically titled ‘medical-loss ratio’ which treats payments for medical care as a ‘loss’ to insurance companies. But because there are more than 55 million of us on Medicare and growing daily, the billions of dollars that insurance companies get yearly to manage a straightforward program with minimal complexity is not so shabby.
But, despite a great deal of research to the contrary,
the public still feels that private insurance companies with high overheads and deceptive practices deliver better quality care than government programs. The Republican Party takes advantage of that belief to denigrate Medicare and Medicaid and the ACA and threaten to turn those programs to the private sector. (Sound familiar?) Not coincidentally the Republicans receive a great deal of money from insurance companies and present no alternative to the ACA other than ‘trust the insurance companies rather than the government’.
On the Democratic side, Senator Sanders picks up on one element of the progressive agenda which started in the late 1940s with President Truman and dwells on the ‘single payer’ mantra which, like so many other sound bites, is not really understood even by those who advocate for it.[2] The problem with ‘single payer’ is that, unless there is a rapid realignment of payment toward primary care and a change from the fee-for-service, production model which dominates US health care, it really would rapidly bankrupt the system. Ontario, in the Canadian single payer system, has moved most of its primary care to a capitated model and salaried service in part because of the strains of fee-for-service care but even with that change, continues to struggle with the right governance and accountability.[3]
In many ways, the whole debate for this presidential election threatens to be a war of sound bites, ‘single payer’ on the left vs. ‘end Obamacare’ on the right with neither party having the skills or the American people having the patience to actually understand what those phrases mean. And no one is discussing the 30 million Americans – the young, the low income families, and the undocumented workers who remain without health insurance.
While ‘universal coverage’ may mean what it says, it may have an asterisk next to it saying “except the 11 million undocumented workers who live here now and who we would like to ignore”. No one wants to have a serious conversation about immigrants at any level.
Being insured yet with ‘out of pocket’ expenses:
I have a photo from a collection from the National Archives of photos taken during the 1930s that shows a general practitioner sitting at his desk with a stern look on his face and a sign that reads ‘Consultations: Cash Only’. While one might be amused by the 80 year old photo, offices and hospitals are more subtle about it now but still demand payment from the patient, even if the patient has health insurance. ‘Co-pay’ and ‘deductible’ are the terms used these days for the portion of the bill patients must pay and are among the more maddening aspects of US health economics. Patients who have to make frequent visits may have $40 charges for each visit in addition to their insurance and so patients with chronic diseases which require frequent monitoring can quickly run up bills that keep them away even though they are ‘insured’. Drug costs are another example. I am on an anticoagulant for which I had a ‘co-pay’ of $15/month for the past year but my most recent refill said I had to pay $50/month for the same drug. The pharmacist gave me no reason and the health plan gave me no warning. All insurance products carry what is termed ‘deductibles’ which is the amount of money patients must pay before the insurance actually pays. The tiers of the ACA have decreasing deductibles with increasing cost of overall insurance. Patients still roll the dice when they are ‘covered’. A recent study reported that two thirds of Americans could not cover a $500 emergency and health insurance deductibles are ‘limited’ to $6850 under the least expensive plan in the ACA market! Such reliably conservative sources as the Wall Street Journal and Forbes have written about how the cost of health care for the average family is rising, even as more people gain insurance, and this cost is creating delays in getting care or receiving appropriate preventive screening. Bankruptcy from lack of insurance is being replaced by bankruptcy from deductibles. What is going on??!!
Underlying all this is the peculiar US cultural belief that if you get something for nothing, you will both over use the service and not value it. When, in the 1980s,
Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) made it possible for visits for preventive care and chronic illness to be free, the use of services saw an 18 month uptick but then settled into a predictable pattern of use. Nevertheless, the country has been furiously backpedaling away from the idea of free-at-the-point-of-service care, adding co-pays and other costs to patients to try to steer them away from, for example, emergency rooms or certain medications. It reminds one of the airline industry where what appear to be inexpensive trips suddenly become expensive because of add ons like paying for bags, paying for a seat with leg room, or paying to get on early, all of which add billions of dollars of revenue that was not planned by travelers.
So there continues to be a dance that insurance companies, employers, state and federal government and citizens engage in that keeps health insurance from being simple to understand and that gives energy to the call for ‘single payer’ without having to deal with the insurance companies and their deductibles. The problem with that approach, sadly, is that the largest single component of the US Gross Domestic Product is unlikely to go through a radical change without resistance from those who stand to lose – including doctors, hospitals, Pharma and insurance companies. And if the NHS, with a long history of being widely accepted as the way to do medical care right, continues to struggle with history, economics and a changing world, one can imagine what lies ahead for the Affordable Care Act, which the Republican congress wants to undermine rather than fix.
A colleague, Paul Gordon MD MPH, a Professor of Family Medicine at the University of Arizona, is on sabbatical bicycling across the United States listening in small communities to people’s opinions and thoughts about Obamacare and writing and recording these stories. It is literally a ground level view of what is happening. (You can read Paul’s stories on his blog: https://bikelisteningtour.wordpress.com/ ) He reports the ambivalence and lack of clarity about the ACA that shows how far the country has to go to get it right. However, the percentage of people who see the ACA as positive is climbing and the percentage of those who are negative is dropping and the lines are likely to cross with the next presidency. But that may not happen if the forces of deception, greed and world class dissembling continue to dominate US politics. Paul Starr’s opening line from his landmark book on the history of American medicine, “the dream of reason did not take power into account” summarizes what lies ahead whatever happens in the US elections.[4] Perhaps a corollary to Starr’s comment is that the dream of reason did not take mindless demagoguery into account, either.

BJGP Open: adapting primary care for migrants
Posted by Euan Lawson | 16 Feb 2017 | BJGP Open, Bright Ideas and Innovation, Opinion, Research | 0
Photo by shawn at Morguefile.com
The aim of this paper was to provide some insight into how primary care is managing to offer care to migrants. In particular they were interested in looking at the challenges and the ways in which practices and practitioners were adapting to meet this need.
The first phase was an online survey. During this they surveyed 70 primary care practitioners. They then used responses to select eight case studies for a further qualitative phase. They had a mix of mainstream GP practices as well as specialist services that offered tailored services to refugees, asylum seekers and other migrants. There was one group interview (with three GPs from the same city) and seven further in-depth interviews. The descriptive analysis was structured around the principles of equitable care that drew on the framework from Browne et al.
They found that practitioners tended to focus on working with community and external agencies and adapted their own processes in order to avoid care. This was particularly evident in areas such as screening, vaccination, and health checks. The biggest barrier was the lack of funding and this was cited in 73% of cases. The organisation and partnerships were regarded as particularly important to ensure there is an awareness of wider social determinants, the impacts of trauma and violence, and all this had to be wrapped up into culturally-competent care.
Opinion: There is a small section in this paper that caught my eye in relation to burnout. Just over one-third (34%) cited personal fatigue/burnout/capacity as a barrier to developing services. The additional workload ramped up the stress for some healthcare professionals and in one of the services they had introduced life coaching. In another they had adopted debriefings that are similar to those used in conflict areas.
“I think in terms of values, everyone sees the work that we do in serving vulnerable groups as a privilege.”
I’d put a positive spin on the burnout angle – it can be enormously re-invigorating to get involved with marginalised groups. As one ‘mainstream’ GP stated: “I think in terms of values, everyone sees the work that we do in serving vulnerable groups as a privilege.”
There are some fine examples in this paper on how primary care can be developed to give a more “equity-oriented service”. It showcases how, despite all the appalling strain on the system, there are still ways for primary care to innovate to reduce health inequalities. More than anything we should be driven by the principle that we need to reduce health inequalities to improve our societies. And sometimes we need to hunt these people down. Whether it is people with learning disabilities, or the mentally ill, or people who inject drugs, the homeless or as in this case migrants and refugees – these are the groups of people that need our attention.

Churchill Fellowships: an opportunity to make a difference
Posted by BJGP Life | 22 Mar 2019 | Scholarship | 0
David Jeffrey is a palliative care doctor and member of the Advisory Council of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust.
Churchill Fellowships are awarded by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust (WCMT) to enable UK citizens to explore innovative ideas abroad and return with new insights which address key issues facing our society. A wide range of categories are open to applicants at all levels and include healthcare and innovation in the 21st century, palliative care, suicide prevention, migration, rural communities and access to healthcare.
General practitioners are closely involved with many of these issues, yet few apply for Churchill Fellowships. This paradox may, in part, be due to a lack of awareness of the availability and scope of Churchill Fellowships. General practitioners in the UK also face a number of challenges: accessibility, continuity, stress and low morale.1Baird B, Charles A, Honeyman M, Maguire D, Das P. Understanding pressures in general practice. The King’s Fund. London 2016. These challenges are exacerbated by factors such as: falling numbers, early retirement, recruitment and the widespread involvement of locums. The challenges facing GPs are another key issue for our society.
WCMT are keen to encourage GPs to apply for Churchill Fellowships and are willing to be flexible about project plans.
Churchill Fellowships offer hard-pressed GPs an opportunity to take a short but valuable amount of time away from their work, to address some of these challenges. Fellows are funded to spend 4-8 weeks anywhere in the world, pursuing research of their own devising. By travelling abroad to meet colleagues in primary care, they may gain insights which they can share when they return home. The Winston Churchill Memorial Trust has both a network of Fellows and partnerships with other organisations that can help to disseminate innovative ideas for good practice.
The Winston Churchill Memorial Trust (WCMT) was established in 1965, as a national memorial to Sir Winston Churchill. Since then WCMT has sent out over 5,500 Fellows worldwide. Applications for the next round of Fellowships opens in May 2019 and closes in September 2019. Details of WCMT and the application process are available on the website.
Applicants must be UK citizens over the age of 18. The application process is straightforward, beginning with an initial outline project plan. In contrast to academic research bids, the application form is simple. If the application is judged by the WCMT panel to be of potential benefit to a community in the UK, as well as to the applicant, and is a practical plan which can be carried out in the time, the applicant may be shortlisted. Shortlisted applicants are invited to submit a more detailed plan which also describes how they will disseminate the lessons learned from their Fellowship. The short-listed applicants are interviewed by the panel in the WCMT offices in London. Successful applications need to demonstrate the potential of their Fellowship to make a difference and promote change.
The Churchill Fellowships are usually 4-8 weeks in duration, and this can be split into separate periods to allow for workplace responsibilities. The awards which cover living costs, travel and accommodation, vary between £4,000 and £10,000. There is no availability for payment of locum cover. Perhaps the most significant benefit of a Fellowship is that it opens doors to meeting leaders in the Fellow’s field of interest. WCMT staff offer support and advice throughout the whole process. The Trust encourage Fellows to leave spaces in their itinerary to follow up serendipitous contacts which always occur during their visit.
Following the completion of the Fellowship, the Fellow is expected to submit a report to WCMT which describes their findings and dissemination plans. The report is primarily for the Fellow to focus their reflections and recommendations for implementing change, as a public manifesto for their ideas. At this stage, WCMT knowledge partners can be of assistance in ensuring that the conclusions reach those in a position to implement change.
WCMT are keen to encourage GPs to apply for Churchill Fellowships and are willing to be flexible about project plans which acknowledge the difficulties in taking prolonged leave from practice. The benefit from a Fellowship is not limited to an individual but extends to his/her workplace, community and sometimes nationally. Browsing the WCMT website reveals a range of projects covered in Fellowships, including child bereavement, assisted suicide, prison medicine, child abuse, mental health and well-being.
My Churchill Fellowship, in 2006, explored how healthcare professionals viewed assisted dying in the North West United States. The six-week Fellowship was based in Seattle and Portland. The Churchill Fellowship opened doors to leaders in the field of end of life care and to those involved in researching and implementing the Death with Dignity Act in Oregon. I was invited into multidisciplinary meetings, met doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists and ethicists at work and in their homes. As a result of the Fellowship, my objections to the legalisation of assisted suicide were informed by the views and experiences of these colleagues in the United States. Back in the UK, I became involved in the national debate around assisted suicide and published a book expressing palliative care perspectives on this issue.2Jeffrey D. Against Physician Assisted Suicide: a palliative care perspective. Radcliffe Publishing, Oxford (2009)
A Churchill Fellowship can be a life-changing experience, offering a break to address an important issue and to return refreshed with new insights which can lead to improvements in primary care. I hope colleagues in primary care will explore the WCMT website and feel encouraged to apply for a Churchill Fellowship.

Video consultations: a guide for practice
by BJGP Life | Mar 18, 2020 | Coronavirus | 0
Many practices are now using or considering using alternatives to face-to-face consultations because of concerns about Covid-19. Important new information and guidance is now available to support video consultations. Produced by researchers at the University of Oxford, the document covers five key topics. When are video consultations appropriate, how can a practice get ready for them, how can clinicians conduct high-quality video consultations, what can patients do to prepare for and take part in them, and what is the research evidence for their quality and safety?

Next GP Journal Club is Sunday 3rd July at 8pm: migraine and CV disease in women
Posted by BJGP Life | 27 Jun 2016 | Clinical, GP Journal Club | 0
The next GP Journal Club will be discussing the BMJ paper:
Migraine and risk of cardiovascular disease in women: prospective cohort study by Kurth et al.
You can download it here.
Migraine occurs in 15% of the UK adult population and is three times more common in women. This large cohort study from the US suggests that female migraine sufferers are at increased risk of experiencing cardiovascular events. What will this mean for those of us in primary care who have responsibility for managing cardiovascular risk? Should we be advising all female migraine sufferers to take a statin, for instance?
Please read the article and consider your response to the following questions, which will form the basis of our discussion:
Was their PPI strategy appropriate? Would the study have benefited from more patient involvement?
Elevated cholesterol and hypertension were treated as binary variables, is this acceptable
15.2% of the women reported a diagnosis of migraine at baseline. Is this what you would expect if the cohort was representative?
Does it surprise you that the effects of migraine weren’t modified by other factors such as hypertension and smoking?
Based on this study, should we be paying more attention to assessment of migraine sufferers’ CV risk?
Hope to see you all on Twitter next Sunday at 8pm.

The man in sideroom 2
Posted by BJGP Life | 9 Jan 2018 | Undergraduate | 1
Chloe Webster is a 4th year medical student, a yogaholic, creative writing enthusiast, and an aspiring future GP.
Through the zig-zag maze of the ward, he was in the first room on the left. An odd-shaped room, tucked in tight, just after the double doors. Blink and you miss it. The room was small, but he had made it his own. His coat was hung over the high back of the armchair. The wheeled table cluttered with all his favourite books. This was the first time I met him, but I could tell from his hospital room that he had been here for a very long time. The room had become a home away from home. He was going to die here.
Today was my first day on the ward. I joined my consultant for his morning ward round. A tall, thin man greets me. He always wore practical shoes: a pair of black slip-ons, with his stripy socks pulled up high. His hair is short, and sticks up. The picture ID on his hospital lanyard shows a much younger man, with more hair too. His glasses frame his slender face. His expression was always one of deep understanding. He never said much, but heard more than what was said to him.
We are stood at the nursing station. A cramped alcove budding off from the main part of the ward. It is cluttered with multi-coloured policy folders and loose pieces of paper. The telephone is always ringing. One of the nurses comes over to speak to the consultant.
“The family are here to see you”, she says. He looks up, and nods in response.
We make our way to sideroom 2.
Four of us enter. Now there are six people in the small room. The patient, his wife, the consultant, the registrar, the FY2, and me. I stand in the corner of the room, trying not to get in anyone’s way. I don’t really know what is happening. I simply stand and watch.
The occupant of the room is an elderly gentleman. His face is aged, and an unkempt beard has grown wildly off his jaw. He has teeth missing from years of heavy smoking. He is sat up in the armchair by the side of the bed. He wears a blue, stripy jumper. A blanket is drawn around him, but I can see that he has an above knee amputation. His wife sits opposite him, gracefully perched on a foot rest. The two of them separated by the table in between scattered with books. She is also elderly. Her face is less aged, but I can see she has been crying from the redness of her eyes. Her gaze is fixed down at her husband’s hand held tightly in hers.
I don’t really remember much of what the consultant said at this point. It is a day that I have suppressed to the back of my mind. It is a bad memory.
I’ll never forget his wife crying. Floods of tears streamed down her face. They were told that he wasn’t going to get better, and a time was coming where there would be nothing else that they could do. He was approaching the end of his life. She tried to hold back her emotions, but she couldn’t. She was going to lose her husband. Her grip on his hand tightened. Her husband’s response was very different. He wasn’t sad. He wore a smile across his face. I think this was for his wife’s benefit. He knew that the time was coming. His health had been deteriorating over the past months, fluid was overloading his body. His wife had buried her head in her hands, making her body smaller and smaller as she shrunk in to the foot stool.
I started crying. I drew myself further and further back in to the corner of the room hoping that no one would see me.
I remember the registrar frantically scribbling in the notes, recording every word that the consultant said. The FY2 offered a tissue to the wife, but I just stood there. I started crying. I drew myself further and further back in to the corner of the room hoping that no one would see me. I could hear the true sadness in his wife’s voice. She tried to speak, but her words trembled uncontrollably. It made me so sad to think that soon she would be alone. The FY2 soon noticed me. Tears were beginning to roll down my face. She took me outside. I didn’t go back in to the sideroom. After a few minutes, the others followed and left the room. They simply carried on with the rest of the morning ward round.
A few days later, I returned to my base ward. Without thinking, instinctively I went to the central hub of the nursing station. I looked up at the big whiteboard on the wall, detailing all the current patients. No matter how hard I looked, no matter how many times I double checked, I couldn’t find his name.
I went to the room. The door was wide open, the room was empty.
There was no coat, no pile of books carefully stacked on the table.
He was gone.

Beautifully written – I enjoyed reading it. We must make sure that as the years pass we don’t lose sight of the human story behind the medical problems that are presented to us. In other words, we mustn’t stop caring.
