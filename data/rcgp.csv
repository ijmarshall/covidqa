Covid-19 (coronavirus)
COVID-19 (coronavirus)
The COVID-19 outbreak is arguably one of the greatest public health challenges of our time – not least for general practice, where over 1 million patients are already treated every day.
The College is closely monitoring the situation and developing practical resources and support for GPs and their teams. We have launched specific guidance [PDF] for general practice, including out-of-hours. This will be updated as the situation develops but things are extremely fast moving so please make sure you are using the latest version.
We hope you will find this page and its resources useful in your day to day work and for keeping yourselves, your families and your patients as safe as you possibly can be over the coming difficult weeks and months.
Every attempt will be taken to keep this advice current but please continue to refer to the latest advice in your area.
Contact us
RCGP members can email our dedicated COVID-19 inbox with feedback and questions.
Please keep your questions coming as they're also helping us populate our COVID-19 FAQs (see below). We have convened a group of GP experts on emergency preparedness to answer these and are also bringing together helpful material from elsewhere to make this the 'go to' resource for GPs.
If your practice has experienced any difficulties in implementing the current guidance or protocols, please let us know so we can provide feedback to the relevant authorities.
Email: Covid19@rcgp.org.uk

COVID-19 CPD hub for GPs
We’re bringing together a range of learning resources to help you manage COVID-19. Visit our new, free COVID-19 CPD hub for practical support, advice and tools to support you through this challenging time. The hub will be updated daily with new resources and information.
Frequently asked questions from our members
Clinical guidance
How do I deal with a patient who has flu symptoms and needs an appointment?
Where possible Telephone / Video Assessment should be a first step to risk assess. Do they meet the current COVID-19 criteria?
When and how do I use PPE?
In suspected cases that meet case definition (see links below) then face-to-face assessment in primary care (including out-of-hours centres and GP hubs) must be avoided if possible. If contact is unavoidable with confirmed or suspected cases then the appropriate PPE should be worn at all times (see links below).
In addition, we recommend that a universal approach is taken wearing PPE for patients with new onset
symptoms. It is critical that PPE is used correctly as per the following guidance alongside hand washing before and after patient contact.

What do you advise for Immunosuppressed patients?
It is likely that those who are immunosuppressed are at higher risk. Because of this they would fit into the category of people who should take particular care to minimise social contact, regardless of age. Current government guidance is that such people should be largely shielded from social contact until the 11 May 2020. As for everyone, these patients should adhere to normal precautions as advised by their national public health body for avoiding transmission.
If they develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19 then advice should be sought from their specialist team. Patients should continue any current treatment they are on unless advised otherwise (in particular long-term steroids).
In primary care every effort should be made to carry out consultations remotely to avoid transmission. In secondary care it is likely that many outpatient appointments will be changed to remote consultation, patients should wait to be informed about this.
Specific Cases
Guidance for adrenal and pituitary insufficient patients
Guidance from the British Society for Rheumatology
What do I advise pregnant women?
Because COVID-19 is a new pathogen, its effect in pregnancy is not fully understood. As a precaution, current government guidance is that all pregnant women should be largely shielded from social contact until the 11 May 2020. There is currently no evidence of increased risk to mother or baby.
Guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on Coronavirus infection and pregnancy
Guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in pregnancy [PDF]
Is there any guidance as to whether steroids are harmful-or useful-in the initial stages of infection with COVID-19?
Patients on long-term steroids are likely to be at 'high risk'. Should a patient on long-term steroids become unwell then these should not be stopped abruptly and advice should be sought from their specialist team.
Advice on long-term steroids from the British Society of Rheumatology
What guidance can you give on seeing children?
From the evidence we have so far, children with COVID-19 appear to be less severely affected compared to adults. As with all patients, children should be triaged prior to any face to face consultation. Every effort should be made to avoid a face to face assessment if clinically appropriate to avoid transmission. If a face to face assessment is unavoidable and a case of COVID-19 is suspected then usual infection control measures should be employed. Extra care should be taken to assess for symptoms in any accompanying adults before seeing face to face. Parents should be advised that the child and their household should follow self-isolation guidance as usual and as best they can.
Are NSAIDs contradicted in cases of COVID-19?
There has been some concern that NSAIDs could prolong illness or increase the risk of further severity:
Guidance from BMJ on Covid-19: ibuprofen should not be used for managing symptoms, say doctors and scientists
Guidance from The Lancet: Are patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus at increased risk for COVID-19 infection?
Further evidence is required in this area. The Centre for Evidence Based Medicine has advised caution when prescribing NSAIDs in context of Acute Respiratory Infections.
The Committee of Human Medicines and NICE have been tasked with reviewing the evidence. NHS England Medical Director Professor Stephen Powis advised on 18/03/20 that in the interim patients who have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should use paracetamol in preference to NSAIDs. Those currently on NSAIDs for other reasons should not stop them.
The consultation
How can I set up video consultations?
Guidance from Oxford COVID-19 Evidence Service
Download the Video consultations: information for GPs from the University of Oxford [PDF]
What advice is available to patients for whom English is not their first language?
Asylum seekers and immigrants will have to be advised to self-isolate in the same way as others. We are contacting relevant authorities about how to achieve this. There is translating guidance available in many different languages.
Guidance from Doctors of the World
Practice management
How can I set up triage systems?
The RCGP are looking to support clinicians who are unfamiliar with clinical assessment remotely by telephone.
Simon Stockley and Roger Neighbour have written a blog post: Top 10 tips for COVID-19 telephone consultations.
What about staff who are pregnant?
Please see FAQ on pregnant women for general advice. It is advised that pregnant women who can work from home should do so. If they work in a patient facing role then it may be possible to modify this in order to minimise exposure. The Royal College for Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is currently working on specific guidance for healthcare professionals who are pregnant.
What guidance can you provide on staff who become unwell or who are following social distancing?
Any staff member who has possible coronavirus should follow the normal stay at home guidance:
Health Protection England stay at home guidance
Health Protection Scotland stay at home guidance
Staff who become unwell and are self-isolating should be supported in working from home if they are able/willing/well enough to do so.
We advise that staff who are following social distancing SHOULD NOT be working in patient facing roles and priority should be made for them to work remotely if possible. Some staff, such as those with severe underlying conditions such as cancer or previous transplant, are at particular risk and they are advised to stringently follow the latest social distancing rules. It is likely that this group will be contacted individually in the coming weeks with further guidance.
Health Protection England social distancing rules
Health Protection Scotland social distancing rules
At what point should I consider closing my practice?
This should only be done in consultation with the local CCG or Health Board, or relevant national public health body depending upon the reason you may think this appropriate, e.g. lack of clinicians or mass contamination.
Staff and wellbeing
Should I self-isolate if family members are?
Current guidance is that if a member of your household develops symptoms consistent with the case definition of COVID-19 then the entire household should self-isolate for 14 days.
Will there be access for healthcare staff to be tested if they become symptomatic or have contact with a suspected case?
The College appreciates there is a legitimate demand for testing of staff to reduce the need for self-isolation. The College is working with the government to make this possible however due to capacity for testing this is unlikely to be in place in the next few weeks. It is possible that a new point of care test may become available in the future. Current guidance is that you should continue working unless you develop symptoms, in which case you should adhere to the latest guidelines on self-isolation.
Training and licensing
What is the RCGP's policy on appraisals?
The RCGP has created resources related to the impact of COVID-19 on appraisals.
Will the College allow me to take my exams?
Updates will be posted on our main MRCGP page.
How will retired GPs' licenses be reactivated?
The College is seeking to clarify how the details of this would work. We expect the GMC to contact retired GPs in the first instance. We will provide further details of this process as soon as we are able to. The college has a late career and retired members group and we will be working with them to discuss how to support retired members who come forward.
As a trainee, if I need to self-isolate, how will I be able to make up time?
It is important that trainees, as with all staff, strictly follow self-isolation guidelines. The College will be working closely on issues related to COVID-19 and its impact on training with other bodies including Health Education England and the General Medical Council. We will update trainees when we are able to provide more information.
Money and Indemnity
If as a locum I need to self-isolate, is there a way to protect my income?
As a locum GP you are self-employed which means that you are responsible for covering your own sick pay, unless you have negotiated this in your terms and conditions. If you have an income protection plan or critical illness cover then these may be relevant so be sure to check your policy. If you have an independent financial advisor then you may want to contact them for individual advice. The government announced in the budget some changes for those that are not eligible for statutory sick pay. For example, the self-employed or people earning below the Lower Earnings Limit of £118 per week, can now more easily make a claim for Universal Credit or Contributory Employment and Support Allowance.
Will I need to adjust my indemnity arrangements?
COVID-19 will likely have a significant impact on member';s day to day work, locality, risk management and supervision of others.
For members in England, the Government’s state-backed clinical negligence scheme for general practice (CNSGP) applies.
The Department for Health and Social Care have advised the RCGP that:
‘Healthcare workers and others that are already covered for their day-today NHS activities by the Clinical Negligence Scheme for General Practice (CNSGP), will continue to receive clinical negligence indemnity cover from CNSGP for NHS activities connected to the diagnosis, care or treatment of a person in consequence of the coronavirus pandemic.’
With regard to the CNSGP NHS England has stated that:
It covers primary care services commissioned under a GMS, PMS or APMS contract, where these services are being provided directly or under a direct sub-contract. The location of the services and whether they are digital or face-to-face will not affect the cover. The particular solution used to provide the online or video consultation is not relevant to the scope of the scheme and there is no requirement to notify NHS Resolution of a particular solution which is used.
The place at which activities are carried out, the status of the person carrying out the activity, the form of the entity responsible for the provision of the NHS services in question and the individual circumstances of the patient concerned (including their age) are not relevant to the scope of CNSGP.
For members in Wales, we are awaiting on an official line from the Welsh government about their state-backed indemnity scheme.
For members in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where there is no state-backed scheme, members are advised to contact their respective indemnity providers should they have concerns regarding their personal indemnity cover with regards to COVID-19.

MRCGP exam overview
MRCGP exam overview
COVID-19 - CSA examination cancellation
The College has today announced that the Clinical Skills Assessment examination will not be running from tomorrow (Thursday 19 March) and the Applied Knowledge Test will no longer go ahead on 29 April.
In effect all MRCGP examinations are cancelled until further notice and we are unable to accept or reschedule any more bookings.
CSA Examination Cancellation
We have been following advice from the CMO and Government and were committed to running the CSA examination for as long as we could, while it was safe and responsible to do so, to help as many trainees as possible to complete their training. However, the situation has now changed dramatically. The Government has advised against any non-essential travel, and trainees and examiners are finding it harder to leave their practices, while those with underlying health conditions have been advised to exercise caution and may decide to self-isolate.
We are contacting all candidates who are booked to sit the CSA in March and April to let them know that their scheduled examination will not go ahead and advising them not to travel to London for the examination.
Our immediate priority is to those candidates affected, but a full set of FAQs will follow on the RCGP website shortly.
Examination fees will be carried over to the rescheduled sitting and we will ensure that all examinations are rescheduled at a time when we can run them safely and reliably. If candidates have already paid for travel or accommodation we recommend that they contact the provider in the first instance to seek a refund.
We are sorry for the inconvenience or anxiety that this causes but we are working in a difficult and changing situation. All of our examiners are working GPs, and many are trainers, and they are also working hard to make sure that their practices and patients are supported, as well as committing time to run the examination.
Please keep checking our website for more information. The RCGP examination staff will not be able to provide any additional information so we recommend that you do not telephone the office at this stage.
AKT Examination Cancellation
We had been committed to running the AKT examination on 29 April, but it will now will need to be rescheduled at a time when it can be run safely. At this stage we are unable to provide a date for the rearranged examination as, like the CSA, we will have to react to the changing situation created by the spread of Covid-19.
We are unable to accept or reschedule any more bookings.
Our immediate priority has been to let those affected know as quickly as possible, and a full set of FAQs on our examinations will be published on the RCGP website shortly.
Candidates will receive a notification from Pearson VUE - the company that runs the AKT - in the next few days which will confirm that the current booking has been cancelled.
In the light of some Pearson VUE test centres closing or reducing capacity in some areas, some candidates may have already received a notification advising them to reschedule. They are advised to please ignore any such notifications and await official confirmation of the overall cancellation.
The fees paid for the examination will be carried over to the rescheduled sitting. The RCGP examination staff will not be able to provide any additional information at this stage so we would ask you please not to phone the office.
The College is working hard to support all GPs, including trainees, during the Covid-19 pandemic and advice and information are being added to our website regularly.
Thank you for your understanding and forbearance.
MRCGP is an integrated assessment system, success in which confirms that a doctor has satisfactorily completed specialty training for general practice, and is competent to enter independent practice in the United Kingdom without further supervision. Satisfactory completion of the MRCGP is a pre-requisite for the issue of a certificate of completion of training (CCT) and full Membership of the RCGP.
MRCGP comprises three separate components: an Applied Knowledge Test (AKT), a Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA) and Workplace Based Assessment (WPBA), each of which tests different competences using validated assessment methods and which together cover the spectrum of knowledge, skills, behaviours and attitudes defined by the GP Specialty Training curriculum.
MRCGP complies with General Medical Council (GMC) standards on validity, reliability, feasibility, cost effectiveness, opportunities for feedback and impact on learning. It also follows best practice in assessment, quality assurance and standard setting.
The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and the General Medical Council have set expectations about the currency of national professional examinations and the number of attempts permissible.

Applied Knowledge Test (AKT)
The Applied Knowledge Test is a summative assessment of the knowledge base that underpins independent general practice in the United Kingdom within the context of the National Health Service. Trainees who pass this assessment will have demonstrated their competence in applying knowledge at a level which is sufficiently high for independent practice.
Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA)
The CSA is a summative assessment of a doctor's ability to integrate and apply clinical, professional, communication and practical skills appropriate for general practice. Simulating a typical NHS surgery clinic the CSA assesses a range of scenarios from general practice relevant to most parts of the curriculum which can also target particular aspects of clinical care and expertise.
Workplace Based Assessment (WPBA)
WPBA evaluates the trainee's progress in areas of professional practice best tested in the workplace and:
looks at the trainee's performance in their day to day practice to provide evidence for learning and reflection based on real experiences
supports and drives learning in important areas of competence with an underlying theme of patient safety
provides constructive feedback on areas of strength and developmental needs, identifying trainees who may be in difficulty and need more help
evaluates aspects of professional behaviour that are difficult to assess in the Applied Knowledge Test and Clinical Skills Assessment
determines fitness to progress towards completion of training.
Evidence of WPBA, as approved by the GMC, includes the completion of specific assessments and reports, the documentation of naturally occurring evidence, as well as certain mandatory requirements such as Child Safeguarding and Basic Life Support. More information on the requirements for WPBA can be found within the WPBA section on this website.
MRCGP Applied Knowledge Test (AKT)
The AKT forms part of the MRCGP. It is a summative assessment of the knowledge base that underpins independent general practice in the United Kingdom within the context of the National Health Service
MRCGP Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA)
The CSA tests a doctor’s ability to gather information and apply learned understanding of disease processes and person-centred care appropriately in a standardised context

Covid-19 (coronavirus)
COVID-19 (coronavirus)
The COVID-19 outbreak is arguably one of the greatest public health challenges of our time – not least for general practice, where over 1 million patients are already treated every day.
The College is closely monitoring the situation and developing practical resources and support for GPs and their teams. We have launched specific guidance [PDF] for general practice, including out-of-hours. This will be updated as the situation develops but things are extremely fast moving so please make sure you are using the latest version.
We hope you will find this page and its resources useful in your day to day work and for keeping yourselves, your families and your patients as safe as you possibly can be over the coming difficult weeks and months.
Every attempt will be taken to keep this advice current but please continue to refer to the latest advice in your area.
Contact us
RCGP members can email our dedicated COVID-19 inbox with feedback and questions.
Please keep your questions coming as they're also helping us populate our COVID-19 FAQs (see below). We have convened a group of GP experts on emergency preparedness to answer these and are also bringing together helpful material from elsewhere to make this the 'go to' resource for GPs.
If your practice has experienced any difficulties in implementing the current guidance or protocols, please let us know so we can provide feedback to the relevant authorities.

COVID-19 CPD hub for GPs
We’re bringing together a range of learning resources to help you manage COVID-19. Visit our new, free COVID-19 CPD hub for practical support, advice and tools to support you through this challenging time. The hub will be updated daily with new resources and information.
Frequently asked questions from our members
Clinical guidance
How do I deal with a patient who has flu symptoms and needs an appointment?
Where possible Telephone / Video Assessment should be a first step to risk assess. Do they meet the current COVID-19 criteria?
When and how do I use PPE?
In suspected cases that meet case definition (see links below) then face-to-face assessment in primary care (including out-of-hours centres and GP hubs) must be avoided if possible. If contact is unavoidable with confirmed or suspected cases then the appropriate PPE should be worn at all times (see links below).
In addition, we recommend that a universal approach is taken wearing PPE for patients with new onset
symptoms. It is critical that PPE is used correctly as per the following guidance alongside hand washing before and after patient contact.

What do you advise for Immunosuppressed patients?
It is likely that those who are immunosuppressed are at higher risk. Because of this they would fit into the category of people who should take particular care to minimise social contact, regardless of age. Current government guidance is that such people should be largely shielded from social contact until the 11 May 2020. As for everyone, these patients should adhere to normal precautions as advised by their national public health body for avoiding transmission.
If they develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19 then advice should be sought from their specialist team. Patients should continue any current treatment they are on unless advised otherwise (in particular long-term steroids).
In primary care every effort should be made to carry out consultations remotely to avoid transmission. In secondary care it is likely that many outpatient appointments will be changed to remote consultation, patients should wait to be informed about this.
Specific Cases
Guidance for adrenal and pituitary insufficient patients
Guidance from the British Society for Rheumatology
What do I advise pregnant women?
Because COVID-19 is a new pathogen, its effect in pregnancy is not fully understood. As a precaution, current government guidance is that all pregnant women should be largely shielded from social contact until the 11 May 2020. There is currently no evidence of increased risk to mother or baby.
Guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on Coronavirus infection and pregnancy
Guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in pregnancy [PDF]
Is there any guidance as to whether steroids are harmful-or useful-in the initial stages of infection with COVID-19?
Patients on long-term steroids are likely to be at 'high risk'. Should a patient on long-term steroids become unwell then these should not be stopped abruptly and advice should be sought from their specialist team.
Advice on long-term steroids from the British Society of Rheumatology
What guidance can you give on seeing children?
From the evidence we have so far, children with COVID-19 appear to be less severely affected compared to adults. As with all patients, children should be triaged prior to any face to face consultation. Every effort should be made to avoid a face to face assessment if clinically appropriate to avoid transmission. If a face to face assessment is unavoidable and a case of COVID-19 is suspected then usual infection control measures should be employed. Extra care should be taken to assess for symptoms in any accompanying adults before seeing face to face. Parents should be advised that the child and their household should follow self-isolation guidance as usual and as best they can.
Are NSAIDs contradicted in cases of COVID-19?
There has been some concern that NSAIDs could prolong illness or increase the risk of further severity:
Guidance from BMJ on Covid-19: ibuprofen should not be used for managing symptoms, say doctors and scientists
Guidance from The Lancet: Are patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus at increased risk for COVID-19 infection?
Further evidence is required in this area. The Centre for Evidence Based Medicine has advised caution when prescribing NSAIDs in context of Acute Respiratory Infections.
The Committee of Human Medicines and NICE have been tasked with reviewing the evidence. NHS England Medical Director Professor Stephen Powis advised on 18/03/20 that in the interim patients who have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should use paracetamol in preference to NSAIDs. Those currently on NSAIDs for other reasons should not stop them.
The consultation
How can I set up video consultations?
Guidance from Oxford COVID-19 Evidence Service
Download the Video consultations: information for GPs from the University of Oxford [PDF]
What advice is available to patients for whom English is not their first language?
Asylum seekers and immigrants will have to be advised to self-isolate in the same way as others. We are contacting relevant authorities about how to achieve this. There is translating guidance available in many different languages.
Guidance from Doctors of the World
Practice management
How can I set up triage systems?
The RCGP are looking to support clinicians who are unfamiliar with clinical assessment remotely by telephone.
Simon Stockley and Roger Neighbour have written a blog post: Top 10 tips for COVID-19 telephone consultations.
What about staff who are pregnant?
Please see FAQ on pregnant women for general advice. It is advised that pregnant women who can work from home should do so. If they work in a patient facing role then it may be possible to modify this in order to minimise exposure. The Royal College for Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is currently working on specific guidance for healthcare professionals who are pregnant.
What guidance can you provide on staff who become unwell or who are following social distancing?
Any staff member who has possible coronavirus should follow the normal stay at home guidance:
Health Protection England stay at home guidance
Health Protection Scotland stay at home guidance
Staff who become unwell and are self-isolating should be supported in working from home if they are able/willing/well enough to do so.
We advise that staff who are following social distancing SHOULD NOT be working in patient facing roles and priority should be made for them to work remotely if possible. Some staff, such as those with severe underlying conditions such as cancer or previous transplant, are at particular risk and they are advised to stringently follow the latest social distancing rules. It is likely that this group will be contacted individually in the coming weeks with further guidance.
Health Protection England social distancing rules
Health Protection Scotland social distancing rules
At what point should I consider closing my practice?
This should only be done in consultation with the local CCG or Health Board, or relevant national public health body depending upon the reason you may think this appropriate, e.g. lack of clinicians or mass contamination.
Staff and wellbeing
Should I self-isolate if family members are?
Current guidance is that if a member of your household develops symptoms consistent with the case definition of COVID-19 then the entire household should self-isolate for 14 days.
Will there be access for healthcare staff to be tested if they become symptomatic or have contact with a suspected case?
The College appreciates there is a legitimate demand for testing of staff to reduce the need for self-isolation. The College is working with the government to make this possible however due to capacity for testing this is unlikely to be in place in the next few weeks. It is possible that a new point of care test may become available in the future. Current guidance is that you should continue working unless you develop symptoms, in which case you should adhere to the latest guidelines on self-isolation.
Training and licensing
What is the RCGP's policy on appraisals?
The RCGP has created resources related to the impact of COVID-19 on appraisals.
Will the College allow me to take my exams?
Updates will be posted on our main MRCGP page.
How will retired GPs' licenses be reactivated?
The College is seeking to clarify how the details of this would work. We expect the GMC to contact retired GPs in the first instance. We will provide further details of this process as soon as we are able to. The college has a late career and retired members group and we will be working with them to discuss how to support retired members who come forward.
As a trainee, if I need to self-isolate, how will I be able to make up time?
It is important that trainees, as with all staff, strictly follow self-isolation guidelines. The College will be working closely on issues related to COVID-19 and its impact on training with other bodies including Health Education England and the General Medical Council. We will update trainees when we are able to provide more information.
Money and Indemnity
If as a locum I need to self-isolate, is there a way to protect my income?
As a locum GP you are self-employed which means that you are responsible for covering your own sick pay, unless you have negotiated this in your terms and conditions. If you have an income protection plan or critical illness cover then these may be relevant so be sure to check your policy. If you have an independent financial advisor then you may want to contact them for individual advice. The government announced in the budget some changes for those that are not eligible for statutory sick pay. For example, the self-employed or people earning below the Lower Earnings Limit of £118 per week, can now more easily make a claim for Universal Credit or Contributory Employment and Support Allowance.
Will I need to adjust my indemnity arrangements?
COVID-19 will likely have a significant impact on member';s day to day work, locality, risk management and supervision of others.
For members in England, the Government’s state-backed clinical negligence scheme for general practice (CNSGP) applies.
The Department for Health and Social Care have advised the RCGP that:
‘Healthcare workers and others that are already covered for their day-today NHS activities by the Clinical Negligence Scheme for General Practice (CNSGP), will continue to receive clinical negligence indemnity cover from CNSGP for NHS activities connected to the diagnosis, care or treatment of a person in consequence of the coronavirus pandemic.’
With regard to the CNSGP NHS England has stated that:
It covers primary care services commissioned under a GMS, PMS or APMS contract, where these services are being provided directly or under a direct sub-contract. The location of the services and whether they are digital or face-to-face will not affect the cover. The particular solution used to provide the online or video consultation is not relevant to the scope of the scheme and there is no requirement to notify NHS Resolution of a particular solution which is used.
The place at which activities are carried out, the status of the person carrying out the activity, the form of the entity responsible for the provision of the NHS services in question and the individual circumstances of the patient concerned (including their age) are not relevant to the scope of CNSGP.
For members in Wales, we are awaiting on an official line from the Welsh government about their state-backed indemnity scheme.
For members in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where there is no state-backed scheme, members are advised to contact their respective indemnity providers should they have concerns regarding their personal indemnity cover with regards to COVID-19.

Dear Colleague,
NATIONAL SUPPORTING GUIDANCE FOR SCOTTISH GENERAL PRACTICE
The attached document brings together a range of
guidance to support GPs, GPNs,
practice and community nursing teams, other clinicians in the multidisciplinary team,
and Practice management and administration staff to coordinate response activities
for the Covid-19 pandemic. This has been developed and collated by the Primary Care
Division in the Scottish Government, and has been accepted and co-signed by both
the British Medical Association’s Scottish General Practitioner’s Committee and the
Royal College of General Practitioners.
This guidance should be viewed alongside the joint Scottish Government, BMA and
RCGP letter to GP practices issued on 13 March, as well as the Circular to Health
Boards issued by the Scottish Government on 5 March (PCA(M)(2020)02).
This is intended to represent the most up-to-date and comprehensive set of guidance
available to date. We appreciate that you are incredibly busy, but we ask that everyone
working in General Practice try to find time to review or consult this document for the
latest advice on a range of issues.
We recognise that the likely impact of Covid-19 on General Practice capacity and
services, now and in the coming weeks, is rapidly escalating. It has been heartening
to experience and hear of the many examples where members of General Practice
have risen to this challenge, contributed incredible efforts individually and as teams
well over and above the norm, and collaborated with their colleagues and counterparts
across Practices, HSCPs and Health Boards. You are setting the example for helping
to ensure that NHS Scotland is as prepared as possible for this challenge.
https://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/publications/DC20200313covid.pdf
https://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/publications/DC20200313covid.pdf
https://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/pca/PCA2020(M)02.pdf
Helpful guidance and other forms of support for people working in the Primary Care
community is emerging from many places as clinicians and practice staff pull together
to respond to Covid-19. This is hugely encouraging. We also recognise that there is a
complex landscape of advice emerging as the local, national and UK-wide landscape
evolves rapidly, and that this is happening at a time when clarity is essential. To this
end, the Primary Care Division in the Scottish Government is doing its utmost to bring
all of this guidance together and ensure it is helpful, relevant, consistent and clear for
Scotland’s General Practices and Primary Care staff.
Realistically this is not the last word on national guidance. New operational and
planning questions are emerging every day. The Scottish Government will continue to
work closely with the BMA, RCGP, the Royal College of Nursing and other
professional bodies, as well as with Health Boards and HSCPs, to ensure as far as
possible that we are responding collectively with timely advice. The Primary Care
Division plan to issue regular weekly updates each Friday setting out the issues that
have arose across Primary Care in the previous week, describing our engagement to
inform our response, and signposting to any relevant places where further helpful
information is available. Those updates, as well as this guidance, will be circulated
widely across the system and published online so that we are minimising the chance
that someone might miss something helpful when it is needed.
We remain immensely grateful to all clinical staff including GPs, General Practice and
Community Nurses and the wider multidisciplinary team, Practice Managers,
administrative staff and domestic staff who are working hard to meet the needs of their
patients and communities.
Yours sincerely

BACKGROUND
1. Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified in Wuhan,
China. Clinical presentations may range from mild to moderate illness to pneumonia
or severe acute respiratory infection. As a result, patients with COVID-19 could
present to primary care either via telephone or in person
2. As of 12 March 2020 the UK has moved into the ‘delay phase’ of management.
This
includes significant changes to the identification and management of possible cases.
3. Health Protection Scotland are publishing regular updates to case definitions which
are changing rapidly. Please ensure that all members of the practice team are aware
of the most current definition
4. GP practices have a duty to protect and provide care to their patients including
vulnerable groups, and a duty as employers to support and protect their staff. As
independent contractors practices need to be proactive in managing these risks.
5. This guidance has been produced by Scottish Government with support from RCGP
Scotland and the Scottish General Practitioners Committee of the BMA to pull together
all relevant information and advice into one resource. The document will be reviewed
and updated on a regular basis as the situation changes.
6. Any comments or suggestions on additions or improvements to the document should
be sent to fiona.duff@gov.scot
AIMS
7. To act as a good practice resource for all members of the practice team including GPs,
Practice Managers, General Practice Nurses and other
clinical,
administrative and
domestic staff.
8. To support practices to maintain the best possible and safest service to patients.
9. To enable practices to provide the best possible support to practice employed staff.
Including protection of staff from infection, support in the event that staff have to self-
isolate, and support in the event of other eventualities such as the need for staff to
take on new or different roles, or be deployed to work with other practices etc in
collaboration with your local Health Boards, HSCPs and Health Protection Teams.
SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND CURRENT ADVICE RELATING TO COVID-19
10. There are a number of sources of online advice for patients and clinicians relating to
Covid-19:
 The NHS Inform website is the most appropriate source of advice for patients. It
is being updated regularly. Please ensure that there are clear links to NHS Inform
on all patient facing messaging eg Practice Websites, practice texts, practice
emails, practice information screens, waiting rooms etc
Please ensure that there
https://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/a-to-z-of-topics/covid-19/
mailto:fiona.duff@gov.scot
https://www.nhsinform.scot/
are no links to any NHS England resources, which could vary from the Scottish
advice.
 The Health Protection Scotland (HPS) Website is the most appropriate source
of clinical advice for all practice clinicians (GPs, ANPs, General Practice Nurses,
AHPs etc) and practice management. Please make sure all members of the team
are aware of the links to both the HPS website and the NHS Inform Website.
 The Scottish Government website is most appropriate for situation updates,
policy updates etc.
 A number of circulars have been published by the Scottish Government. These are
available on the SHOW website. At the time of writing, relevant publications are as
follows:
a. PCA(M)2020(02) – Covid-19: Guidance on Planning and Responding to
Primary Care GP Practice Capacity Challenges
b. PCA(M)2020(03) – NHS Near Me
c. PCA(M)20202(04)- Suspension of Online Booking systems
d. GP Support Letter – 13/3/2020
 Other organisations such as RCGP Scotland also have very helpful information.
For example RCGP Scotland have published actions cards for use by different
members of the team and have also developed some posters which practices may
wish to use. There is also a template for a Business Continuity plan.
 Information for General Practice Nurses is available on the Royal College of
Nursing Website.
 Practices should also keep up to date with any local Health Board and HSCP
guidance and information and ensure it shared with the appropriate members of
the team.
 Google publishes information for patients where English is not their first language.
11. Please ensure that all members of the clinical and administrative team are updated as
the situation changes rapidly.
INITIAL MEASURES TO BE CONSIDERED BY PRACTICES
12. Current guidance from Health Protection Scotland is as follows:
Triage of Patients.
Primary Care practices are advised to make every effort to triage patients by
telephone to avoid the patient presenting at the practice unnecessarily and
minimising any contact with patients with respiratory symptoms.

Practices should consider if they are going to triage all appointment requests into the
practice or only triage COVID-19 calls. They should also consider if initial clinical triage
and follow up consultation will be done as one call or as two separate interactions.
There a number of actions which practices should implement/ consider as a
matter of urgency.
13. Following the publication of PCA(M)20202(04) - Suspension of Online Booking
systems, all online appointment systems should be suspended with immediate effect.
14. The practice should introduce processes to triage all appointment requests (on the
day or in future). Each practice should identify the most appropriate clinical members
of the practice team to carry out this role and ensure that they have appropriate internal
training, guidance and support to carry out this role. See Annex A for further guidance
on practice telephone triage.
15. The RCGP Action Cards should be reviewed and amended to reflect the agreed
practice processes if required and then circulated to the appropriate members of staff.
16. The practice should review all current booked appointments with all clinical staff and
consider if they need to go ahead or could be changed to a telephone or NHS Near
Me remote consultation instead.
17. Decisions on whether to continue to bring in some patients for face to face
consultations, or consider alternatives such as a telephone or NHS Near Me reviews
should be based on a clinical judgement considering the balance of risk and benefit.
Therefore a small number of face to face consultations may still be required.
18. Signage at the entry door to the practice and on external windows regarding
coronavirus (such as “do not enter if anyone in your home has a cough or fever – go
home and call practice”) should be clear and prominent. Examples are available on
the NHS Inform Communications Toolkit and the RCGP Website. Please remember
to update this signage in line with the latest advice for patients.
19. An example of a practice poster could be:
Changes to Access as a result of COVID-19.
This GP Practice is currently restricting access for the safety of all patients and
staff.
The practice remains open for all essential primary care problems but on the
advice of Health Protection Scotland we have put in place a process whereby
everyone is screened by telephone prior to being seen.
All patients will still have access to the care they require.
We appreciate your patience and understanding at this time.

https://www.nhsinform.scot/media/3003/coronavirus_comms_tool_kit_13_03_2020.zip
Please phone ******* ***** **** if you feel you need require medical advice and we
will call you back.
20. Patients should also be informed through the practice website, social media, texts etc
not to come to the
practice. Posters in the waiting room and notices on practice
information screens should reiterate this advice.
21. Practices should consider the use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter to
communicate with patients and share links to NHS Inform. Links with local community
groups such a Patient Participation Groups, Community Facebook pages and
community councils may be helpful to support local communications and messaging.
Consideration needs to be given as to how to communicate with vulnerable groups
such as frail elderly, learning disabilities and other vulnerable groups.
22. Practices should put a COVID-19 message on the practice phone line advising
patients of the screening criteria (for those who should not come into the practice
without phoning for triage) and directing appropriate patients to the NHS Inform
website. The Practice Administrative Staff Collaborative (PASC) found that when one
of the GPs recorded the phone message it would have more impact on patients to pay
attention to the advice. An example of a phone message could be:
“Thank you for calling the practice. If you have a cough or fever but are well
and managing, please self-isolate in line with national guidance. If you are
unwell or feel you may need hospital assessment please stay on the line and
we will answer your call. We will be not testing for coronavirus even if you have
symptoms. If anyone in your household has developed a cough or fever in the
last seven days, you should self-isolate for 14 days. Please check
www.nhsinform.scot for more information.”
Please remember to update these messages according to the latest advice for
patients.
23. Send SMS (text) notifications to all patients with a link to NHS Inform making patients
aware of the screening criteria for triage and where to get help and advice. Further
advice on the use of text messages is available in Annex B.
24. Implement NHS Near Me (Attend Anywhere) in the practice for all appropriate
consultations. Further guidance is available on the TEC Scotland
website, NHS Near
me can also be utilised to support remote working, although access to the patients
clinical record will also be required. Your local Health Board should provide information
regarding the processes to be follow to implement remote working.
25. Guidance is available for employers and employees on the UK government website.
Patients who ask for sick notes, within the 7 day self-certification period should be
directed to this website.
https://tec.scot/digital-health-and-care-in-scotland/video-enabled-health-and-care/covid-19-implementing-near-me/
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19
26. NHS Inform have developed a COVID-19 Communication Toolkit and screening tool
within the Information for professionals section.
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE)
27. PPE should be worn in line with the National Prevention and Control Manual published
by National Services Scotland.
28. Guidance on donning and doffing and disposal of
PPE can be found in Appendix 2 of
Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Guidance for Primary Care. This guidance includes
instructional videos.
29. Information on the distribution of PPE equipment was issued on 13th March 2020
Covid-19:
Distribution of Protective Equipment to GP Practices in Scotland.
PREMISES
30. The practice should have clear patient signage on any access doors, and within the
practice. Any isolation rooms should be clearly signposted.
31. Practice Oxygen -
Supplies of oxygen to GP practices for use in an emergency are,
for most practices, arranged with Dolby Vivisol. Details of how to obtain refills should
be with the emergency oxygen bag, but Dolby can be contacted on
GPOxygenbag@dolbyvivisol.com or on 0330 123 0305.
32. Guidance on the steps that should be taken if a clinical assessment is required in the
surgery of a patient with suspected COVID-19 is available in the HPS Guidance for
Primary Care. This also includes guidance if a clinical assessment is required on a
home visit. Ongoing management of patients and transfer to hospital is also covered.
33. Practices should consider practical approaches such as:
 Identification of a room will be designated as the isolation room
 Ensure Clear signage is in place to direct patients to the room and on the room
 Identifying a specific time of day when the room would be used, to allow for
appropriate cleaning so that patients can be seen timeously, promptly and
appropriately.
 Enough time should be allowed to see patients, put on and take of PPE between
and clean the room as per the HPS Guidance.
 Ensure one set of examination equipment is available in the room and the room
kept as clutter free as possible.
 Cleaning requirements for the room after use.
CLEANING
34. The HPS guidance provides guidance on the steps that should be taken once a
suspected COVID-19 case has left premises. Contact your local Health for local help
and advice.

35. However there are also some basic cleaning and hygiene principles which practices
should also consider:
 All non-essential items including toys, books and magazines should be
removed from receptions, waiting areas, consulting and treatment rooms.
 Touch screens should be turned off.
 Reception surfaces should be regularly cleaned with appropriate cleaning
products.
 Routine cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched objects and surfaces
such as telephones, keyboards, door handles, desks and tables should be
considered.
 Basic hand washing has been highlighted as the most effective way of
preventing the spread of infection. Hand hygiene promoted by ensuring staff,
contractors, service users and visitors have access to hand washing facilities
and alcohol-based hand rub, where available.
 Crockery and cutlery in shared kitchen areas should be cleaned with warm
water and detergent and dried thoroughly.
 Food such as crisps and sandwiches should not be left open for communal
sharing unless individually wrapped.
36. Practices should review their normal routine cleaning schedules (especially if you
employ the practice cleaner),
and ensure the cleaner has the appropriate equipment,
chemicals, cleaning schedules etc. Ensure that cleaning schedules include areas such
as door handles and light switches and other areas which can be easily forgotten.
37. Practices should clarify who is responsible for cleaning areas such as phones, desks
and keyboards, and ensure staff are aware if they are responsible for their own working
areas. Appropriate equipment to clean these areas should be made available to staff.
38. Practices should make contingency plans in the event of the absence of the practice
domestic cleaner who will carry out the routine cleaning and does the replacement
have access to the practice cleaning protocols. NHS Scotland Guidance on routine
cleaning schedules are available at available on the Health Facilities Scotland
Website.
39. Practices should ensure supplies of alcohol hand gel and cleaning products are kept
in stock.
STAFFING
40.
On 13th March 2020, NHS Scotland published Coronavirus (Covid-19): National
Arrangements For NHS Scotland Staff. Although this document does not apply to
Independent Contractors, GP Practices should review the document and consider how
the areas highlighted would apply to their own practice employed staff, any GP
trainees working in the practice and to GP partners. These include:
 COVID-19 symptoms
 Self-Isolation
 Carer / Special Leave Provision
 Annual Leave
https://hpspubsrepo.blob.core.windows.net/hps-website/nss/2610/documents/1_sicp-lr-cleaning-v3.1.pdf

https://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/dl/DL(2020)05.pdf
https://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/dl/DL(2020)05.pdf
 Overtime and Excess Hours
 Risk Assessments
 Staff Health / Safety and wellbeing
 Working at other sites or GP practices
 Non-urgent Activity
 Additional / New Staff
41. The HPS Primary Care Advice states that staff who are pregnant or
immunosuppressed should not provide direct care to a patient with a possible or
confirmed COVID-19. Further advice is available from local Occupational Health
Departments. Information on how to contact your local GP Occupational Health
Service should be available on your Health Board intranet.
42. The practice may wish to consider keeping some staff away from patient contact and
working remotely to prevent most or all practice staff being isolated or infected at the
same time.
43. Practices should review their current staff absence policies. Consideration should start
be given as to how services will be provided when the number of staff absences
increases.
44. In the event of routine work being stopped the practice should consider how staff can
be utilised in different roles, and provide the appropriate training and support to allow
staff to do that.
45. Where staff are being asked to take on new or different roles the practice may wish to
consider reviewing the practice Indemnity policy to ensure that it covers all
eventualities. For example, if general practice nurses were asked to support the
Community Nursing team to do some home visits would they be covered by the
Practice Indemnity? There are ongoing national discussions on this issue, and we
further information as this develops.
46. The practice should explore remote working options for clinical and admin staff in case
they need to self-isolate. This should include consideration of using their own devices
such as mobile phones or tablets if required. The utilisation of NHS Near Me can help
to facilitate this. Remote access to the patients clinical records will also need to be
available. Your local Health Board will provide guidance on how this will be provided
(eg EMIS web, Vision Anywhere). NHS Near Me can be accessed on any internet
connection. For telephone consulting, practices may also need to have discussions
with their telecoms provider around transfer of calls and consideration also needs to
be given to the process for patients to receive any prescriptions issued.
47. If staff are being asked to use their own cars for work purposes eg Practice Nurses
carrying out home visits, then again consideration should be given to individual car
insurance policies are covered for business purposes, and that processes for
reimbursing mileage / fuel costs are clear.
48. Guidance for GPs is available on the GMC Website
49. Guidance for General Practice Nurses is available on the RCN website.
https://www.gmc-uk.org/news/news-archive/coronavirus-information-and-advice
https://www.rcn.org.uk/covid-19
PRESCRIBING
50. Practices should review their repeat and acute prescription request processes to
reduce or stop the need for patients to present at the practice to request their
prescriptions. Patients should also be discouraged from requesting prescriptions over
the telephone to ensure that practice phone lines are not blocked with non-urgent
requests. In the process of developing new systems / arrangements, consider the
needs of vulnerable patient groups.
51. Practices should consider how all prescribing clinicians could best utilise their skills.
52. On-line repeat prescription processes should be introduced or maximised where
possible.
However there may be a small number of vulnerable patients where ordering
their medication on-line maybe be difficult. Arrangements for this small group of
patients should be considered eg via the Community Pharmacy or a mailbox at the
front door of the practice.
53. Practices should not change their repeat prescription durations or support patients
trying to stockpile - these actions may put a strain on the supply chain and exacerbate
any potential shortages.
54. Practices should consider putting suitable patients on serial prescribing as soon as
possible. Consideration should be given to staggering this work over several months
to ensure that the annual reviews all don’t require to be done at the same time. The
whole repeatable prescription can be valid for a year but each repeat should be for no
longer than the patient has now. For example, if the patient has prescriptions for a
month’s supply now then the repeat dispensing should be set up as 13 x 28 days’
supply.
55. The current process for passing signed prescriptions to local community pharmacies
should be considered to reduce the number of staff interactions eg should one member
of staff collect from printer and pass to community pharmacy.
56. The process for the management of prescriptions for telephone, NHS Near Me and
remote working consultations will need to be considered.
57. Dispensing GP practices should consider alternative ways in which patients can collect
their medication without having to present at the practice.
PRACTICE CAPACITY
58. The Scottish Government published the following guidance PCA(M)2020(02) – Covid-
19: Guidance on Planning and Responding to Primary Care GP Practice
Capacity Challenges. When considering reducing or stopping activity in the practice
this document should be referred to and the local Primary Care Management Team
consulted.
59. This document should also be referred to in the event that the practice is no longer
able to provide services to patients due to an unprecedented number of staff
https://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/pca/PCA2020(M)02.pdf
https://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/pca/PCA2020(M)02.pdf
https://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/pca/PCA2020(M)02.pdf
absences, particularly clinical staff. Practices should work closely with their Health
Board / HSCP, GP Cluster and neighbouring practices on how they can support each
other in these situations.
60. Consideration should be given to the role of the wider multi-disciplinary team and how
they can support at this time. This should be discussed locally with your Health and
Social Care Partnership.
61. The practice should start taking steps to review the broad spectrum of current GP
services to assess how additional capacity might be released if required. Any decision
on whether to suspend or limit services will need to be based on clinical judgement
and on the risk to patients (in particular consider the needs of vulnerable patients).
Areas that could be considered for review by the practice:
 Routine bloods
 Routine BPs
 Other routine work
 Medication Reviews
 Long term condition/ Chronic Disease Reviews
 Review of Enhanced Services eg Minor Surgery, Diabetes etc
 Review all Private Work – routine medical reports, ESA, PIP forms, Insurance
medical forms, HGV medicals etc
 Review all Subject Access Requests
 Lower threshold to issue acute medicines on request rather than make contact with
patient
 Lower threshold for antibiotic prescribing without face to face assessment
 Early supply of anticipatory medicines
 Review workflow optimisations/ document management processes
 Review Home Visiting protocol and any other routine visits eg Community Hospital/
Care Homes
 Review other clinical, educational and professional roles carried out by clinicians
to be stopped where appropriate to provide additional clinical input
 Review opportunities for staff overtime and partners additional sessions
 Review opportunities for staff to take on additional or alternative roles, especially
in times of staff absence
FURTHER/ LONG TERM ISSUES
62. As the number of staff absences begins to increase it will be important for local
practices to work together to support and help each other. Depending on geography
and other local arrangements this could be done at local level, at GP Cluster level,
Locality or district level. It will be important to work closely with your Health Board and
HSCP when developing these plans.
63. Practices should start to identify who they could ‘Buddy up with’. This involves
identifying 1-2 neighbouring practices who could see patients for each other in the
event of all GPs being isolated; or the practice closed for decontamination; or provide
nursing services in event of nurses being isolated or off sick; or provide practice
management or administrative support. Remote working via telephone and NHS Near
Me may be especially useful in this situation.
64. The Scottish Government expects that the Health Board will have to make payment to
the alternative provider or ‘buddy’ and suggests that this payment should be based on
what the ‘buddy’ practice would be paid if the patients from the other practice
registered with them, i.e. on a capitation basis calculated from the global sum of the
practice suspending its services.
65. Arrangements for covering community hospital, care homes and other local facilities
should be considered and agreed with local practices/ buddies.
66. Ideally practices should pair with others using the same clinical system to allow shared
access arrangements. Managers and other staff can cover if required. Consideration
also needs to be given to contingency arrangements to cover administrative
arrangements such as monthly payroll activity.
BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS
67. Practices should review their existing Business Continuity Plans, update and
implement as required. If practices don’t have an existing business continuity plan,
templates may be available from your local Health Board or neighbouring practice.
There are also examples available on the RCGP Website and for those that are
members on the First Practice Management Website.
MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES
68. Community Pathway Model - The GP Support Letter published on 13/3/2020 stated:
In order to cope with rapid increase in numbers of people presenting with
respiratory symptoms, as we move into the delay phase, a Covid-19
Community Pathway Model will be implemented from 23rd March (Annex A),
with patients accessing through a single national NHS111 number. This will
reduce flow through practices, enabling you to do more in your role as GPs to
manage other presenting medical issues and to consider proactive anticipatory
care for those who need it most.
Further information will be available as soon as possible as this work develops.
69. Practices should review vulnerable patients Anticipatory Care plans and Key
Information Summaries (eKIS). This may also be an opportunity to discuss with
patients issues such as DNACPRs, Power of Attorney. Further information is available
on the iHUB website supported by Health Improvement Scotland.
70. Financial Protection -
NHS Employers on behalf of the four UK countries and the
General Practitioners Committee (GPC) of the BMA previously agreed arrangements
for protecting GP practices’ income in the event of serious and sustained pressure
from pandemic influenza. Following that agreement, the Quality and Outcomes
Framework has been abolished in Scotland which leaves practices much less exposed
to potential loss of income in this situation. The Scottish Government and the Scottish
https://www.rcgp.org.uk/policy/rcgp-policy-areas/covid-19-coronavirus.aspx
https://ihub.scot/project-toolkits/anticipatory-care-planning-toolkit/anticipatory-care-planning-toolkit/
General Practitioners Committee recognise that income stability is essential for
practices and will agree a mechanism to protect practices from any loss of income
should one be required.
Annex A
Telephone Triage Guidance
1. Current guidance from Health Protection Scotland is states:
Primary Care Practices and other face to face settings are advised to
make every effort to triage patients by telephone to avoid patients
presenting unnecessarily to practices. This will minimise contact with
patients with respiratory symptoms and help ensure patient safety and
the safety of staff required to support the sickest in our communities
Aims
2. To implement a safe and sustainable telephone triage service that supports all
patients. All patient contacts should be triaged (not just those relating to COVID-
19) to reduce the number of patients presenting at the practice.
3. To implement a telephone navigation and triage service that supports
administrative and clinical staff to carry out their roles in a safe and manageable
way. Telephone triage can, at times, be challenging and stressful for all staff
involved, especially for staff not familiar with the process. Clinical triage should
only be carried out by clinical staff supported by clear guidelines and processes.
The support of staff and their wellbeing should be considered at all time.
Practical Considerations
4. There are a number of issues which practices should consider when
implementing Telephone Triage:
a) What are the different roles of practice administrative staff and clinical staff?
Clinical Triage should only be done by clinical staff but administrative staff can
play an important role in signposting / navigating patients and gathering basic
information by utilising the NHS Inform Self Help Guide.
b) Whenever conversations occur with patients, confidentiality should be
maintained at all times.
c) Whether additional equipment is required e.g. headsets or hand free
functionality that will allow simultaneous talking and typing.
d) Take special care to document all interactions, including the agreed
management plan.
e) For efficiency, clinicians may be triaging and consulting at the same time.
Follow up arrangements need to be clear (eg appropriate date/who/when, and
to clarify if it a remote assessment). Ensure there is a way to flag this in the
system (such as by using workflow). Clinicians need to ensure the patient
understands what is happening next.
f) Review appointments systems needed to ensure that clinical staff have enough
time to carry out triage and undertake follow up consultations.
https://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/web-resources-container/covid-19-guidance-for-primary-care/
https://www.nhsinform.scot/wuhan-novel-coronavirus#overview
Role of Practice Administrative Staff
5. Many practices have already introduced care navigation and signposting by
practice administrative staff through work undertaken with the Practice
Administrative Staff Collaborative (PASC). Practices who have not
implemented this should consider what role practice administrative staff can
play in the triage process, eg initial signposting / care navigation, utilising the
NHS Inform Self Help Guide and symptom checker. Administrative staff need
to gather basic patient information to allow the clinicians to prioritise the triage
of patients, but clinical triage itself should only be carried out by clinical staff.
6. Information on the Practice Administrative Staff Collaborative (PASC) is
available on the iHub.
7. An example of a practice telephone administrative protocol is attached below
(Appendix 1). If a practice does not have a protocol this could be developed
and adapted for use in your own practice.
Role of Practice Clinical Staff
8. Practice clinical staff eg GPs, GP Trainees, General Practice Nurses,
Advanced Practitioners, Pharmacists should be supported to provide telephone
triage. For many staff who have not triaged before this could be scary and
stressful. Support and supervision should be provided as appropriate,
especially when staff are inexperienced or lack confidence.
9. There are a number of key principles which clinical staff should consider when
carrying out triage:
a) Gain a shared understanding with the patient around what you are
aiming for from the conversation
b) Allow enough time
c) Develop a systematic approach (see below)
d) Remember to do what you always do
e) Listen – employ active listening
f) Use open and closed questions
g) Summarise the call
h) Ensure both parties understand the next steps and are satisfied with
the outcome of the call.
i) Document plans for follow up or circumstances when a person should
seek advice.

https://ihub.scot/improvement-programmes/primary-care/practice-administrative-staff-collaborative/
10.
A systematic approach is described below:
11. Clinical Triage Guidelines to support practice staff have been developed in
partnership with NHS24, senior expert clinicians and Scottish Government
(see Appendix 2).
12. The COVID-19 Assessment Tool (provided below) will be updated and
disseminated as the situation develops.
a. This is nationally governed, safe content. GPs can use it and apply their
clinical judgment when using for each individual patient as we do in NHS
24.
b. This is based on content developed for H1N1 so please be assured we
have tested and used over 11 years
c. It has been adapted with Respiratory Physician input for COVID 19 and
will continue to be updated as required
d. The endpoints GP 1 and GP4 we would suggest are for GPs or whomever
they competently choose to delegate to speak to the patient. Appropriate
delegation is a decision for individual General Practices.
Please ensure that your practice protocols/ guidelines reflect these national
guidelines. (Appendix 2 and 3)
Appendix 1
TELEPHONE USAGE (example protocol)
Answering protocol
 All staff are required to answer the practice telephones in the same manner,
 answering as follows:
 Use the appropriate salutation – good morning, good afternoon, good
evening, (insert name of practice) Medical Centre
 Give your name and ask, “How can I help you?”
 Ask the caller for their name, confirm with dob and address as necessary.
 Action the request as appropriate.
 If not a straightforward appointment booking ensure you obtain all the
necessary information from the caller.
 If appropriate, place the call on hold (advising the caller that you are going to
 do so) until you are able to process the request/ ask colleagues for
assistance.
 Speak in a polite and professional manner at all times
Taking messages for staff
 Should a caller wish to leave a message for a member of staff, e.g. a doctor,
staff must ensure that they:
• Annotate the date and time of the call
• Record who is calling, obtaining their name and telephone number
• Record the subject they wish to discuss with the member of staff
• Repeat the information to confirm accuracy
 Once the call has ended, the staff member receiving the call can either:
• Send a message (mechanism for this to be agreed by practice)
• Email the intended recipient if they are out of the office
 For urgent messages, staff must ensure that the message is relayed in a
timely manner, ideally in person. If the person is out of the office, alternative
arrangements for managing the message should be considered.
Administrative Staff Telephone Triage (example protocol)
Process
Patients telephoning the practice to request an appointment with a clinician are
initially managed using telephone triage.
The Call Answerer will:
 Introduce themselves clearly, stating their name and role at the practice
 Verify the ID of the caller, ensuring that they are the patient or they have the
consent of the person they are calling to discuss.
 Ask caller for a contact number on which they should be contacted and verify this
number by repeating back to the caller.
 Explain the purpose of telephone triage (to ensure the right care, with the right
person, at the right time).
 Ascertain, if the patient is happy to share this, the nature of the presenting
complaint.
o If the presenting complaint appears to be an emergency (e.g Chest
Pain, Severe Shortness of Breath, Loss of Consciousness, Stroke),
advise the patient to hang up and call 999. If unsure, continue the call
but find a clinician at the earliest opportunity to flag the case and
appropriately call-back slot.
 Advise the patient that a telephone consultation with a GP, ANP, Practice Nurse
or Pharmacist will be arranged.
 End the call by providing an overview of the discussion and the plan, ensuring
that the patient (or caller) fully understands what happens next and when to
expect a call back from a GP / ANP / Pharmacist.
 Advise the patient that the GP will attempt to call a maximum of two times during
the advised time period and a third time later in the day; if the patient fails to
answer the call, the GP will not attempt a fourth call but will leave a message
where the facility exists. Any message left should be carefully worded to ensure
that patient confidentiality is not breached in the event of someone else
accessing the message.
 Advise the patient or caller that ‘if the condition worsens’ they should ring back or
call 999.
Allocation of Call Back Appointments: for example
 Calls 08:00–12:30:
AM Telephone triage list (09:00–13:00)
 Calls 12:30–16:30:
PM Telephone triage list (14:00–17:00)
 Call after 16:30:
Advise to call back the following day if non-urgent,
discuss with duty doctor if urgent.
Recording information
 Staff must ensure that they record all relevant information gleaned during their
telephone call in the appointment booking comment in Vision.
 If a patient fails to answer a call after 3 attempts, this must also be documented in
the individual’s healthcare record as it may be needed as evidence should a
complaint be raised in the future.
Practices should also document if a message
has been left.

NATIONAL COVID-19 SUPPORTING GUIDANCE FOR SCOTTISH GENERAL PRACTICE
ADDITIONAL TIPS FOR TELEPHONE & NHS NEAR ME CONSULTATIONS
Take history as per usual.
But take particular info about:
Ask what the patient is doing now:
(if child and playing/watching TV, less concerning
than lying in bed not wanting to do anything at all).
FEVER/COUGH/SHORTNESS of BREATH/UNWELL:
• Use the NHS24 COVID-19 Assessment Tool (see below)
COVID 19 GP
Assessment Tool V1.0.pdf
COVID 19 Self Care
V0.6.pdf
• Remember, some patients have BP machines and pulse oximeters at home -
ask. What is normal for them?
• Assess whether they need hospitalisation.
If symptoms of pneumonia
(green/yellow sputum) prescribe antibiotics.
If not send them the COVID-19 Self
Care document. You do not need to examine them unless you can’t tell how
unwell they are.
Shortness of Breath (SOB) – document:
• How far can they normally walk, what can they do now?
• What are they able to do without getting SOB: getting dressed etc.
• Document if speaking in sentences on the phone.
• Document how often using their salbutamol – if using more than QDS this is more
concerning.
• If you are speaking to the parent/relative - it is useful to speak to the child/patient
for a short period so you can hear how they sound - document this.
• Can they take the pulse?
• If cough productive green/yellow sputum and in at risk group (over 65, obese,
DM, other co-morbidities) consider antibiotics unless they are very well; in which
case offer delayed script.
• If SOB and asthma/COPD - give steroids (only if steroids have been helpful in
COPD before).
• Can treat pneumonia over the phone, providing they don't have symptoms of
hypotension/significant SOB.
SORE THROAT – Document: can they swallow fluids?
• What pain relief have they had?
• Can they see their tonsils? If you're not sure if they have exudates then presume
they do have.
• Do a FEVER/PAIN score on all patients - this is easy to do over the phone. Beware
it's only validated for those aged over 3
• The fever PAIN score https://ctu1.phc.ox.ac.uk/feverpain/index.php allows you to
chat with patient/carer about the chance of them having streptococcal tonsillitis. Also
use NNT statistics to discuss the impact of antibiotics.
• If we give out a few too many antibiotics at this time it's not a concern, but equally
don’t give them out too easily.
• 99% will not need to come to surgery during COVID-19. Prescribe by phone.
https://ctu1.phc.ox.ac.uk/feverpain/index.php
NATIONAL COVID-19 SUPPORTING GUIDANCE FOR SCOTTISH GENERAL PRACTICE
• If they can't swallow fluids then bring in for examination.
OTALGIA:
• We do not need to see/treat any ear pain under 2/7 unless they have facial nerve
weakness, severely unwell (despite analgesia), under 2 years of age.
• Otitis Media - do not treat under 2/7 unless very unwell with discharging ear.
• 80% better after 48hrs, almost all better within 5 days • Advise if no better by 5
days/ear discharge/in pain despite analgesia then ring (will consider antibiotics over
the phone).
• If itching or history of recurrent Otitis Externa - consider topical antibiotics after 2/7.
UTI:
If typical symptoms of uncomplicated UTI, treat over the phone.
If loin pain/tenderness but not vomiting and able to mobilise without being dizzy give
antibiotics for pyelonephritis. (The risk of getting Covid-19 by coming to the surgery
is greater than risk of prescribing too high a dose of antibiotics.)
Being dizzy when mobilising is a red flag for hypotension and needs to be assessed.
SINUSITIS:
Treat if unilateral facial swelling with green discharge and systemically unwell, or if
over 10 days duration (some areas it’s now 5 days). They do NOT need to be seen
unless you’re not sure of diagnosis.
Know these time durations to advise patients:
Natural history and average illness length for common respiratory tract infections:
Average length of symptoms:
1. Middle-ear infection 4 days
2. Sore throat 7 days
3. Common cold 10 days
4. Sinusitis 18 days
5. Cough or bronchitis 21 days
For children with URTIs – direct them to http://www.whenshouldiworry.com -
this is a useful leaflet for parents.
If prescribing antibiotics utilise your local antibiotic prescribing guidelines to
decide on appropriate antibiotic.
Direct patients to Health Protection Scotland (HPS) website for guidance on
issues such as self-isolation etc.

Annex B – Text Messaging Guidance
13 March 2020
GP MESSAGING TO PATIENTS - GUIDANCE
Patient-facing information
Please note that advice is liable to change – please refer to the latest guidance when
updating your patient facing information (https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-
conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19).
COMMUNICATION TOOLKIT:
NHS Inform have developed a toolkit containing a poster, video and social media posts
for organisations to print and share.
(https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-
poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19#information-for-professionals)
Telephone system
This message should be added to your phone system. Ideally at the front end (so
before a call is answered).
“Thank you for calling the practice. If you have a cough or fever but are well and
managing, please self-isolate for seven days in line with national guidance. If you are
unwell or feel you may need hospital assessment please stay on the line and we will
answer your call. We will be not testing for coronavirus even if you have symptoms. If
anyone in your household has developed a cough or fever in the last seven days, you
should self-isolate for 14 days. Please check www.nhsinform.scot for more
information.”
Please remember to update these messages according to the latest advice for
patients.
Guidance on text messages and similar communications with NHSScotland registered
individuals.
Scottish Government wants to give re-assurance with regards to this measure. During
these difficult times, sending text messages to patients with further instructions around
their health care, including attendance or not at certain premises and appointments,
is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health (exception point
(i) (public health) on Art. 9(2)).
From the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) point of view,
these messages are not considered to be advertising or marketing material, but
instead they provide further advice or
instructions in relation to their health care,
including attendance at appointments or non-attendance to specific locations, etc.
This is also in line with existing guidance provided by the Information Commissioner’s
Office - ICO (https://ico.org.uk/media/2616882/direct-marketing-code-draft-

NATIONAL COVID-19 SUPPORTING GUIDANCE FOR SCOTTISH GENERAL PRACTICE
Having been shown a few messages that have been issued by GP practices, we have
considered appropriate to issue some additional advice and examples.
 There is an expectation that senders of text messages clearly identify
themselves.
At the moment some patients are receiving messages from a
random mobile number, with no indication if that mobile number can be used
for any other purposes (e.g. are people trying to reply to the message, call the
number).
 Wherever possible refer to a trusted source of contact numbers (e.g. NHS 24,
NHS Inform, a health board or a GP website). There is a risk of messages being
ignored because people may think it is spam or a scam. Please do not refer
patients to any NHS England sources.
 If considering texting patients their test results, ensure the person understands
this is the means of communication to be used. This is important in order to
ensure there is a reasonable expectation that the result will be communicated
in this manner to an agreed and verified number.
 Provide advice to staff to ensure every opportunity is used to verify the mobile
phone numbers of individuals that they hold.
 Use plain English and consider easy read messages that everyone can
understand and is culturally appropriate.
 Ensure the message doesn’t add unnecessary confusion, specially across the
elderly or any groups who may not be greatly familiar with digital technologies
or the NHS services. Do not make big assumptions. Keep it clear and simple.
When choosing the words, be sensitive about the psychological and emotional
reactions that a people may experience as a result.
o Consider an option for those
who cannot read due to eye sight,
cognitive difficulties or with literacy and language problems.
Perhaps in
addition to the website, a recorded message should also be available
when telephone contact is made with the GP Practice/health board.
 Also remember that the general SMS good practice guide (2012) is still
applicable (https://www.ehealth.scot/wp-content/uploads/documents/SMS-
Good-Practice-Guide-30-August-2012.pdf)
 Evaluate the benefit for patients and the wider NHS before you decide to use
SMS for whatever specific communication you have in mind.
 Additional security advice is provided by the National Cyber Security Centre:
Protecting SMS messages used in critical business processes.

 If you have any doubts, follow the advice from your health board Data
Protection Office as well as the Communications Department.
Providing security assurances to patients
 Calling back patients - When advising the public that your service will call back,
ensure risk for spam and fraud are minimised, for example:
o In your website, clarify that you will not call back unless the person has
initiated the communication (first call), and that you will not require them
to:
 provide your financial details or passwords as part of any COVID-
19 communications
 “verify” or “update” your details or “reactivate” an account or
anything like that.
 reply to the text message
 If you think you might have responded to a text message scam
and provided your personal or financial details,
contact your bank
immediately.
o Your website should also include advice in case of suspicious
Coronavirus call, for example:
 If you think you have received a call or text message related to
corona virus that you think is fraudulent please refer to the Action
Fraud website.
https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/alert/coronavirus-scam-costs-
victims-over-800k-in-one-month
o When possible, indicate a time frame in which the person should expect
the call back and ensure this is updated if needed (e.g. in the event of
delays in call handling etc.).

KEY INFORMATION SUMMARY (KIS) GUIDANCE FOR GP PRACTICE TEAMS
DURING COVID 19 PANDEMIC
In Scotland, the Key Information Summary (KIS) software allows clinical information
from the primary care record (Vision, EMIS) to be shared across the wider NHS, in
particular, the out of hours GP service and secondary care.
For those patients who do not have a KIS, only the information available in their
Emergency Care Summary (ECS) will be available to view (ie medication and allergy
data, demographic data).
In normal circumstances to create a KIS for a patient we need to obtain explicit
consent from them to do this (assuming they are able to give consent).
In the situation that we are facing with Covid19 pandemic, there is a strong practical
and moral argument that we should be proactively sharing as much information as
possible from patients in “at risk” groups across the wider system to help clinicians
who do not necessarily know these patients to make decisions about their care,
should they present.
This guidance deals with two separate aspects sharing information via KIS to allow
safe and appropriate clinical decision making.
1.1 FOR THOSE PATIENTS WHO ALREADY HAVE A KIS
For this group, the guidance is around updating the information in the existing ACP
section (the special note box) to ensure it is up to date and also to take the
opportunity to ensure that patients are aware of current public health guidance.
Many will be frightened and so a proactive phonecall from the practice has been
found to be very appreciated
Step by step guidance:
1. Run a practice search to identify those who already have KIS
2. Divide up the list according to who best knows the patient if possible
This could involve most people within primary care team e.g. practice nurse, GP,
community nurse.
Aspects could be done by health care assistant or receptionist
If patient has cognitive impairment then contact better with POA, carer, family
member
3. Phone patient and explain that you are calling from the health centre to
check that they are aware of up to date guidance regarding Coronavirus /
COVID-19 because they might be in a higher risk group if they were to
catch the infection.
4. Explain how to reduce risk of catching virus.
www.nhsinform.scot
- good hand hygiene and avoid touching face
- avoiding contact with people who have respiratory illness
- social distancing measures
5. Ensure they know what to do if they develop respiratory symptoms (cough,
shortness of breath or fever)
if access to internet check NHS Inform on www.nhsinform.scot
give usual self-care advice
phone GP practice or
NHS 24 on 111 if they are unwell
do not turn up unannounced at pharmacy, GP surgery or hospital - phone first
6. Check information in the KIS special note is still correct
check that next of kin and power of attorney information is up to date
If appropriate ask ‘If you were to become very unwell with coronavirus or
another illness, is there anything that you would like us to take into account
whilst caring for you? (e.g. treatments that would or would not be acceptable
to you / preferences for care) and go where this conversation takes you.
Update special note with any additional information
Include the wording “updated as per Covid19 protocol”
1.2 FOR “AT RISK” PATIENTS WHO DO NOT YET HAVE A KIS
Explicit consent is usually mandatory to create a KIS. Often these KISs will also
include more detailed discussion about desire for active treatment and ceilings of
care – as above -
as part of an anticipatory care planning discussion (in the freetext
“special note” box).
However, it is recognised that this is time-consuming and
ethically sensitive work in the context of public anxiety and uncertainty which may
not feel appropriate to do in a time-pressured environment without accompanying
public messaging about ACP discussions and decisions around Covid.
Therefore, this part of the guidance is focused on how practices can generate
a simple KIS (without the fuller ACP discussion) without the need for explicit
consent to be obtained.
This will allow rapid sharing of more high level data
than the ECS allows (specifically past medical history information). The
Scottish Government is providing assurances that practices can suspend their usual
requirement to seek explicit consent and send a KISi.
This is in recognition of the
fact that NOT sharing information for our high risk patents is more harmful than not
sharing it.
It is also what the public would expect us to do to “join-up” their care.
Step-by-step guidance:
Identify those patients who do not currently have a KIS but would benefit from one
This could be achieved using recognised risk prediction tools (SPARRA, High Health Gain
data, efrailty index) or simply by clinical judgement of who would be felt to benefit (may
include those on chronic disease registers, on multiple medications, coded as housebound,
on community nursing caseload, on palliative care register, undergoing chemotherapy, on
renal dialysis etc)

i Consent is no longer a legal basis under GDPR.
All processing is done under
Article 6(1)(e) (public task) and article 9 (2)(h) (necessary for the provision of health
care). Marking consent, however, is necessary for the ECS system to pull the data
into KIS.
The current Information Commissioners’ Office position is:
“In the current circumstances it could be more harmful not to share health and care
information than to share it. The Information Commissioner has assured NHSX that
she cannot envisage a situation where she would take action against a health and
care professional clearly trying to deliver care”

Video consultations: information for GPs
COVID-19 creates an unprecedented situation. Many GP practices are considering
introducing video consultations as a matter of urgency to reduce risk of contagion.
This preliminary document covers five questions:
1. When are video consultations appropriate in primary care?
2. How can a GP practice get set up for video consultations?
3. How can a clinician conduct a high-quality video consultation in primary care?
4. How should patients prepare for, and participate in, video consultations?
5. What is the research evidence for the quality and safety of video consultations?
The advice in this document is based on our research,12 guidance produced by the Scottish
Government (to which we contributed),3 guidance for patients which we developed for a
hospital trust,4 and a brief review of the wider literature.5

VIDEO CONSULTATIONS IN PRIMARY CARE 1:
When is video appropriate?
There is no need to use video when a telephone call will do. The decision to offer a video
consultation should be part of the wider system of triage offered in your practice.
Patients who just want general information about COVID should be directed to a website or
recorded phone message. But video can provide additional diagnostic clues and therapeutic
presence.
Below are some rules of thumb, which should be combined with clinical and situational
judgement.
COVID-related consultations: video may be appropriate when
Ø The clinician is self-isolating (or to protect the clinical workforce)
Ø The patient is a known COVID case or is self-isolating (e.g. a contact of a known case)
Ø The patient has symptoms that could be due to COVID
Ø The patient is well but anxious and requires additional reassurance
Ø The patient is in a care home with staff on hand to support a video consultation
Ø There is a need for remote support to meet increased demand in a particular locality (e.g.
during a local outbreak when staff are off sick)
Non-COVID-related consultations: video may be appropriate for
Ø Routine chronic disease check-ups, especially if the patient is stable and has monitoring
devices at home
Ø Administrative reasons e.g. re-issuing sick notes, repeat medication
Ø Counselling and similar services
Ø Duty doctor/nurse triage when a telephone call is insufficient
Ø Any condition in which the trade-off between attending in person and staying at home favours
the latter (e.g. in some frail older patients with multi-morbidity or in terminally ill patients, the
advantages of video may outweigh its limitations)
On the basis of current evidence, we suggest that video should not generally be used for:
Ø Assessing patients with potentially serious, high-risk conditions likely to need a physical
examination (including high-risk groups for poor outcomes from COVID who are unwell)
Ø When an internal examination (e.g. gynaecological) cannot be deferred
Ø Co-morbidities affecting the patient’s ability to use the technology (e.g. confusion), or serious
anxieties about the technology (unless relatives are on hand to help)
Ø Some deaf and hard-of-hearing patients may find video difficult, but if they can lip-read and/or
use the chat function, video may be better than telephone

VIDEO CONSULTATIONS IN PRIMARY CARE 2:
How can our practice get set up?
Decide
and plan
• Practice meeting (perhaps virtually)
• Involve practice manager, clinicians, administrative staff
• Agree what kind of appointments will be done by video
• Agree what hardware and software will be used
• Ensure staff know about the plans and their concerns are heard
• Develop links with local technical support team
Set up the
technology
• Internet connection (preferably, fast broadband)
• Technology in place (select and install video call software and
peripherals such as webcam, microphone)
• Hardware and software up to date and audio/video working
• If working remotely, ensure home technology meets standard and
there is read/write access to the practice's clinical record system
• Produce information for patients on what technology they need
Set up the
workflows
• Update practice website with information on video calls
• Update clinic templates to show availability for video calls
• Create appointment code for a video consultation
• Put process in place for scheduled & unscheduled appointments
• Put arrangements in place for in-person contact (e.g. collection of
forms); ensure prescriptions are sent directly to pharmacy
• Make contingency plans for what to do if video link fails e.g.
clinician will contact patient by phone
Training and
piloting
• All staff have been trained in the new system and are competent
• Clinicians have all the necessary equipment in their rooms (or
access to a shared room)
• Technical aspects have been tested by making a dummy call
• Staff have tested the process (including making an entry on
patient's record, arranging follow-up, sending prescription etc)
• A patient / layperson has tested the process
Professor Trisha Greenhalgh (on behalf of the IRIHS research group), University of Oxford, 16th March 2020
VIDEO CONSULTATIONS IN PRIMARY CARE 3:
How to do a high-quality consultation
Before the
consultation
• Confirm that (as far as you can assess in advance) a video
consultation is clinically appropriate for this patient at this time
• Use a private, well-lit room and ask patient to do the same
• Take the patient's phone number in case the video link fails
• Ensure you have access to the patient's clinical record (ideally, have
it available on a second screen)
• On the day, check that the technology is working
Starting the
consultation
• Initiate the consultation by calling or inviting the patient
• Say something e.g. ""can you hear me?"" ""can you see me?"" to
prompt patient to optimise the technical set-up
• Take and record verbal consent for a video consultation
• Introduce everyone in the room (even those off camera), and ask
patient to do the same or confirm that they are alone
• Reassure the patient that the consultation is likely to be very
similar to a standard one, and that the call is confidential / secure
Having a video
consultation
• Video communication works the same as face to face, but it may
feel less fluent and there may be glitches (e.g. blurry picture)
• You don't need to look at the camera to demonstrate that you are
engaged. Looking at the screen is fine
• Inform the patient when you are otherwise occupied (e.g. taking
notes or reading something on another screen)
• Make written records as you would in a standard consultation
• Be aware that video communication is a bit harder for the patient
Closing the
consultation
• Be particularly careful to summarise key points, since it's possible
something could have been misssed due to technical interference
• Ask the patient if they need anything clarified
• Confirm (and record) if the patient is happy to use video again
• To end, tell the patient you're going to close the call now, and say
goodbye (before actually closing the connection)
Professor Trisha Greenhalgh (on behalf of the IRIHS research group), University of Oxford, 16th March 2020
VIDEO CONSULTATIONS IN PRIMARY CARE 4:
A guide for patients on consulting by video
Decide if video
is right for you
• If you just need general information and self-care tips, use a website
(e.g. put 'NHS coronavirus advice' into Google)
• You don't need a video consultation if a phone call will do
• Video consultations provide more visual information and can be
more reassuring if you're anxious
• Your doctor or nurse may be self-isolating and working by video
• Check your GP practice's website to see what is on offer
Get set up
technically
• A good internet connection
• A quiet place where you won't be disturbed
• A computer, tablet or smartpone with a built-in camera and
microphone
• Test your audio and video connection and adjust the settings so you
can see and hear well (or get someone to do this for you)
• Check your practice website for what else you need to do (different
video platforms have slightly different set-up steps)
Booking and
connecting
• Make a video appointment by following instructions from your GP
practice (on the practice website or answering machine)
• Just before your appointment time, click the connection
• Say hello or wave when you see the doctor or nurse (you may both
have to fiddle a bit to get the sound and picture working well)
• Make sure the doctor or nurse knows your phone number so they
can call you back if the connection fails
Having your
consultation
• Look at the screen (there's no need to look directly at the camera)
• If all goes well, the call will feel like a face to face appointment
• Use the screen camera to show things (e.g. a rash)
• If you get cut off and can't reconnect, wait for a phone call
• Write down any advice or instructions, and make sure you
understand the next steps (e.g. where to leave a specimen)
• When you've both said goodbye, disconnect
Professor Trisha Greenhalgh (on behalf of the IRIHS research group), University of Oxford, 16th March 2020
Appendix: Brief summary of the research literature
1. A large body of research, most of which has been done in hospital outpatient settings, suggests
that video consultations (VCs) using modern technologies appear broadly safe for low-risk
patients. There is limited research on the use of VC in acute epidemic situations or general
practice settings.
2. The research literature consists mainly of underpowered randomised controlled trials on highly-
selected populations who are not acutely ill. In such trials, VCs were associated with high patient
and staff satisfaction, similar clinical outcomes and (sometimes) modest cost savings compared
to traditional consultations.
These studies have not turned up any unforeseen harms but their
relevance to the current COVID outbreak is limited.
3. The qualitative literature suggests that introducing VC services in a healthcare organisation or
clinical service is far more difficult that many people assume. Major changes to organisational
roles, routines and processes are often needed. Such initiatives tend to be more successful if the
mindset is “improving a service” rather than “implementing a technology”.
4. Our own previous research shows that dependability and a good technical connection (to avoid
lag) are important. If technical connection is high-quality, clinicians and patients tend to
communicate in much the same way as in a face-to-face consultation. Minor technical
breakdowns (e.g. difficulty establishing an audio connection before getting started, or
temporary freezing of the picture) tend not to cause major disruption to the clinical interaction.
Major breakdowns, however, disrupt the ethos and quality of the remote consultation and
clinicians experience them as “unprofessional”.
5. We have also shown that it is possible but difficult to undertake a limited physical examination
via VC, especially if the patient has monitoring equipment at home and is confident in using it.
However, such examinations place a high burden on patients, who need to not only take
measurements but also ensure that the remote clinician is able to see that they are doing the
examination correctly.
6. Limited evidence from natural disasters (e.g. Australian bushfires) suggests that with careful
planning and additional resource, VC services can be mobilised quickly in an emergency.",3ddc1f04-f560-4a9f-8cf5-2a8a523ba915.ashx

Dear Ian
I am writing in response to your letter yesterday about CQC inspections following the
ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus (Covid-19).
In your letter you confirm that CQC inspection and regulation activity will continue for
the time being. Whilst we understand the hugely important role that regulation plays
in protecting patients, we believe that providing GPs with temporary respite from
inspection would be a proportional and reasonable step to take in the current
environment.
Over the past few weeks, much of the media focus on Coronavirus (Covid-19) has
been on NHS 111 services and hospitals. However, it is important to recognise that
GPs are working on the frontline of this epidemic and general practice is still the
entry point for most patients accessing the health service.
In addition to coping with an increased number of patients due to Coronavirus,
primary care continues to deliver business as usual services to 1 million patients
each day. It is inevitable that these pressures and patient numbers will grow further
over the weeks and months as official advice changes and the situation develops.
As I know you are aware GPs will always do their best for patients, and we want to
work constructively with you during the current crisis to ensure we maintain the
safety of patients and the welfare of the profession. We are now at the stage where
consideration must be given as to what general practice can feasibly stop doing as
the Coronavirus outbreak escalates.
I would be happy to discuss this further over the coming days.
Yours sincerely,
Professor Martin Marshall

NOVEL CORONAVIRUS – RCGP GUIDANCE FOR GENERAL PRACTICE (INCLUDING OOH)
13 March 2020 Version 1
The UK has now moved from the containment to the delay phase of response to the novel
coronavirus (COVID-19) and new guidance has been issued (links below). The RCGP, BMA and RCN
are interpreting this in the context of general practice, including the out of hours setting.
New guidance can be found in the links below. Members from Scotland might also wish to refer to
specific guidance from Health Protection Scotland, and we advise members in Wales and Northern
Ireland to refer to that issued by Public Health England.

Case definition
This has now changed, as from 13th March.
People who have a new continuous cough and/or a
temperature of 37.8 degrees or higher should self-isolate for seven days. As stated in the guidance
‘Travel and contact history are no longer important for diagnosis, which is on the basis of
symptoms alone. If people who have travelled do not have symptoms they do not need to stay at
home, regardless of their travel history.’
Detailed information on case definition can be found here (this is the same for all nations):

Symptomatic patients
Patients with symptoms that they can manage at home are not required to contact any service, but
they should self-isolate for seven days according to government guidance. Those who become
unwell, with shortness of breath or other symptoms, or who are not better after seven days should
contact NHS111 online (or equivalent service in devolved administrations). 999 is for medical
emergencies.
Patients with relevant symptoms (new persistent cough, or temperature of 37.8
degrees or higher), according to current guidance, who contact practices or out of hours services by
telephone should be directed to online information
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-
guidance-for-people-with-confirmed-or-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection
Those who have no internet access should be given this information verbally.
Testing
Symptomatic patients who are self-isolated at home will not require testing. There is currently no
requirement for GP services to organise or carry out tests.
Telephone triage and online consulting
During the coronavirus emergency, it is envisaged that the majority of general practices and out of
hours services will operate telephone triage and conduct telephone or video consultations where
possible. Professional guidance from the College is in development.
Symptomatic patients in surgeries (and out of hours services)
Despite triage, it is possible that some patients who are given appointments for face to face
consultations will have respiratory symptoms (new continuous cough and/or fever) upon arrival at
the GP surgery or out of hours service. At the point at which symptoms are identified (at reception
or during consultation), these patients should be directed to return home and follow the ‘stay at
home guidance’ referred to above. If patients are too unwell to return home and require hospital
admission, this should be arranged through the ambulance service and the ambulance call handler
informed that the patient is a potential case of Covid-19.
Patients with viral symptoms who do not meet case definition
There will be a cohort of patients who have possible viral symptoms (eg rhinorrhoea, myalgia, sore
throat) who do not meet the case definition but who could conceivably have Covid-19. Some of
these may be patients with other acute problems requiring assessment and some may be people
who are quite ill, yet do not have either cough or fever.
If patients are well enough to attend surgery
(or out of hours centre), then the following principles should be applied whenever possible
i.
GP surgeries/out of hours centres should identify a location, preferably separate from
other patient areas, in which the patient could be assessed. This should be suitable for
clinical work.
If possible, the patient should access this location via a different entrance.
Time waiting in the surgery should be minimised to prevent the risk of cross infection to
other patients.
ii.
Clinical staff should wear the currently advised personal protective equipment for a
possible case of COVID-19. This includes apron, gloves and a fluid repellent mask.
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-people-with-confirmed-or-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-people-with-confirmed-or-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection
(see guidance below) These should be disposed of as clinical waste, once used, after
each patient contact.

https://hpspubsrepo.blob.core.windows.net/hps-website/nss/2930/documents/1_covid-19-guidance-for-
primary-care.pdf
iii.
All clinical equipment should be kept within this ‘dirty’ area and should be cleaned after
every use.
iv.
Meticulous hygiene both before patient contact and afterwards is essential. This will
include hand washing in accordance with national guidance and wiping down of
surfaces.
Symptomatic patients on home visits
Where GPs or other practice staff conduct home visits to assess patients with possible viral
symptoms who do not meet the case definition for Covid-19, then PPE should be used - aprons,
gloves and a fluid repellent mask. These should be double bagged and disposed of as clinical waste,
once used. Should such patients require hospital admission, the ambulance call handler should be
informed that they have viral symptoms, but do not meet the case definition.
Please ensure that you are reading the most up-to-date version of this guidance as Covid-19 is a
fast-evolving situation.

COVID-19 (coronavirus)
The COVID-19 outbreak is arguably one of the greatest public health challenges of our time – not least for general practice, where over 1 million patients are already treated every day.
The College is closely monitoring the situation and developing practical resources and support for GPs and their teams. We have launched specific guidance [PDF] for general practice, including out-of-hours. This will be updated as the situation develops but things are extremely fast moving so please make sure you are using the latest version.
We hope you will find this page and its resources useful in your day to day work and for keeping yourselves, your families and your patients as safe as you possibly can be over the coming difficult weeks and months.
Every attempt will be taken to keep this advice current but please continue to refer to the latest advice in your area.
Contact us
RCGP members can email our dedicated COVID-19 inbox with feedback and questions.
Please keep your questions coming as they're also helping us populate our COVID-19 FAQs (see below). We have convened a group of GP experts on emergency preparedness to answer these and are also bringing together helpful material from elsewhere to make this the 'go to' resource for GPs.
If your practice has experienced any difficulties in implementing the current guidance or protocols, please let us know so we can provide feedback to the relevant authorities.

COVID-19 CPD hub for GPs
We’re bringing together a range of learning resources to help you manage COVID-19. Visit our new, free COVID-19 CPD hub for practical support, advice and tools to support you through this challenging time. The hub will be updated daily with new resources and information.
Frequently asked questions from our members
Clinical guidance
How do I deal with a patient who has flu symptoms and needs an appointment?
Where possible Telephone / Video Assessment should be a first step to risk assess. Do they meet the current COVID-19 criteria?
When and how do I use PPE?
In suspected cases that meet case definition (see links below) then face-to-face assessment in primary care (including out-of-hours centres and GP hubs) must be avoided if possible. If contact is unavoidable with confirmed or suspected cases then the appropriate PPE should be worn at all times (see links below).
In addition, we recommend that a universal approach is taken wearing PPE for patients with new onset
symptoms. It is critical that PPE is used correctly as per the following guidance alongside hand washing before and after patient contact.

What do you advise for Immunosuppressed patients?
It is likely that those who are immunosuppressed are at higher risk. Because of this they would fit into the category of people who should take particular care to minimise social contact, regardless of age. Current government guidance is that such people should be largely shielded from social contact until the 11 May 2020. As for everyone, these patients should adhere to normal precautions as advised by their national public health body for avoiding transmission.
If they develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19 then advice should be sought from their specialist team. Patients should continue any current treatment they are on unless advised otherwise (in particular long-term steroids).
In primary care every effort should be made to carry out consultations remotely to avoid transmission. In secondary care it is likely that many outpatient appointments will be changed to remote consultation, patients should wait to be informed about this.
Specific Cases
Guidance for adrenal and pituitary insufficient patients
Guidance from the British Society for Rheumatology
What do I advise pregnant women?
Because COVID-19 is a new pathogen, its effect in pregnancy is not fully understood. As a precaution, current government guidance is that all pregnant women should be largely shielded from social contact until the 11 May 2020. There is currently no evidence of increased risk to mother or baby.
Guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on Coronavirus infection and pregnancy
Guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in pregnancy [PDF]
Is there any guidance as to whether steroids are harmful-or useful-in the initial stages of infection with COVID-19?
Patients on long-term steroids are likely to be at 'high risk'. Should a patient on long-term steroids become unwell then these should not be stopped abruptly and advice should be sought from their specialist team.
Advice on long-term steroids from the British Society of Rheumatology
What guidance can you give on seeing children?
From the evidence we have so far, children with COVID-19 appear to be less severely affected compared to adults. As with all patients, children should be triaged prior to any face to face consultation. Every effort should be made to avoid a face to face assessment if clinically appropriate to avoid transmission. If a face to face assessment is unavoidable and a case of COVID-19 is suspected then usual infection control measures should be employed. Extra care should be taken to assess for symptoms in any accompanying adults before seeing face to face. Parents should be advised that the child and their household should follow self-isolation guidance as usual and as best they can.
Are NSAIDs contradicted in cases of COVID-19?
There has been some concern that NSAIDs could prolong illness or increase the risk of further severity:
Guidance from BMJ on Covid-19: ibuprofen should not be used for managing symptoms, say doctors and scientists
Guidance from The Lancet: Are patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus at increased risk for COVID-19 infection?
Further evidence is required in this area. The Centre for Evidence Based Medicine has advised caution when prescribing NSAIDs in context of Acute Respiratory Infections.
The Committee of Human Medicines and NICE have been tasked with reviewing the evidence. NHS England Medical Director Professor Stephen Powis advised on 18/03/20 that in the interim patients who have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should use paracetamol in preference to NSAIDs. Those currently on NSAIDs for other reasons should not stop them.

What advice is available to patients for whom English is not their first language?
Asylum seekers and immigrants will have to be advised to self-isolate in the same way as others. We are contacting relevant authorities about how to achieve this. There is translating guidance available in many different languages.
Guidance from Doctors of the World
Practice management
How can I set up triage systems?
The RCGP are looking to support clinicians who are unfamiliar with clinical assessment remotely by telephone.
Simon Stockley and Roger Neighbour have written a blog post: Top 10 tips for COVID-19 telephone consultations.
What about staff who are pregnant?
Please see FAQ on pregnant women for general advice. It is advised that pregnant women who can work from home should do so. If they work in a patient facing role then it may be possible to modify this in order to minimise exposure. The Royal College for Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is currently working on specific guidance for healthcare professionals who are pregnant.
What guidance can you provide on staff who become unwell or who are following social distancing?
Any staff member who has possible coronavirus should follow the normal stay at home guidance:
Health Protection England stay at home guidance
Health Protection Scotland stay at home guidance
Staff who become unwell and are self-isolating should be supported in working from home if they are able/willing/well enough to do so.
We advise that staff who are following social distancing SHOULD NOT be working in patient facing roles and priority should be made for them to work remotely if possible. Some staff, such as those with severe underlying conditions such as cancer or previous transplant, are at particular risk and they are advised to stringently follow the latest social distancing rules. It is likely that this group will be contacted individually in the coming weeks with further guidance.
Health Protection England social distancing rules
Health Protection Scotland social distancing rules
At what point should I consider closing my practice?
This should only be done in consultation with the local CCG or Health Board, or relevant national public health body depending upon the reason you may think this appropriate, e.g. lack of clinicians or mass contamination.
Staff and wellbeing
Should I self-isolate if family members are?
Current guidance is that if a member of your household develops symptoms consistent with the case definition of COVID-19 then the entire household should self-isolate for 14 days.
Will there be access for healthcare staff to be tested if they become symptomatic or have contact with a suspected case?
The College appreciates there is a legitimate demand for testing of staff to reduce the need for self-isolation. The College is working with the government to make this possible however due to capacity for testing this is unlikely to be in place in the next few weeks. It is possible that a new point of care test may become available in the future. Current guidance is that you should continue working unless you develop symptoms, in which case you should adhere to the latest guidelines on self-isolation.
Training and licensing
What is the RCGP's policy on appraisals?
The RCGP has created resources related to the impact of COVID-19 on appraisals.
Will the College allow me to take my exams?
Updates will be posted on our main MRCGP page.
How will retired GPs' licenses be reactivated?
The College is seeking to clarify how the details of this would work. We expect the GMC to contact retired GPs in the first instance. We will provide further details of this process as soon as we are able to. The college has a late career and retired members group and we will be working with them to discuss how to support retired members who come forward.
As a trainee, if I need to self-isolate, how will I be able to make up time?
It is important that trainees, as with all staff, strictly follow self-isolation guidelines. The College will be working closely on issues related to COVID-19 and its impact on training with other bodies including Health Education England and the General Medical Council. We will update trainees when we are able to provide more information.
Money and Indemnity
If as a locum I need to self-isolate, is there a way to protect my income?
As a locum GP you are self-employed which means that you are responsible for covering your own sick pay, unless you have negotiated this in your terms and conditions. If you have an income protection plan or critical illness cover then these may be relevant so be sure to check your policy. If you have an independent financial advisor then you may want to contact them for individual advice. The government announced in the budget some changes for those that are not eligible for statutory sick pay. For example, the self-employed or people earning below the Lower Earnings Limit of £118 per week, can now more easily make a claim for Universal Credit or Contributory Employment and Support Allowance.
Will I need to adjust my indemnity arrangements?
COVID-19 will likely have a significant impact on member';s day to day work, locality, risk management and supervision of others.
For members in England, the Government’s state-backed clinical negligence scheme for general practice (CNSGP) applies.
The Department for Health and Social Care have advised the RCGP that:
‘Healthcare workers and others that are already covered for their day-today NHS activities by the Clinical Negligence Scheme for General Practice (CNSGP), will continue to receive clinical negligence indemnity cover from CNSGP for NHS activities connected to the diagnosis, care or treatment of a person in consequence of the coronavirus pandemic.’
With regard to the CNSGP NHS England has stated that:
It covers primary care services commissioned under a GMS, PMS or APMS contract, where these services are being provided directly or under a direct sub-contract. The location of the services and whether they are digital or face-to-face will not affect the cover. The particular solution used to provide the online or video consultation is not relevant to the scope of the scheme and there is no requirement to notify NHS Resolution of a particular solution which is used.
The place at which activities are carried out, the status of the person carrying out the activity, the form of the entity responsible for the provision of the NHS services in question and the individual circumstances of the patient concerned (including their age) are not relevant to the scope of CNSGP.
For members in Wales, we are awaiting on an official line from the Welsh government about their state-backed indemnity scheme.
For members in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where there is no state-backed scheme, members are advised to contact their respective indemnity providers should they have concerns regarding their personal indemnity cover with regards to COVID-19.

Dear colleagues,
We have now moved into the delay phase of managing the coronavirus pandemic. This has
serious implications for service providers including GPs both personally and in a professional
capacity. As frontline practitioners you are seeing first-hand the impact Covid-19 is having on
our communities and are indeed a critical part in the front line of the patient management
pathway. We want to provide you with reassurance that we will do our best to support you
during this challenging time. It is vital that our GP teams are visible in leading the healthcare
response and equally important that your resilience, capability and capacity is protected.
We refer to the recent letter jointly signed by jointly by UK CMOs.
As we move into the next stages, increasing numbers of people will be managing their care
in the community, and with a predicted prevalence that will take us into the summer months.
The challenges for our practice teams, our local communities - particularly those at risk - and
our families and friends, cannot be overestimated.
There is much work that needs to be done but we wanted to take this opportunity to collate in
one place some of the things we are doing, which you have told us would help you. We’ve
listed a range of activity undertaken so far, and as further information becomes available we
will seek to inform you as soon as possible.
 The provision of adequate amounts of appropriate PPE which conforms with the latest
guidance published by Health protection Scotland should be with you or on its way.
Boards have been instructed to support deep cleaning of practices where this is
necessary. The College has produced a set of action cards for practices, and primary
care teams are available to provide advice around practice continuity plans, and to
ensure communications are shared with you promptly. We are keen to support you
working with your neighbouring practices to discuss local buddy arrangements which
work for you, and share good practice nationally where we can.
 Primary care guidance has recently been published, setting out clear terms around
ensuring no financial detriment to practices, allowing flexibility to manage workload,
and mechanisms to ensure temporary staff and locums are entitled to the same
benefits as employed staff. The UK government has now announced new pension
thresholds, which should take more than 90% of GPs below the new taper threshold.
This is welcome news not only as it provides financial assurance, but also allows
doctors who have had to stop additional work, or who might have considered doing
more the opportunity to do so.
 We no longer have the administrative burden of QOF, and we recognise that you may
have to stop doing things like some chronic disease monitoring or non-essential
reports in order to manage increased demand. Self-certification measures are being
put in place to reduce the requirement for fit notes.
 To support new ways of working which will help to reduce the risk of infection and
spread, national funding to support the urgent roll out of NHS Near me is underway.
All Health Boards are working hard to put in place the IT needed to help practices to
continue to support patients. This includes purchasing and deploying the equipment
and licences needed so that staff can work from home if necessary, and local eHealth
departments are being asked to prioritise this work. National funding is being made
available to support this. Work is also underway to allow pharmacists to dispense

https://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/pca/PCA2020(M)02.pdf
repeat prescriptions as an urgent supply so patients would not require a prescription
from the GP for their repeat medication. Increased use of use of serial prescriptions
where this is appropriate will also help reduce administration for pharmacies and
practices..
 The responsible officers network is looking at appraisal, and whether this can be
suspended for those on track for revalidation. The recent GMC letter also provides
some assurance around the need for us to consider working in a very different way
during this pandemic.
 Members of the extended MDT will be looking to reconsider their current roles in order
to support the community response to coronavirus, and we will continue to work with
our networks of practice managers and GPNs to listen to their feedback. Additional
hours for practice and community staff where this is needed to help support practices
manage services will be supported financially. We will also be writing out separately to
Practice Managers and GPNs.
 In order to cope with rapid increase in numbers of people presenting with respiratory
symptoms, as we move into the delay phase, a Covid-19 Community Pathway
Model will be implemented from 23rd March (Annex A), with patients accessing
through a single national NHS111 number. This will reduce flow through practices,
enabling you to do more in your role as GPs to manage other presenting medical
issues and to consider proactive anticipatory care for those who need it most. Further
information will be available imminently.
 The Scottish Government has published advice to Health Boards and GP practices on
how they should respond to the impact of COVID-19. We are committed to the
stability of practice income, and no practice should lose income due to being unable
to provide services during the pandemic. The guidance advises forming buddying
arrangements where practices can take on other practice’s patient lists where
necessary. Practices will be paid for this additional work.
 We are aware that some practices have made decisions on suspending open access
surgeries and offering reduced services. We encourage practices to actively and
quickly engage in such decisions as appropriate to help reduce risk and mobilise
resource and capacity as necessary.
 Healthcare Improvement Scotland has taken the decision to reprioritise its national
improvement support towards COVID-19 resilience. In line with this, the Primary Care
Improvement Portfolio has moved, with immediate effect, to focus on supporting the
scaling up of Near Me in Primary Care. It is working in partnership with the Scottish
Government’s Near Me implementation team. The Living Well in the Community
Portfolio will focus on supporting practice teams with proactive Anticipatory Care
Planning activities and implementation of Hospital at Home services.
 We would encourage all practices to be thinking about how they update existing KIS’s
for patients ensuring that the practical information within them is correct (eg next of
kin details). For patients who do not currently have a KIS, we are seeking a way within
existing DPR legislation for practices to be able to generate KIS summaries without
the need for explicit consent, to allow the sharing of past medical history and contact
details. More detailed ACP discussions about patient preferences for the most active
treatment (admission, ventilation) we recognise are more practically and ethically
difficult, and should be considered on a case by case basis if the opportunity arises. A
FINAL%20letter%20on%20supporting%20doctors%20in%20COVID%2019.pdf
helpful template on how these discussions could be carried out over the phone is
available at Annex B.
 The Scottish Government has recently circulated its view that practices which have
online appointment booking systems that do not allow for the safe triage of patients
who may have COVID-19 should suspend them for the duration (Annex C).
We will be in touch again soon.

URGENT - Covid-19 Community Pathway Model – Implementation
With reference to the discussion at Chief Executives on Wednesday 11 March and our
teleconference earlier today, I am writing to request you prioritise as a matter of urgency
your plans to establish a local community hub to provide local dedicated and consistent
medical advice, triage and treatment for people with symptomatic coronavirus symptoms. It
has been developed in consultation with the National COVID-19 Clinical Cell and Primary
Care Leads from Health Boards. NHS24 have undertaken the planning around this at pace
and are geared up to go live on 23 March.
As Board’s experience increasing pressure on acute beds,
a resilient, co-ordinated and
national approach in primary and community care is urgently required to maximise care at
home or in the community and relieve pressure on the acute system.
The attached community pathway model intends to support the move to the “delay” phase of
what is now a pandemic.
It has been designed in recognition of the likely rapid increase in
people with presenting with respiratory symptoms presumed to potentially be related to
Covid-19,
and who can be managed in the community setting. Our intiention is to share
some modelling on reasonable worst case scenario with you in order to estimate the
potential magnitude of the projected activity.
As indicated earlier NHS24 are standing by ready to go live with 111 as the point of
entry for all patients on Monday 23 March.
I require you to do two things:
 To confirm by close of play Monday 16 March that you are able to establish and
staff the Hub from this date too.
 To include the development of this local
community Hub into your Mobilisation Plans
and have this submitted by Wednesday 18 March.
This includes an indication of the
cost to resource this. Arrangements will be put in place to track spend over the
durtation of this initiave.
In terms of core requirements for the model to go live we need commitment from all Boards
on the following:
1. Agreement to go live simultaneously
on 23 March
to ensure
the digital
infrastructure is in place across the system to allow secure transfer of the patient
record and to safety net patients
2. A named contact who will be asigned to implementing this at Baord level
3. Each Board area to have one hub operating 24/7 from that date, with the
exception of Highland and Islands.
Further discussion is ongoing to explore of one
Hub can serve these Boards
4. Staffing from the Hub will be available across the health system and comprise of
an appropriate multidisciplinary team.
5. Appropriate advice from specialist areas will be factored in e.g. Paediatrics.
If you have any immediate questions or concerns, please forward these to the dedicated mail
box set up.

Annex B
Frailty collaborative and COVID-19
People living with frailty are among the most vulnerable to severe illness and death from the
COVID-19 infection, and so the activities which teams have undertaken to identify this group,
and then to develop anticipatory care plans will likely prove to be extremely helpful.
Over the next few months teams taking part in the frailty collaborative will be under sustained
pressure due to COVID-19 and a depleted workforce. Therefore there will be aspects of the
frailty collaborative which may need to be put on hold.
This might include team planning
meetings, inviting people to attend for polypharmacy reviews, or collecting and reporting
upon monthly data as part of the collaborative.
However some practices may be able to use the information within their frailty registers in a
proactive way to target support for this vulnerable group.
The practice that I work in is
planning the following activities:
- Contacting people with severe frailty by phone to check that they understand what
they need to do to minimise their risk of infection, and know how and where to seek
advice if they have symptoms.
- Asking people with severe frailty if they are happy to have a Key Information
Summary, explaining that this will allow NHS24 to be aware of their medical
conditions should they need to phone for help or advice.
- Checking that any next of kin and power of attorney information is up to date on the
Key Information Summary.
- Adding a note on the KIS that this person has been identified through eFI as living
with frailty.
Whilst the above activities fall short of a comprehensive ‘anticipatory care plan’, they will
prove to be helpful should someone with frailty require to call NHS 24, or need help from a
provider of unscheduled care.
These phone calls could be undertaken by several different members of the primary care
team, and could even be undertaken by a well staff member with access to an NHS laptop
who is self-isolating at home.
Please do not hesitate to contact a member of the team on EMAIL ADDRESS if you have
any questions about the frailty collaborative in the context of COVID-19

Dear Colleague,
SUSPENSION OF ONLINE BOOKING SYSTEMS
1. Scottish Government has received concerns from various GP practices and Health
Boards that some practice online appointment booking systems do not sufficiently triage
patients who may be experiencing COVID-19 with the unfortunate result that some of
these patients may present physically in the practice premises.
2. The view of the Scottish Government is that practices should suspend these systems
for the duration of the pandemic.
Actions
3. Health Boards should share this circular with all practices in their area.
4. GP practices should suspend these systems until further notice.
Enquiries
5. In the instance of any enquiries on this circular please contact Michael Taylor.
Yours sincerely,
Aidan Grisewood

COVID-19 - GP guide personal protective equipment
COVID-19 - GP guide personal protective equipment
20 March 2020
General guidance for GPs for using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
Droplet and faecal spread seem to be the primary forms of transmission of Corona viruses. Either direct contact with droplets coughed at you or onto surfaces that are then transferred to you are the principle concerns in General Practice.
Aerosol generating procedures, such as intubation, extubation and Manual ventilation higher levels of persornal protective equipment (PPE) are required.
The PPE required is therefore task specific and does not relate to how unwell the patient is. Guidance regarding PPE Use during a resuscitation attempt will be included in future materials
For most patient encounters where COVID-19 disease is possible but aerosol generating procedures are not anticipated, must involve:
Hand Hygiene
This should involve hand washing prior to and after patient contact with soap and warm water ideally and needs to be facilitated by:
Bare to the elbows
Removal of all hand and wrist jewellery (Single metal ring bands are acceptable)
Clean short fingernails and no artificial nails or nail products
All cuts or abrasions covered with waterproof dressings
Basic Protection
Disposable aprons
Disposable gloves
Fluid resistant face mask
Eye protection should be worn when there is a risk of contamination to the eyes from splashing of secretions (including respiratory secretions), blood body fluids or excretions. An individual risk assessment should be carried out prior to/at the time of providing care
Eye/face protection can be achieved by the use of any one of the following:
surgical mask with integrated visor
full face shield/visor
polycarbonate safety spectacles or equivalent
Face masks for general patient assessment only need to be Fluid resistant Surgical mask types. Higher levels of protection FFP-3 masks are used for aerosol generating procedures and need to be fit tested ideally. It is not anticipated that these will be needed in most General practice situations.
Once worn masks should not be touched and should be changed if they become damp or damaged.

Top 10 tips for COVID 19 telephone consultations
Top 10 tips for COVID-19 telephone consultations
19 March 2020
These top tips are for clinicians conducting telephone consultations to assess and advise patients concerned they may have COVID-19 (Coronavirus).
Pre-planning
1. Choose a good time for making the calls.
Calls under these circumstances can be stressful. For everyone’s sake, try not to squeeze them in at a time during the day when you are already under more than usual pressure.
Consider using a checklist of questions or a template to guide and record your conversation.
Beginning the conversation
2. Establish early on who you are talking to and what the purpose of the call is.
Are you talking to the patient, or to a relative or carer? (If it’s not the patient, remember there may be issues of confidentiality.)
You could say something like:
Let me see if I have got this right – you are worried that you may have Coronavirus? … OK, in that case I’ll need ask you for a bit more information.”
Try not to let the call sound routine or a chore. Patients are more likely to accept reassurance or follow advice if the conversation feels ‘personal’.
Information needed
3. Check where the patient is at the moment.
They may not be at the address you think they are, and this could be important if they need to be seen or are acutely unwell.
4. What are the symptoms?
Are they consistent with Coronavirus?
Does the patient have any pre-existing conditions such as COPD or asthma that could be causing the symptoms, or that could place the patient at increased risk of deterioration?
Do they have any facilities for taking temperature, measuring pulse, peak flow, blood sugar or other relevant physiology?
5. Actively ask about specific signs of deterioration.
Is the patient able to go about their normal activities? Have they stopped doing anything they usually do? Or are they well enough to do most of their usual daily activities?
When talking, does the patient sound breathless or unable to complete sentences without pausing for breath?
Take the concerns of parents or family seriously. They are in the best position to know if a child or loved one is behaving ‘uncharacteristically unwell’, i.e. not in the way they usually do when they’re ill.
Decide if telephone management is appropriate
6. Telephone management is appropriate if, and only if:
the diagnosis is fairly clear;
the duration of illness is short (Most patients should show some improvement over a 7-day period);
there are no ‘red flags’, and the patient seems in reasonable condition, and
the caller is willing to accept reassurance and advice.
7. Give clear advice about staying at home
It is worth having in front of you an up-to-date print-out of the Government’s ‘stay at home’ guidance.
You could also offer to send this link to the patient by text or email.
In summary, the advice is:
Stay at home for 7 days.
As far as possible, keep a distance from other people in the house.
Wash hands regularly with soap and water for 20 seconds, or use hand sanitiser
Take symptomatic remedies such as paracetamol.
8. Check what other medications the patient is currently taking
This is in case any might need to be altered or suspended during a period of fever and possible dehydration e.g. metformin, ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, diuretics or steroids. Familiarise yourself with the Sick Day Rules, and offer to call the patient back later if you need to double-check your advice.
Safety Netting
9. Always give clear safety netting advice, explaining what would be signs of getting worse, and what to do in that event
You could say something like:
Let me tell you what signs to look out for, that might indicate things were getting worse. If you start to:
become significantly breathless,
or develop pains in your chest,
or become pale and clammy ‘like someone who is about to vomit”,
or seem muddled or confused
‘then you should seek urgent medical advice.’
Finally, ask ‘Do you have any questions about what I’ve told you?’
Face to Face consultations.
10. These should be used where there is diagnostic uncertainty either about the cause or the severity of the symptoms.
Make sure you know what the arrangements are for doing this in your practice or service, and how patients are to be segregated or isolated. If the patient needs to be seen face to face, tell them what to expect.

COVID-19 (coronavirus)
The COVID-19 outbreak is arguably one of the greatest public health challenges of our time – not least for general practice, where over 1 million patients are already treated every day.
The College is closely monitoring the situation and developing practical resources and support for GPs and their teams. We have launched specific guidance [PDF] for general practice, including out-of-hours. This will be updated as the situation develops but things are extremely fast moving so please make sure you are using the latest version.
We hope you will find this page and its resources useful in your day to day work and for keeping yourselves, your families and your patients as safe as you possibly can be over the coming difficult weeks and months.
Every attempt will be taken to keep this advice current but please continue to refer to the latest advice in your area.
Contact us
RCGP members can email our dedicated COVID-19 inbox with feedback and questions.
Please keep your questions coming as they're also helping us populate our COVID-19 FAQs (see below). We have convened a group of GP experts on emergency preparedness to answer these and are also bringing together helpful material from elsewhere to make this the 'go to' resource for GPs.
If your practice has experienced any difficulties in implementing the current guidance or protocols, please let us know so we can provide feedback to the relevant authorities.
Email: Covid19@rcgp.org.uk

COVID-19 CPD hub for GPs
We’re bringing together a range of learning resources to help you manage COVID-19. Visit our new, free COVID-19 CPD hub for practical support, advice and tools to support you through this challenging time. The hub will be updated daily with new resources and information.
Frequently asked questions from our members
Clinical guidance
How do I deal with a patient who has flu symptoms and needs an appointment?
Where possible Telephone / Video Assessment should be a first step to risk assess. Do they meet the current COVID-19 criteria?
When and how do I use PPE?
In suspected cases that meet case definition (see links below) then face-to-face assessment in primary care (including out-of-hours centres and GP hubs) must be avoided if possible. If contact is unavoidable with confirmed or suspected cases then the appropriate PPE should be worn at all times (see links below).
In addition, we recommend that a universal approach is taken wearing PPE for patients with new onset
symptoms. It is critical that PPE is used correctly as per the following guidance alongside hand washing before and after patient contact.

What do you advise for Immunosuppressed patients?
It is likely that those who are immunosuppressed are at higher risk. Because of this they would fit into the category of people who should take particular care to minimise social contact, regardless of age. Current government guidance is that such people should be largely shielded from social contact until the 11 May 2020. As for everyone, these patients should adhere to normal precautions as advised by their national public health body for avoiding transmission.
If they develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19 then advice should be sought from their specialist team. Patients should continue any current treatment they are on unless advised otherwise (in particular long-term steroids).
In primary care every effort should be made to carry out consultations remotely to avoid transmission. In secondary care it is likely that many outpatient appointments will be changed to remote consultation, patients should wait to be informed about this.
Specific Cases
Guidance for adrenal and pituitary insufficient patients
Guidance from the British Society for Rheumatology
What do I advise pregnant women?
Because COVID-19 is a new pathogen, its effect in pregnancy is not fully understood. As a precaution, current government guidance is that all pregnant women should be largely shielded from social contact until the 11 May 2020. There is currently no evidence of increased risk to mother or baby.
Guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on Coronavirus infection and pregnancy
Guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in pregnancy [PDF]
Is there any guidance as to whether steroids are harmful-or useful-in the initial stages of infection with COVID-19?
Patients on long-term steroids are likely to be at 'high risk'. Should a patient on long-term steroids become unwell then these should not be stopped abruptly and advice should be sought from their specialist team.
Advice on long-term steroids from the British Society of Rheumatology
What guidance can you give on seeing children?
From the evidence we have so far, children with COVID-19 appear to be less severely affected compared to adults. As with all patients, children should be triaged prior to any face to face consultation. Every effort should be made to avoid a face to face assessment if clinically appropriate to avoid transmission. If a face to face assessment is unavoidable and a case of COVID-19 is suspected then usual infection control measures should be employed. Extra care should be taken to assess for symptoms in any accompanying adults before seeing face to face. Parents should be advised that the child and their household should follow self-isolation guidance as usual and as best they can.
Are NSAIDs contradicted in cases of COVID-19?
There has been some concern that NSAIDs could prolong illness or increase the risk of further severity:
Guidance from BMJ on Covid-19: ibuprofen should not be used for managing symptoms, say doctors and scientists
Guidance from The Lancet: Are patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus at increased risk for COVID-19 infection?
Further evidence is required in this area. The Centre for Evidence Based Medicine has advised caution when prescribing NSAIDs in context of Acute Respiratory Infections.
The Committee of Human Medicines and NICE have been tasked with reviewing the evidence. NHS England Medical Director Professor Stephen Powis advised on 18/03/20 that in the interim patients who have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should use paracetamol in preference to NSAIDs. Those currently on NSAIDs for other reasons should not stop them.
The consultation
How can I set up video consultations?
Guidance from Oxford COVID-19 Evidence Service
Download the Video consultations: information for GPs from the University of Oxford [PDF]
What advice is available to patients for whom English is not their first language?
Asylum seekers and immigrants will have to be advised to self-isolate in the same way as others. We are contacting relevant authorities about how to achieve this. There is translating guidance available in many different languages.
Guidance from Doctors of the World
Practice management
How can I set up triage systems?
The RCGP are looking to support clinicians who are unfamiliar with clinical assessment remotely by telephone.
Simon Stockley and Roger Neighbour have written a blog post: Top 10 tips for COVID-19 telephone consultations.
What about staff who are pregnant?
Please see FAQ on pregnant women for general advice. It is advised that pregnant women who can work from home should do so. If they work in a patient facing role then it may be possible to modify this in order to minimise exposure. The Royal College for Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is currently working on specific guidance for healthcare professionals who are pregnant.
What guidance can you provide on staff who become unwell or who are following social distancing?
Any staff member who has possible coronavirus should follow the normal stay at home guidance:
Health Protection England stay at home guidance
Health Protection Scotland stay at home guidance
Staff who become unwell and are self-isolating should be supported in working from home if they are able/willing/well enough to do so.
We advise that staff who are following social distancing SHOULD NOT be working in patient facing roles and priority should be made for them to work remotely if possible. Some staff, such as those with severe underlying conditions such as cancer or previous transplant, are at particular risk and they are advised to stringently follow the latest social distancing rules. It is likely that this group will be contacted individually in the coming weeks with further guidance.
Health Protection England social distancing rules
Health Protection Scotland social distancing rules
At what point should I consider closing my practice?
This should only be done in consultation with the local CCG or Health Board, or relevant national public health body depending upon the reason you may think this appropriate, e.g. lack of clinicians or mass contamination.
Staff and wellbeing
Should I self-isolate if family members are?
Current guidance is that if a member of your household develops symptoms consistent with the case definition of COVID-19 then the entire household should self-isolate for 14 days.
Will there be access for healthcare staff to be tested if they become symptomatic or have contact with a suspected case?
The College appreciates there is a legitimate demand for testing of staff to reduce the need for self-isolation. The College is working with the government to make this possible however due to capacity for testing this is unlikely to be in place in the next few weeks. It is possible that a new point of care test may become available in the future. Current guidance is that you should continue working unless you develop symptoms, in which case you should adhere to the latest guidelines on self-isolation.
Training and licensing
What is the RCGP's policy on appraisals?
The RCGP has created resources related to the impact of COVID-19 on appraisals.
Will the College allow me to take my exams?
Updates will be posted on our main MRCGP page.
How will retired GPs' licenses be reactivated?
The College is seeking to clarify how the details of this would work. We expect the GMC to contact retired GPs in the first instance. We will provide further details of this process as soon as we are able to. The college has a late career and retired members group and we will be working with them to discuss how to support retired members who come forward.
As a trainee, if I need to self-isolate, how will I be able to make up time?
It is important that trainees, as with all staff, strictly follow self-isolation guidelines. The College will be working closely on issues related to COVID-19 and its impact on training with other bodies including Health Education England and the General Medical Council. We will update trainees when we are able to provide more information.
Money and Indemnity
If as a locum I need to self-isolate, is there a way to protect my income?
As a locum GP you are self-employed which means that you are responsible for covering your own sick pay, unless you have negotiated this in your terms and conditions. If you have an income protection plan or critical illness cover then these may be relevant so be sure to check your policy. If you have an independent financial advisor then you may want to contact them for individual advice. The government announced in the budget some changes for those that are not eligible for statutory sick pay. For example, the self-employed or people earning below the Lower Earnings Limit of £118 per week, can now more easily make a claim for Universal Credit or Contributory Employment and Support Allowance.
Will I need to adjust my indemnity arrangements?
COVID-19 will likely have a significant impact on member';s day to day work, locality, risk management and supervision of others.
For members in England, the Government’s state-backed clinical negligence scheme for general practice (CNSGP) applies.
The Department for Health and Social Care have advised the RCGP that:
‘Healthcare workers and others that are already covered for their day-today NHS activities by the Clinical Negligence Scheme for General Practice (CNSGP), will continue to receive clinical negligence indemnity cover from CNSGP for NHS activities connected to the diagnosis, care or treatment of a person in consequence of the coronavirus pandemic.’
With regard to the CNSGP NHS England has stated that:
It covers primary care services commissioned under a GMS, PMS or APMS contract, where these services are being provided directly or under a direct sub-contract. The location of the services and whether they are digital or face-to-face will not affect the cover. The particular solution used to provide the online or video consultation is not relevant to the scope of the scheme and there is no requirement to notify NHS Resolution of a particular solution which is used.
The place at which activities are carried out, the status of the person carrying out the activity, the form of the entity responsible for the provision of the NHS services in question and the individual circumstances of the patient concerned (including their age) are not relevant to the scope of CNSGP.
For members in Wales, we are awaiting on an official line from the Welsh government about their state-backed indemnity scheme.
For members in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where there is no state-backed scheme, members are advised to contact their respective indemnity providers should they have concerns regarding their personal indemnity cover with regards to COVID-19.
