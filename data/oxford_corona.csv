Here we examine one of them: the possibility that the β-coronavirus that causes \nCOVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 (also called 2019-nCoV) can affect the eyes, causing conjunctivitis \nand—perhaps whether there is conjunctivitis or not—having the potential to transmit the \nvirus via ocular fluids. \n\nSARS-COV-2 is an encapsulated single-stranded RNA virus \nthat has a spike glycoprotein, which interacts with a receptor-\nbinding domain. The receptor is angiotensin-converting \nenzyme 2 (ACE-2), which is expressed in the membranes of \nmany cells in the body, including the respiratory, renal, and \nintestinal tracts, and on cardiac and immune cells. SARS-CoV-\n2 has been detected in blood, sputum, urine, faeces, and \nrespiratory secretions from infected patients. ACE-2 has been \ndemonstrated in aqueous humour and retina, but not on \nconjunctival or corneal epithelia. \n\nCoronavirus, bound to its receptor on the cell surface, is \ninternalized by endocytosis, replicates, and is released to infect \nfurther cells. Infection can lead to cytokine dysregulation, which \nis responsible for the potentially fatal acute respiratory illness. \n\nViruses that cause respiratory illnesses can also cause ocular \ncomplications in infected individuals and can establish \nrespiratory infections after ocular exposure. For example, in \nferrets aerosols of influenza viruses can mediate respiratory \n\ntransmission of the virus to healthy animals. \n\nSome coronaviruses are reported to cause conjunctivitis in humans. However, the receptor-\nbinding domain is not the same for all coronaviruses, so this provides insufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 will be transmissible through the conjunctiva. SARS-CoV-1 \n(formerly SARS-CoV) does bind to ACE-2, and appears to infect similar cell lines in vitro. \nSince ACE-2 receptors have not been demonstrated in the conjunctiva or cornea, \ntransmission from droplet spread may occur when viral particles in tears are drained through \nthe nasolacrimal duct into the respiratory tract. \n\nSARS-CoV-1 \n\nSARS-CoV-1 virus was not detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction \n(RT-PCR) or isolated by viral culture from tears or conjunctival scrapings obtained from 20 \npatients with SARS-CoV-1 infection during the Hong Kong outbreak in 2003. On the other \nhand, tear samples were positive for viral RNA during the first nine days of their illness in \nthree of 36 patients with SARS-CoV-1 infection in Singapore. \n\nSARS-CoV-2 \n\nA study of conjunctival swabs from patients with COVID-19 but without ocular symptoms \nyielded one clear positive result for viral RNA, and two probably positive results. In 31 \npatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, nine of whom were severely affected, samples of tears \n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51403795\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630917/\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s11684-020-0754-0\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762997\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28367520\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23471620\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23471620\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4136304/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4136304/\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/11/8/05-0110_article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32189463\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1772218/\nhttps://bjo.bmj.com/content/88/7/861\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20021956v1\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.25725\n\n\nand conjunctival secretions gave positive results by RT-PCR in only one patient, who had \nconjunctivitis. \n\nThere have also been anecdotal reports of a doctor who had cared for patients with COVID-\n19, and who developed conjunctivitis “several days before the onset of pneumonia,” and a \nChinese patient in France who presented with fever, rigors, fatigue, conjunctivitis, and \ncough. The WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 estimated the incidence of conjunctival \ncongestion at 0.8%, based on a study in 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases. \n\nOther coronaviruses \n\nHCoV-NL63, the New Haven coronavirus, was first identified in a baby with bronchiolitis and \nconjunctivitis and later in three children with conjunctivitis associated with HCoV-NL63 \nrespiratory tract infections. However, clinical reports suggest a low incidence of conjunctivitis \nwith other coronaviruses. For example, it was recorded in 6 of 261 cases of infection (2%) \nwith Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Conjunctival swabs from \n5/76 Omani dromedary camels (7%), the animal host, proved positive for viral RNA. \n\nAdvice to ophthalmologists \n\nThe close proximity between ophthalmologists and their patients has raised concerns, \nbecause they are at risk of infection through transmission by droplets from coughs or \nsneezes. For asymptomatic patients with no risk factors, the  American Academy of \nOphthalmologists (AAO) and the UK’s Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) \nrecommend generic measures to protect ophthalmologists from infection, and these include \nscrupulous disinfection practices, protective plastic slit-lamp breath shields, reducing or \neliminating conversations with the patient during slit-lamp examination, limiting the time \nspent with the patient at the slit lamp¸ and considering whether ophthalmic investigations, \nsuch as ocular imaging, are critical to the decision-making process. Both organizations have \nrecommended that non-urgent treatments be cancelled. \n\nConclusions \n\n●    The evidence so far is that conjunctival secretions and tears from patients with SARS-\nCoV-2 infection can contain virus RNA. \n\n●    Under 1% of patients with the infection will have conjunctivitis. They may pose a greater \nrisk than those without ocular symptoms. \n\n●    Healthcare workers should assume that ocular fluids from all patients are potentially \ninfective. \n\n●    Healthcare workers should wear eye protection when dealing with patients who have or \n\nmay have COVID-19. \n \n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.25725\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30313-5\nhttps://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.6.2000094\nhttps://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.6.2000094\nhttps://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15034574\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/11/8/05-0110_article\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6074457/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24786259\nhttps://www.aao.org/headline/alert-important-coronavirus-context\nhttps://www.rcophth.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Coronavirus-RCOphth-update-March-19th.pdf\n\n', 'status': 200}"

Some technology-based interventions may help, particularly those delivered over the internet or via video games.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\xa0\n\nImpaired mobility in the elderly has a negative impact on quality of life and a range of health and well-being outcomes. Calls for self-isolation of the elderly reduce opportunities for older people to engage in walking and other forms of physical activity outside of the home, and may lead to an increase in sedentary behaviour. Increasing sedentariness risks impairing mobility further. This rapid review aimed to evaluate the evidence for interventions to improve mobility that do not involve face-to-face contact.\n\nCURRENT EVIDENCE\n\nHome-based exercise programmes can improve mobility, but all of those tested in the elderly involve in-person contact\n\nA 2015 review of individualised home-based exercise programmes found significant improvements in physical activity, balance, mobility and muscle strength, but all interventions included in-person home visits.\n\nA 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials of electronic health supported home-based exercise programmes for patients with osteoarthritis found beneficial effects on physical function (SMD 0.41, 95% CI 0.17-0.64, GRADE rating high quality) and quality of life (SMD=0.27, 95% CI 0.06-0.47, GRADE rating high quality). To what extent this is generalizable to the elderly population is unclear, as the mean age in studies ranged from 56 to 63. Three of the seven interventions tested were delivered only via remote means (i.e. no person-to-person contact). Two of these (Bennell 2017 and Bossen 2013) used internet-based interventions. Pooling these interventions (n = 303) showed statistically significant improvements in physical function at 1 to 6 months (SMD 0.66, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.13). Though statistical heterogeneity was high (I2 = 76%), both studies reported statistically significant effects in favour of the intervention; heterogeneity arises because of differences in the magnitude of effect rather than direction. At 9 to 12 months physical function was also statistically significantly improved. When pooled, both studies also detected a statistically significant improvement in quality of life at 1 to 6 months (SMD 0.27, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.49, I2 = 0%). This effect was no longer statistically significant at 9 to 12 months but still favoured the intervention. The one study of telemedicine without in-person contact (n = 50) did not report physical function outcomes and reported no difference in quality of life at 1 to 6 months.\n\nThe wider literature on technology-based or assisted interventions in the elderly shows some promise\n\nA 2016 review of technologies to assist seniors (aged 60 or older) did not combine results statistically, but reports that the majority of studies found beneficial effects. Studies targeted a range of behaviours and outcomes, and were for the most part small and with short-term follow-up. One small (n = 32) randomized controlled trial of a video game (open source game Stepmania) found a significant improvement in the intervention group compared to the control group for Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA) composite scores at 8 weeks (F31,1\u200a=\u200a12.706, p\u200a=\u200a0.001), as well as for postural sway (F31,1\u200a=\u200a4.226, p\u200a=\u200a0.049) and contrast sensitivity (F31,1\u200a=\u200a4.415, p\u200a=\u200a0.044). The remainder of the studies were not relevant to the research question posed here.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\tThere is a paucity of evidence in this area.\n\tSome technology-based interventions show promise. To what extent the set up of these interventions would necessitate in-person contact and/or purchase of new technologies would depend on the circumstances of the individual.\n\tSocial isolation is a pressing health and well-being issue in the elderly community and the vast majority of tested interventions include social contact. Some are designed explicitly to increase rather than decrease social contact. In the vast majority of these cases social contact is delivered in person through home visits or support groups outside of the home. Neither of these are relevant to isolation environments.\n\tThose studies that do not involve in-person contact are for the most part small, and their generalisability to the elderly, community-dwelling population is not clear.\n\n\nDisclaimer:\xa0 the article has not been peer-reviewed; it should not replace individual clinical judgement and the sources cited should be checked.

The best-available \nevidence suggests multiple-day events with crowded communal accommodations are most \nassociated with increased risk. Mass gatherings are not homogenous and risk should be \nassessed on a case-by-case basis. \n____________________________________________________________________________ \n \nBACKGROUND \nWe previously reviewed the evidence for \u200bsocial distancing\u200b[1] in our COVID-19 Evidence \nService. Here we take a closer look at the evidence for mass gatherings and sporting events \nand their impact on health and infectious disease in particular. \n \nWhat is a mass gathering?  \nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) \u200bdescribes\u200b a mass gathering as “a planned or \nspontaneous event where the number of people attending could strain the planning and \nresponse resources of the community or country hosting the event.”[2] The Olympic Games, \nThe Hajj, and other major sporting, religious, and cultural events are all examples of a mass \ngathering. \n \n \n \n\n1 \n\nhttp://www.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/\nhttps://www.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/\nmailto:david.nunan@phx.ox.ac.uk\nhttps://www.cebm.net/what-is-the-evidence-for-social-distancing-during-global-pandemics-a-rapid-summary-of-current-knowledge/\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/what-is-who-s-role-in-mass-gatherings\n\n\nwww.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/  \n\nWhat countries have restricted or banned mass gatherings due to COVID-19?  \nTable 1 provides a list of restrictions on mass gatherings and sporting events for selected \ncountries (as of 17 March). It is clear that countries have varied in their approaches and timing \nof their adoption around mass gatherings and sporting events.

It is premature to speculate if this first case had sufficient \ncontact with persons who attended the carnival or if the virus was already present in Brazil. \nThere are multiple anecdotal reports but these lack data to verify.  \n\n2 \n\nhttp://www.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/uk-to-ban-mass-gatherings-in-coronavirus-u-turn\nhttps://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11180796/coronavirus-countries-around-world-lockdown/\nhttps://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/coronavirus-a-timeline-of-how-the-deadly-outbreak-evolved/\nhttps://academic.oup.com/jtm/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jtm/taaa030/5766334\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920300806?via%3Dihub\n\n\nwww.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/  \n\n \nA \u200bpreprint article\u200b posted to medRxiv on 16 March performed a preliminary modeling analysis of \nVEC as a countermeasure against the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan during the period 26 \nFebruary to 11 March.[5] The main outcome was change in the infectiousness of the disease \nbased on the basic reproduction number [R\u200b0\u200b]. Results suggest that infectiousness of the disease \nwas reduced by 25% (from R\u200b0\u200b 2.5 [95% CI; 2.43, 2.55] before VEC to 1.88 [1.68, 2.02] after). \nHowever, the methods and data have not been verified by peer review and should not be used \nto guide practice. As an example, the authors report a “35%” reduction in infectiousness which \nis most likely an error. \n \nWhat impact do mass gatherings have on the transmission of infectious diseases? \nWhile there is little evidence in relation to COVID-19 and mass gatherings there is the potential \nto extrapolate, judiciously, findings from other acute infectious diseases. \n \nA key concern with mass gatherings is the \u200bincreased risk \u200bof transmission of contagious \ninfections as a result of large numbers of people in close contact for extended periods of time.[6]  \n \nAcute respiratory infections (ARI) appear to be the most common infectious disease transmitted \nduring mass gatherings, particularly in the case of religious events. A recent \u200bsystematic review \nof 45 studies assessing the impact of religious (n=15), sporting (n=17) festival (n=11) and other \n(n=4) gatherings. 10/15 studies reported ARI as the most common infectious diseases.[7]  In the \nfew studies assessing infectious disease risk at sporting events (6/16), ARI was again the most \ncommon (but was second to trauma/injury risk across 16 studies). In studies of illness and \ninfections at festivals (music, art), ARI were less commonly reported (2/11 studies). \n \nA \u200bcross-sectional study\u200b of international mass gatherings using data from a global surveillance \nnetwork of travel-related morbidity reported 296 ill travellers, the majority from religious (243 \ncases, 82.1%) but also cultural (e.g., music, dance, carnival) (19 cases; 6.4%), the World Scout \nJamboree (17 cases; 5.7%), major sport events (13 cases; 4.4%), and a large conference (4 \ncases; 1.4%).[8]  Illness was directly associated with mass gathering attendance in 260 cases \nreporting a total of 303 diagnoses; ARI being the most frequently reported diagnosis (236 cases, \n77.9%). \n \nIn a specific study of \u200bIndian pilgrims\u200b attending Hajj between 2014-2016, approximately 50.4% \n(50.3% to 50.6%) of all reported outpatient diagnoses were ARI, by far the most common \ndiagnoses.[9] \n \nA retrospective \u200bstudy\u200b in 273 French pilgrims attending the Hajj in 2009 reported a 2.3 fold \nincrease in the incidence of influenza-like-illness (ILI) compared to a non-attending control \n(mean incidence of 1211 cases per 100,000 pilgrims versus 520 among a French Provence \npopulation).[10]  The majority of pilgrims were vaccinated for seasonal flu but only a lower \nproportion (5.8%) were vaccinated against H1N1 pandemic influenza compared with the control \npopulation (11.7%). \n\n3 \n\nhttp://www.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20035220v1\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(19)30501-X.pdf\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31250774/\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S147789391930208X\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034117301478\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1477893913000227\n\n\nwww.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/  \n\n \nOutbreaks of respiratory disease resulting from mass gatherings may be infrequent. A \nsystematic review\u200b of mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks occurring in the \nUnited States found them to be relatively rare (72 outbreaks over a 10-year period).[11]  These \nfindings need to be interpreted in their context of local and national events in a single nation.  \n \nIs the impact the same for different types of event? \nA \u200bsurvey study\u200b of mass gatherings in the United States reporting on 18 respiratory-disease \noutbreaks between 2009-2016 found that more than half (61%) occurred at agricultural fairs in \n2012 via zoonotic transmission.[12]  Sporting, professional conferences, and religious events \ncontributed only one reported outbreak each. The most common pathogen (n=11) was influenza \nA H3NSv from agricultural events (probable swine flu exposure), with various other influenza A \npathogens forming the remaining. None of the reported outbreaks involved single-day mass \ngatherings, which reflected findings from the previous \u200bsystematic review\u200b.[11]  \n \nA \u200bsystematic review\u200b of 24 studies found evidence related to mass gatherings and influenza \ntransmission to be sparse but available studies consistently demonstrate influenza transmission \noccurs amongst pilgrims at major religious events.[13] Major sporting events such as the \nOlympics and the soccer World Cup detected only marginal increased the incidence of all \ninfectious diseases including influenza, with infections primarily limited to competitors and staff \nrather than crowds attending or the wider community. The evidence for large music festivals \nwas “variable”. \n \nTaken together, the best-available evidence points to influenza outbreak and transmission being \ninfluenced by the type of event, with key factors being the degree of crowdedness, the event \nduration and, possibly, whether the event is held indoors or outdoors. Multiple-day events with \ncrowded communal accommodations may be the links to mass gatherings most associated with \ninfluenza. \n \nWhat impact do restrictions have on the transmission of infectious diseases and does \ntiming matter? \nA large proportion of research in this area comprises modelling studies. Archival studies of the \n1918-19 influenza pandemic in the United States imply that restricting mass gatherings was \nbeneficial, particularly when implemented early. \u200bOne study\u200b reported the early application of \npublic gathering bans (concurrent with school closures) in 34/43(79%) cities was associated \nwith greater delays in reaching peak mortality (\u200br\u200b = -0.74, P < 0.001), lower peak mortality rates (\u200br \n= 0.31, P = .02) and lower total mortality (\u200br\u200b = 0.37, P = .008).[14]  These findings, however, \nconflict with those from \u200ba study\u200b examining the pandemic’s impact in New York City. Other \ninterventions were favoured over the banning of mass gatherings. New York reported one of the \nlowest excess death rates of any city during the pandemic.[15] \n \nA related issue is ARI associated with travel and mass gatherings. Reductions of as much as \n12% in peak ILI and delays of 1-1.5 weeks when >50% mean reduction in travel frequency have \n\n4 \n\nhttp://www.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160378\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5659613/\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160378\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210600611000062?via%3Dihub#b0185\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00333549101250S310\n\n\nwww.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/  \n\nbeen \u200bmodelled\u200b.[16]  When \u200bmodelled specifically to mass gatherings\u200b, those occurring 10 days \nbefore the epidemic peak can result in a 10% relative increase in peak influenza prevalence and \ntotal rate.[17]  Conversely, mass travelling and gatherings may have little effect when occurring \nmore than 40 days or 20 days later than the epidemic peak (when initial R\u200b0\u200b = 1.5) \n \nThe \u200bcross-sectional study\u200b already cited indicates most reported illnesses, including ARI, are \nlinked with travel but not actual attendance at the Olympics.[8]  Most reported illnesses were \nmild and may reflect important differences between sporting and other mass events including \nphysical separation, the propensity to hold the Olympics in high-income countries, the relatively \nshort travel duration of attendees and participants, and the relatively young age of participants. \n \nLimitations and considerations \nMuch of the evidence includes data derived from retrospective observational studies utilising \nquestionnaire-based surveys, with little laboratory confirmation of diagnoses. The significance of \nmass gatherings to disease transmission is directly linked to the efficiency in transmission of the \ngiven virus. The R\u200b0\u200b for COVID-19 \u200bhas been estimated\u200b between 2.24-3.58.[18] The potential \neffectiveness of any public policy on mass gatherings includes the whole range of factors \naffecting adherence and compliance. Finally, mass gatherings are not homogenous and the risk \nshould be \u200bassessed\u200b on a case-by-case basis.[19]  All this must be taken into account when \nmaking decisions regarding mass gatherings in relation to COVID-19. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \n\n● Global data on COVID-19 continue to be collected. They must be actively analysed and \nused to support real-time decision making. However, until this evidence base grows, \ncurrent COVID-19 policies may rely on inferences from other scenarios, such as \ninfluenza pandemics \n\n● The effect of restricting and cancelling mass gatherings and sporting events on \nrespiratory disease rates during pandemics in general is poorly established and requires \nfurther assessment \n\n● Although limited; the best-available evidence appear to suggest multiple-day events with \ncrowded communal accommodations are most associated with increased risk of \ntransmission of respiratory infections \n\n● The timing of restrictions on mass gatherings appears important; restrictions closer to \nepidemic peak may be more effective than restrictions applied further out \n\n● Mass gatherings are not homogenous and risk should be assessed on a case-by-case \nbasis. \n\n \n\n \nDisclaimer:\u200b  the article has not been peer-reviewed; it should not replace individual clinical \njudgement and the sources cited should be checked.

Staggered and cumulative \n\nimplementation of these interventions may prove most effective. The timing and duration of such \n\nmeasures appear to be critical. \n\n \n\nBACKGROUND \n\n \n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government has now moved from its contain \n\nphase to a delay phase.[1]  \n\n \n\nSocial distancing measures are being mandated, including self-isolation for anyone with specific \n\nsymptoms. More social distancing measures are likely to be introduced, including self-isolation \n\nof the over 70s and higher risk groups, irrespective of symptoms and possibly for several \n\nmonths, to reduce their risk of virus exposure.[2]  \n\n \n\nThe strategy has not had universal support. Last week, in an open letter to the Government, 501 \n\nUK based academic signatories and 40 distinguished international signatories wrote that “We \n\nconsider the social distancing measures taken as of today as insufficient, and we believe that \n\nadditional and more restrictive measures should be taken immediately, as it is already \n\nhappening in other countries across the world.” [3] Those other countries include Italy, Spain, \n\nFrance, and Germany, where far wider restrictions are being implemented, including closure of \n\nschools and public spaces such as cafes, restaurants, cinemas, and most shops, and in some \n\ncases restrictions on when people can leave their homes.[4] \n\n \n\nhttp://www.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/\nmailto:kamal.mahtani@phc.ox.ac.uk\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-government-announces-moving-out-of-contain-phase-and-into-delay\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-government-announces-moving-out-of-contain-phase-and-into-delay\nhttps://paperpile.com/c/LfNCJB/RtwnS\nhttps://paperpile.com/c/LfNCJB/svwoo\nhttp://maths.qmul.ac.uk/~vnicosia/UK_scientists_statement_on_coronavirus_measures.pdf\nhttps://paperpile.com/c/LfNCJB/53yOR\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/italy-orders-closure-of-schools-and-universities-due-to-coronavirus\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51892477\nhttps://paperpile.com/c/LfNCJB/qanj9\nhttps://www.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/\n\n\nwww.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/  \n\n 2 \n\nIt is uncertain whether these measures are sufficient, or too limited, as there is currently little \n\nevidence on how to manage COVID-19. We have therefore assessed evidence from other \n\nscenarios, such as influenza pandemics, to inform potential social distancing strategies. \n\n \n\nCURRENT EVIDENCE \n\n \n\nWe found two notable systematic reviews. In preparation for World Health Organization (WHO) \n\nguidance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia (CDC), posted \n\n(May 2020) a policy review of social distancing measures for pandemic influenza in non-\n\nhealthcare settings (Fong 2020 review).[5]  The Fong review “conducted separate systematic \n\nreviews to gather available evidence on the effectiveness of six measures to reduce community \n\ninfluenza transmission”, as follows: \n\n● isolating ill people \n\n● tracing contacts  \n\n● quarantine of exposed people \n\n● school dismissals or closures \n\n● changes in the workplace \n\n● avoiding crowds and restricting movement \n\n \n\nWe also identified the review by Rashid and colleagues who conducted a systemized review on \n\nsocial distancing and other related measures for response to an influenza pandemic (Rashid \n\n2015 review).[6] We used these reviews as our primary sources of descriptive data. However, \n\nwe supplemented the published review findings by conducting a rapid restricted search of \n\nPubMed to identify any other relevant information since the above reviews were published (see \n\nthe search strategy at the end of the article). \n\n \n\n1. Isolating ill people \n\n \n\nThe Fong 2020 reviewers found 15 studies. One study broadly defined case isolation as \n\n“separation or restriction of movement of ill persons with an infectious disease at home or in a \n\nhealthcare facility to prevent transmission to others”. The reviewers found eight studies that \n\nreported a reduced attack rate through case isolation measures. Case isolation may also delay \n\nthe peak of the epidemic. For example, the reviewers found one study that reported that case \n\nisolation of 40% of cases could delay the epidemic by 83 days compared with no intervention. \n\nOther studies also indicated possible benefits, although the scale of the delay varied. They also \n\nfound uncertainty about the duration of self-isolation. Some authors recommended isolation until \n\nthe fever had abated, while others advised waiting until 5–7 days after the onset of the illness. \n\n \n\n2. Tracing contacts  \n\n \n\nThe Fong reviewers identified four simulation studies of contact tracing. Contact tracing showed \n\nsome benefit, particularly when combined with other social distancing measures. However, \n\nthere was variability in the size of the potential benefit. In one study contact tracing, in \n\ncombination with other measures, could reportedly delay the peak of a pandemic by about 6 \n\nhttp://www.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0995_article\nhttps://paperpile.com/c/LfNCJB/iw35z\nhttps://paperpile.com/c/LfNCJB/omLt\n\n\nwww.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/  \n\n 3 \n\nweeks. However, considerable resources are needed for contact tracing, with limited evidence \n\nof cost-effectiveness. The sustainability of contact tracing may become a problem, and the \n\nintervention may need to be limited to individuals at higher risk or in small communities at risk to \n\nothers.  \n\n \n\n3. Quarantine of exposed persons \n\n \n\nThe Fong reviewers identified data from 16 studies. Although the evidence for home quarantine \n\nwas moderate, there was a large enough signal to suggest that it may be effective in slowing \n\ntransmission, particularly with high adherence (e.g. >70%).  \n\n \n\nThe Rashid 2015 review included a modelling study where “quarantining 50% of all case \n\ncontacts over a period of 4 weeks before the epidemic peak, reduced the peak case-load and \n\nattack rate by 25%, and 1.5% respectively and delayed the peak by around 1 week.” \n\n \n\nSecondary impacts \n\n \n\nThe Fong reviewers highlighted the need to consider the economic and social costs of these \n\ninterventions. For example, the benefits of quarantine would need to be taken in the context of \n\nthe risk to other household members, a risk that might increase the longer the period of \n\nquarantine continues.  \n\n \n\nSimilarly, the Rashid 2015 review highlighted the risk of cross house contamination. The review \n\nincluded an observational study in Chinese university students and reported “a significant \n\nincrease in rates of Influenza Like Illness (ILI)  for students quarantined in a room with a \n\nconfirmed case of H1N1 pandemic influenza over those not exposed to a H1N1 case (26% \n\nversus 6%, P=0.02).” \n\n \n\n4. School dismissals or closures \n\n \n\nBy far the largest volume of evidence for any single intervention relates to school closures (101 \n\nstudies). School closures were effective in reducing transmission during influenza pandemics, \n\nalthough the optimal timing and duration are not clear. The reviewers identified two main types \n\nof studies: those in which most students were sent home and only some teachers and \n\nadministrators remained to support children from low-income environments who needed school \n\nmeals (school dismissal); and studies of full school closure. However, the reviewers did not deal  \n\nseparately with the data from these two different scenarios.  \n\n \n\nForced closure soon before a planned school holiday (e.g. a few weeks before Easter) may \n\nhave benefits. Some caution about when to reopen schools may be needed, as there is \n\nevidence of increased infection rates after reopening. Any negative effects of prolonged closure \n\nneed to be considered, including encouraging unwanted contacts in other social spaces and an \n\nincrease in parental responsibilities, which could deplete workforces in other essential areas. It \n\nis worth noting that the effect of influenza in children appears to be different to that of COVID-\n\nhttp://www.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/\n\n\nwww.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/  \n\n 4 \n\n19, typically milder. However it is not known if underlying co-infection is more common in \n\nchildren than adults.[7,8] \n\n \n\nSecondary impacts \n\n \n\nThe Rashid 2015 reviewers highlighted the considerable secondary social and economic \n\nimpacts of school closures, including evidence that “16-45% of parents would need to take \n\nleave to supervise children at home, 16-18% of parents would lose income, and about 20% of \n\nhouseholds would have difficulty arranging childcare.” The authors identified one UK based \n\nmodel that estimated that the cost of school closures could be “£0.2 billion – £1.2 billion per \n\nweek, amounting to around 0.2–1% of GDP for school closure over a pandemic wave (around \n\n12 weeks).” The reviewers also noted that “a comparative analysis of public health measures for \n\npandemic mitigation found that continuous universal school closure was less cost-effective than \n\nstockpiling antiviral drugs or pre-pandemic vaccines, with school closure 14 or 21 times more \n\ncostly for equivalent morbidity and mortality benefits than intervention strategies with antivirals \n\nor pre-vaccination respectively.” They also highlighted the social risks, including the possibility \n\nthat children might be left with inadequate care, be left with under-age siblings, and have \n\nreduced support for free meals. \n\n \n\nImplementing social distancing in schools \n\n \n\nOur supplementary search identified an additional study from Faherty and colleagues, who \n\nconducted a qualitative study “to explore the perspectives of school and preparedness officials \n\non the feasibility of implementing a range of social distancing practices to reduce influenza \n\ntransmission during a pandemic”.[9]  \n\n \n\nKey themes to support optimal implementation of social distancing in schools included:  \n\n● the need to secure “buy-in” between teaching leads, parents, and wider stakeholders; \n\n● using this buy-in to sustain appropriate behaviours outside of schools; \n\n● adequate consideration of the potential negative impacts, while prioritizing student safety \n\nand considering combining different practices; \n\n● increasing the availability of extra resources; \n\n● the need to make decisions collaboratively; \n\n● where feasible and appropriate, inclusion of flexibility to adapt national guidance to local \n\ncontexts. \n\n \n\nAs of March 2020, the WHO have released “Key Messages and Actions for COVID-19 \n\nPrevention and Control in Schools”.[10]  \n\n \n\n5. Changes in the workplace \n\n \n\nThe Fong 2020 reviewers identified 18 studies. Overall, there was some evidence that \n\nimplementing workplace measures, e.g. remote working, staggered shifts, and extended \n\nholidays, could slow down transmission and delay the epidemic peak, although the size of the \n\nhttp://www.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/\nhttps://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/926805\nhttps://paperpile.com/c/LfNCJB/HVmyK+3X2F\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31011521\nhttps://paperpile.com/c/LfNCJB/LoeuN\nhttps://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/key-messages-and-actions-for-covid-19-prevention-and-control-in-schools-march-2020.pdf?sfvrsn=baf81d52_4\nhttps://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/key-messages-and-actions-for-covid-19-prevention-and-control-in-schools-march-2020.pdf?sfvrsn=baf81d52_4\nhttps://paperpile.com/c/LfNCJB/tmWh\n\n\nwww.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/  \n\n 5 \n\neffect varied. For example, one simulation study showed “that nationwide closure of schools and \n\nworkplaces for weeks would delay the time of peak occurrence by 5–8 days”. The impact on \n\nUniversity closures appeared less certain.  \n\n \n\nSecondary impacts \n\n \n\nThe timing of workplace changes, and the possible social and economic implications, need \n\ncareful consideration. The Rashid 2015 reviewers highlighted the potential for considerable loss \n\nof income by employees facing work closures, as well as the risk that supply chains would be \n\nhalted for essential and important goods. \n\n \n\n6. Avoiding crowds and restricting movement \n\n \n\nThree studies were identified in the Fong review. Limited evidence suggested that avoidance of \n\nmass gatherings may be beneficial, but there was considerable uncertainty on the size of the \n\ncrowd that would constitute a gathering. One study reported that a ban on public gatherings, in \n\ncombination with other interventions, for a median of 4 weeks, could reduce the weekly death \n\nrate. There was some evidence of a positive correlation between the duration of the ban and a \n\nreduced death rate. \n\n \n\nThe Rashid 2015 review reported one included modelling paper that suggested that “mass \n\ngatherings shortly before an epidemic peak could increase the peak height by about 10%, but at \n\nother times the impact would be small.” \n\n \n\nThe Rashid 2015 reviewers reported that there was “not a universal consensus from modelling \n\nstudies on the impact of restrictions on movement.” They reported one study that showed that  \n\n “moderate delays (1–1.5 weeks) could be achieved by strict internal mobility restrictions (>50% \n\nreduction in mean travel frequency) applied in the early stages of the pandemic for a period of \n\n2-4 weeks.” However, they cited another modelling study that showed that “weak travel \n\nrestrictions (10% travel restrictions) might actually increase attack rates due to preventing \n\ntravelers transmitting more infections within their local area”. \n\n \n\nEMERGING EVIDENCE IN COVID-19  \n\n \n\nGiven its novelty, information on the effects of social distancing during the current COVID-19 \n\npandemic is limited but emerging. \n\n \n\nSeveral social distancing strategies, including city-wide lockdowns, screening measures at train \n\nstations and airports, active case finding, and isolation of suspected cases, appear to be \n\nslowing down the transmission of COVID-19 outside of Hubei province.[11]  \n\n \n\nMathematical modelling of measures to slow COVID-19 transmission rates in South Korea [12] \n\nsuggested that preventive measures such as social distancing were crucial, among a variety of \n\nother measures, in reducing the spread of the virus.  \n\nhttp://www.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jcm9020596\nhttps://paperpile.com/c/LfNCJB/JAdvu\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32164053\nhttps://paperpile.com/c/LfNCJB/E3wve\n\n\nwww.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/  \n\n 6 \n\n \n\nData-driven models of COVID-19 spread in China, called susceptible-exposed-infectious-\n\nquarantine-recovered (SEIQR) models [13], showed that substantial social distancing for 30 \n\ndays had significant benefits in Wuhan and Hubei. The models suggested that the greatest \n\nbenefit could be had with early stepwise implementation of social distancing measures, \n\nbeginning in the area with the highest prevalence. However, timing was crucial; too early and \n\nthe beneficial effect was partly neutralized. \n\n \n\nThe results of a recent modelling study of UK cases of COVID-19 have reinforced the need for \n\nsocial distancing measures as a package of interventions. The authors concluded that the \n\neffectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be limited and that interventions \n\nneed to be combined to have a substantial effect on transmission. They described a \n\ncombination of home isolation of suspected cases, home quarantine of those living in the same \n\nhousehold, and social distancing of elderly people and others at most risk of severe disease as \n\noptimal mitigation policies, which might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by a \n\nhalf. The authors noted that “stopping mass gatherings is predicted to have relatively little \n\nimpact (results not shown) because the contact-time at such events is relatively small compared \n\nto the time spent at home, in schools or workplaces and in other community locations such as \n\nbars and restaurants.” They also highlighted the possible need for an extended duration of time \n\nwhen these measures may need to remain in place, to avoid a rebound in transmission and until \n\na vaccine becomes available.[14]  \n\n \n\nPublic Health England have also published guidance on Guidance on social distancing for \n\neveryone in the UK and protecting older people and vulnerable adults.[15] \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\n● Global data on COVID-19 continue to be collected. They must be actively analysed and used \n\nto support real-time decision making. However, until this evidence base grows, current \n\nCOVID-19 policies may rely on inferences from other scenarios, such as influenza \n\npandemics. \n\n● Although limited, the best available evidence appears to support social distancing measures \n\nas a means of reducing transmission and delaying spread. \n\n● Staggered and cumulative implementation of these interventions may prove most effective.  \n\n● The timing and duration of such measures appear to be critical. \n\n● The breadth of measures, including “community wide containment”,[16] needs to be \n\nconsidered in the context  of the likely benefit to harm balance, economic costs, and the \n\npotential for increasing infection rates once the measures are removed.  \n\nEnd. \n\nDisclaimer:  the article has not been peer-reviewed; it should not replace individual clinical \n\njudgement and the sources cited should be checked.

Such a strategy may be \nparticularly suitable during the current Covid-19 pandemic where resources may \nbe stretched. \n\nRECOMMENDED APPROACH IN EMERGENCY SITUATION  \n\n● Key equipment includes pulse oximeter,* a thermometer, and \nstethoscope (along with immediate therapy pack of amoxicillin, \ndoxcycline and clarithromycin).** \n\n● Auscultation not essential if overall clinical judgement (‘gestalt’ - gut \nfeeling) of CAP (partly based on temperature >=38, respiratory rate > \n20*** and heart rate >100 and new confusion) is already met \n\n● *Red Flag: Auscultation should be reserved for those where it is crucial \nto decision making.*** \n\n● Assessing blood pressure significantly increases contact time and should \nbe considered only in those in whom it contributes to essential decision \nmaking to admit or not. \n\n● We recommend documenting that on examination a ‘limited examination’ \nwas performed (abbreviated to O/E LE). \n\nRemember: STERILIZE  all equipment used between patients. \n \n\n* pulse oximeter provides a simple way to measure heart rate and can aid the \nassessment of the deteriorating patient. Hypoxemia may influence the \nprognosis of patients with CAP independently of severity scores.  \n\n**Check NICE guidance for all prescribing recommendations. \n \n***Red Flag: Independent predictors of pleural effusion are dullness to percussion \nand asymmetric chest expansion \n\nEVIDENCE FOR THE RAPID DIAGNOSIS STRATEGY  \n\nA 2019 systematic review of 13 studies including 11,144 adult patients from \noutpatient clinics, emergency clinics, and primary care practices, presenting \nwith cough, symptoms of respiratory tract infection and clinically suspected \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\npneumonia, assessed the diagnostic accuracy of clinical features for the \ndiagnosis of pneumonia  \n\nClinical features with the best pooled positive likelihood ratios were: \n\n● Respiratory rate ≥20\u2009per min +ve LR 3.47 (95% CI, 1.46–7.23), \n\n● Temperature ≥38\u2009°C  +ve LR 3.21 (2.36–4.23),  \n● Pulse rate > per 100\u2009min  +ve LR 2.79 (1.71–4.33),  \n● Crackles  +ve LR 2.42 (1.19–4.69).   \n\nA 2019 systematic review of 12 studies including 10 254 adult patients, \nassessing the signs and symptoms that rule out community-acquired \npneumonia in outpatients showed: \n\n● Adults with an acute respiratory infection who had normal vital signs \n(temperature, respiratory rate and heart rate) were at low risk for CAP \n-ve LR, 0.24 (0.17 to 0.34).  \n\n● Normal vital signs, as well as a normal pulmonary examination, had a -ve \nLR of 0.10 (0.07 to 0.13)== factor of TEN, rules it out in emergency \n\nAccess pdf: https://www.jabfm.org/content/jabfp/32/2/234.full.pdf \n\nA 2019 systematic review determined the diagnostic accuracy of overall clinical \nimpression (“clinical gestalt”) in the diagnosis of infection, including community-\nacquired pneumonia, in primary care.  The review included 9 studies of \npneumonia with chest X-ray as the reference standard and a median \nprevalence of 15%.  \n\n● Diagnostic accuracy of an overall clinical impression had a +ve LR  7.7 \n(4.8-11.5) and -ve LR 0.54 (0.42-0.65) for the diagnosis of CAP in adults.  \n\n= close to ruling in, in emergency \n\nIn a review of the evidence for the diagnostic accuracy of the physical examination in \ndiagnosing pneumonia, pleural effusion, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \nindependent predictors of pleural effusion were dullness to percussion (+ve LR 8.7; -\nve LR 0.3) and asymmetric chest expansion ( +ve LR 8.1; -ve LR 0.29).   \n\n.In a study of 278 patients (196 men), aged >12 admitted with respiratory symptoms the \nclinical signs that independently predict pleural effusion were asymmetric chest \nexpansion, OR 5.22 (95% CI 2.06-13.23), and dull percussion note, OR 12.80 (95% CI \n4.23-38.70). For the final multivariate model, physical signs may be helpful to rule out but \nnot rule in pleural effusion. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY OF COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA  \n\nNICE recommends using the CRB65 score to assess patients at low, \nintermediate or high risk \n\n(https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg191/chapter/1-\nRecommendations#community-acquired-pneumonia-3): \n\n \n\nCRB65 SCORE FOR MORTALITY RISK ASSESSMENT IN PRIMARY CARE  \n\nThe CRB65 score is used to assess the severity and mortality risk in patients \nwith CAP.  \n\nCalculate by giving 1 point for each of the following prognostic features: \n\n● confusion (abbreviated Mental Test score 8 or less, or new disorientation \nin person, place or time) \n\n● raised respiratory rate (30 breaths per minute or more)  \n● low blood pressure (diastolic 60 mmHg or less, or systolic less than 90 \n\nmmHg) reverse - systolic then diastolic 90 // 60 \n● age 65 years or more. \n\nPatients are stratified for risk of death as follows: \n\n● 0: low risk (less than 1% mortality risk) (likely suitable for home \ntreatment) \n\n● 1 or 2: intermediate risk (1-10% mortality risk) (consider hospital referral) \n● 3 or 4: high risk (more than 10% mortality risk) (urgent hospital \n\nadmission)  \n\nA 2010 systematic review of 14 validation studies assessed the validity of CRB-\n65 to grade the severity of CAP in terms of 30-day mortality and included \n397,875 patients.  \n\nThe study found that CRB-65 accurately predicts 30-day in hospitalised \npatients, particularly in those classified as intermediate (RR 0.91, 95% CI,  0.71 \nto 1.17) or high risk (RR 1.01, 0.87 to 1.16).  \n\nIn community settings, CRB-65 appears to over-predict the probability of 30-day \nmortality across all strata of predicted risk. The low event rate, particularly in the \ncommunity-based studies, however, makes the precise estimates about CRB-\n65 performance less certain. \n\nHypoxemia: \n\nHypoxemia may influence the prognosis of patients with CAP independently of \nthe CRB.  \n\nIn a study of 585 hospitalized patients with mild pneumonia (CRB-65 group 0 \nand 1) 50% of the patients had hypoxemia on admission. Hypoxemic patients \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nhad longer hospital stays, higher intensive care unit admissions and higher \nrates of severe sepsis, and mortality than non-hypoxemic patients. \n\n \n\nDisclaimer:  the article has not been peer-reviewed; it should not replace individual \nclinical judgement and the sources cited should be checked.

(see end \nof article for explanation) \n\n \n \nRationale \nThe current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the risk faced by older adults, \nwho are more susceptible to complications, including acute respiratory distress \nsyndrome, usually as a result of pneumonia. Comorbidities, impaired immunity \nand frailty, including a reduced ability to cough and to clear secretions from the \nlungs, can all contribute to this complication. Older people are therefore more \nlikely to develop severe pneumonia, suffer from respiratory failure, and die.  \n \nViruses are thought to cause about 50% of cases of pneumonia. Viral \npneumonia is generally less severe than bacterial pneumonia but can act as a \nprecursor to it. Preventing any pneumonia in older adults is preferable to \ntreating it. \n \nIdentification of the early stages of pneumonia in older patients can prove \ndifficult. Traditional symptoms and signs, including fever, may be absent. \nLimited evidence suggests that many tests that are useful in younger patients \ndo not help diagnose infections in older adults.  The onset of pneumonia in \nelderly people can often be rapid, and the prognosis is poor in severe \npneumonia: as many as one in five will die.   The older you are, the more \nprevalent severe pneumonia becomes.    \n \nPatients in nursing homes appear to fare even worse, as they often have \nseveral comorbidities and poor nutritional status and are often physically \ninactive. [5] In-hospital mortality is significantly higher, even after adjusting for \nage and sex.  \n \nCommon causative organisms in elderly people admitted to hospital with \npneumonia include Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. \nLess commonly, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus may be \nresponsible. In severe pneumonia, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and \nPseudomonas aeruginosa are common causative organisms. In community \nacquired pneumonia, the causative agent is often not known. \n\n\n\nOxford COVID-19 Evidence Service  \n\n 2 \n\n \nOlder patients may have polymicrobial infections, which could be a factor in \nthose who do not respond to initial antimicrobial treatment.  Sputum cultures are \noften not reliable, as the microbial aetiology of severe pneumonia based on \ninvasive diagnostic techniques often differs from the organisms found in the \nsputum. \n \nAssessment of 12,945 US Medicare in-patients with pneumonia, aged over 65, \nshowed that initial treatment with a second-generation cephalosporin plus a \nmacrolide, or a non-antipseudomonal third-generation cephalosporin plus a \nmacrolide, or a fluoroquinolone alone lowered 30-day mortality.  And an \nanalysis of 101 patients aged > 75 (mean and SD, 82 ± 5.5) admitted to an \nintensive care unit reported significantly higher mortality in those who received \ninadequate antimicrobial therapy (39% versus 4%; P = 0.007). \n \nViral infections increase pneumococcal adherence to the local epithelium, \nfacilitating bacterial infection. Adhesion of Streptococcus pneumoniae to \nepithelial cells, for example, is significantly enhanced by human coronavirus \nHCoV-NL63 infection.  Coronavirus causes inflammatory damage in the lungs, \npreventing clearance of bacteria. Secondary bacterial infection worsens \nprognosis. Most deaths in the influenza pandemics of 1918, 1957, and 1968 \nwere caused by secondary bacterial infections.  Concurrent bacterial \npneumonia was highlighted as a particular problem in elderly people in the 2003 \nSARS outbreak.   \n \nEarly use of antibiotics in older adults \nNon-response to initial antimicrobial therapy increases mortality, and so the \ninitial selection of antimicrobials is critical. According to NICE, to cover atypical \nand multiple pathogens in older patients with pneumonia and at risk of severe \ncomplications, the recommended choices of antibiotics in the community are:    \n \n\nAmoxicillin with  500 mg 3 times a day (higher doses can be used – see BNF) for 5 days \n\nClarithromycin \n(to cover \natypical \npathogens) \n\n500 mg twice a day for 5 days \n\n \n\nAlternative oral antibiotics for penicillin allergy, if the pneumonia is of moderate intensity; \ntreatment should be guided by microbiological results when available  \n\n\n\nOxford COVID-19 Evidence Service  \n\n 3 \n\nDoxycycline  \nor   \n\n200 mg on the first day, then 100 mg once a day for a further 4 days \n(5-day course in total) \n\nClarithromycin 500 mg twice a day for 5 days \n\n \n\nPlease note there was an error with the prescribing strategy and this has \nbeen corrected as of 20th March -  \n\nPlease Check NICE guidance for all recommendations. 'Alternatively, if \nthere is a penicillin allergy, or amoxicillin is unsuitable (for example atypical \npathogens are suspected) options are oral doxycycline 200 mg on the first day \nthen 100 mg once a day for 4 days (total course of 5 days), \nor oral clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day for 5 days, or oral erythromycin (in \npregnancy) 500 mg four times a day for 5 days.' \n\nPrescribe oral amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day for 5 days (higher doses \ncan be used — see the BNF) and (if atypical pathogens suspected) oral \nclarithromycin 500 mg twice a day for 5 days, or oral erythromycin (in \npregnancy) 500 mg four times a day for 5 days.  \n\n \n\nThe intensity of pneumonia in the community can be assessed using the  \nCRB65 score; each factor scores one point:  \n\n● confusion (abbreviated Mental Test score 8 or less, or new disorientation \nin person, place, or time); \n\n● a raised respiratory rate (30 breaths per minute or more); \n● a low blood pressure (diastolic 60 mmHg or less, or systolic less than 90 \n\nmmHg); \n● age 65 years or over. \n\nScore 1 or 2: intermediate risk (1-10% mortality risk). \nScore 3 or 4: high risk (more than 10% mortality risk). \n \nNICE recommends that anyone with a score of 2 should be admitted to hospital. \nNICE’s approach, however, doesn’t account for the high risk in very elderly \npeople. The mortality rate from COVID-19 approaches 15% at age 80 (Figure \n1).  \n \n\n\n\nOxford COVID-19 Evidence Service  \n\n 4 \n\n \nSource data: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/ (accessed 13 \nMarch 2020) \n \nCurrent NICE guidance requires starting antibiotic treatment as soon as \npossible after establishing a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia, and \ncertainly within 4 hours. This strategy is supported by the results of a US \nmulticenter retrospective cohort study, a medical record review of 14,069 \npatients aged over 65 years and hospitalized with pneumonia. A  lower 30-day \nmortality was associated with antibiotic administration within 8 hours of hospital \narrival (odds ratio = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.75-0.96).   \n \nHowever, this may not be possible within the constraints of an overstretched \nservice in a pandemic. If antibiotics have to be taken within 4 hours of onset, \nthere needs to be in place a self-management strategy that permits rapid \naccess to the right antimicrobial treatment. Nursing homes could hold stocks of \nantibiotics for rapid deployment. Health professional confirmation could then be \nused to facilitate timely self-prescribing for those most at risk. Using clinical \nscore might prove problematic if the decision to start medication is taken by the \npatient. A simple alternative strategy could be used. For example, inability to \nperform a number of acts of daily living were found to be significant predictors of \nUTI in older adults: \n \nExamination strategy \nThe least amount of equipment that is clinically appropriate should be used to \nassess a patient who might have COVID-19. This should include a pulse \noximeter, a thermometer, and a stethoscope. The current criteria for diagnosing \nCOVID-19 incudes recent onset fever and/or persistent coughing. If measured \ntemperature >37.8. The ‘eyeball’ test, incorporating information on temperature, \noxygen saturation, and pulse rate, should be sufficient to assess severity and \ncut down significantly on contact time. \n\n\n\nOxford COVID-19 Evidence Service  \n\n 5 \n\nThe absence of any individual chest examination finding has little effect on the \nprobability of diagnosing pneumonia. Assessing blood pressure significantly \nincreases contact time and should be considered only in those in whom it \ncontributes to the decision to admit or not. We recommend documenting that a \n‘limited examination’ was performed. \n \nIn assessing patients, carry antibiotics in a pre-sealed bag, to cut down entry \nand exit times from the person’s home or nursing home.  \n \nCOVID Monitoring Service (CMS) \nPatients at high risk deemed to be managed at home require monitoring, to \nensure that they do not deteriorate. This is essential for nursing homes, where \nthe potential for further spread in their patient population is significant. \nTelephone monitoring services can follow up patients to determine whether \ndeterioration occurs, and to detect spread in nursing homes. \n \nBased on evolving NHS England guidance we recommend the following \npathways  \n \nCategory 1: May require admission \nWhen it is uncertain that safe care can be provided in the community and the \npatient is deteriorating. \nClinical pathway:  Start antibiotics immediately; discuss management with a \ndesignated hospital admitting consultant. \n \nCategory 2: Home isolation with active health monitoring \nHigher risk group for severe COVID-19, with stable illness that can be managed \nin the community. \nClinical pathway: Signs of bacterial pneumonia--start antibiotics; active  health \nmonitoring (every other day calls and symptom monitoring) and point of contact \nif deteriorates.  Nursing homes with active cases--daily calls to monitor \nindividuals and case progression; patients should remain in isolation until 5 \ndays after resolution of symptoms. \n  \nCategory 3: Home isolation with health advice \nMild illness in a patient who can be managed safely in the community AND who \nis not in a higher risk group for complications.  \nClinical pathway: Self isolate at home; health advice on how to identify \ndeterioration; call CMS if more unwell. \n \nOxygen \nThe use of oxygen in pneumonia is based on expert opinion. A Cochrane  \nsystematic review of the effectiveness of oxygen in adults with pneumonia \nhighlights that the evidence is weak and limited owing to a small number of \n\n\n\nOxford COVID-19 Evidence Service  \n\n 6 \n\nstudies. The British Thoracic Society suggests that for patients with pneumonia \nnot at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure, it is appropriate to aim for an \noxygen saturation of 94–98%. Very elderly patients may tolerate an abnormally \nlow SaO2 at rest when clinically stable; however, COVID-19 pneumonia may \nsignificantly worsen SaO2. Access to oxygen therapy will be challenging at the \nheight of a pandemic.  \n  \nCorticosteroids \nIn the initial phase of pneumonia, elderly patients can present with wheezing \nand respiratory distress. It is not uncommon to consider corticosteroids at this \nstage, because of their anti-inflammatory effects.  Corticosteroids were widely \nused during the 2002-3 SARS outbreak. However, in a subsequent systematic \nreview, including 29 low quality studies of steroid use, 25 studies were \ninconclusive and four reported possible harm from steroid use.  A further \nevidence review did not support corticosteroid treatment, reporting no evidence \nof net benefit with corticosteroids in “respiratory infection due to RSV, influenza, \nSARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV”, and that corticosteroids probably impair clearance \nof SARS-CoV.  In contrast to pneumonia, corticosteroids show much clearer \nbenefit in patients with sepsis. \n \nPotential harms of rapid deployment of antibiotics for pneumonia \nThe main disadvantage of this proposed strategy is that it would tend to drive \nincreased bacterial resistance. However, in a pandemic with a high mortality \nrate in a specific subpopulation, in this case very elderly people, this needs to \nbe weighed against the benefits of the policy.  Apart from penicillin allergy, \nadverse reactions to the recommended antibiotics, e.g. macrolides, are \ngenerally mild and uncommon.  \n \nConclusions \nInterventions that affect mortality in pneumonia are of great significance for \npublic health, particularly during the current pandemic. Rescue prescribing \nstrategies, initiated by the patient at an early stage, could aid effective delivery \nof antimicrobials, significantly reduce hospital admissions, and reduce mortality. \nWhile reducing antimicrobial resistance should remain a global priority, the \ncurrent pandemic highlights the need for unprecedented management \nstrategies. For example, in the current context, it may be entirely appropriate for \nnursing homes to have routine stockpiles of antibiotics, allowing rapid and \nappropriate prescribing decisions that could minimize morbidity and mortality, \nas well as reducing the impact of the pandemic on health services. Rapid \ninterventions like this could be life-saving.  \n \nA UK strategy of prospectively self isolating those over 70 is being considered. \nIn this context, equipping patients with rescue antibiotics may be a legitimate \nstrategy to consider. Stragies should also plan to ensure that all those eligible at \n\n\n\nOxford COVID-19 Evidence Service  \n\n 7 \n\nrisk, eg COPD and immuno-compromised as well as the elderly, were up to \ndate with preventive immunisation (influenza and pneumococcal); and also \nconsider rescue medication provision for younger people over 50 at-risk through \nsignificant co-morbidities (defined). \n \nIn patients with few physiological reserves, there is no room for error, and \nproviding the right initial treatment, and rapidly, matters. \n \nDisclaimer:  the article has not been peer-reviewed; it should not replace \nindividual clinical judgement and the sources cited should be checked.

Comorbidities, impaired immunity and frailty, \n\nincluding a reduced ability to cough and to clear secretions from the lungs, can all \n\ncontribute to this complication. Older people are therefore more likely to develop severe \n\npneumonia, suffer from respiratory failure, and die.  \n\n \n\nViruses are thought to cause about 50% of cases of pneumonia. Viral pneumonia is \n\ngenerally less severe than bacterial pneumonia but can act as a precursor to it. \n\nPreventing any pneumonia in older adults is preferable to treating it. \n\n \n\nIdentification of the early stages of pneumonia in older patients can prove difficult. \n\nTraditional symptoms and signs, including fever, may be absent. Limited evidence \n\nsuggests that many tests that are useful in younger patients do not help diagnose \n\ninfections in older adults.  The onset of pneumonia in elderly people can often be rapid, \n\nand the prognosis is poor in severe pneumonia: as many as one in five will die.   The \n\nolder you are, the more prevalent severe pneumonia becomes.    \n\n \n\nPatients in nursing homes appear to fare even worse, as they often have several \n\ncomorbidities and poor nutritional status and are often physically inactive. [5] In-\n\nhospital mortality is significantly higher, even after adjusting for age and sex.  \n\n \n\nCommon causative organisms in older adults admitted to hospital with pneumonia \n\ninclude Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Less commonly, \n\nHaemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus may be responsible. In severe \n\npneumonia, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are \n\ncommon causative organisms. In community-acquired pneumonia, the causative agent \n\nis often not known. \n\n \n\nOlder patients may have polymicrobial infections, which could be a factor in those who \n\ndo not respond to initial antimicrobial treatment.  Sputum cultures are often not reliable, \n\nas the microbial aetiology of severe pneumonia based on invasive diagnostic techniques \n\noften differs from the organisms found in the sputum. \n\n \n\nmailto:carl.heneghan@phc.ox.ac.uk\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html\nhttps://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-gb/3000168/complications\nhttps://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1205-0\nhttps://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1205-0\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17278083\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15614461\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20060700\nhttps://paperpile.com/c/AI2QDT/K6Aj\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28694251\nhttps://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-13-94\nhttps://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-13-94\nhttps://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-13-94\nhttps://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-13-94\n\n\nOxford COVID-19 Evidence Service  \n\n 2 \n\nAssessment of 12,945 US Medicare in-patients with pneumonia, aged over 65, showed \n\nthat initial treatment with a second-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide, or a non-\n\nantipseudomonal third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide, or a fluoroquinolone \n\nalone lowered 30-day mortality.  And an analysis of 101 patients aged > 75 (mean and \n\nSD, 82 ± 5.5) admitted to an intensive care unit reported significantly higher mortality \n\nin those who received inadequate antimicrobial therapy (39% versus 4%; P = 0.007). \n\n \n\nViral infections increase pneumococcal adherence to the local epithelium, facilitating \n\nbacterial infection. Adhesion of Streptococcus pneumoniae to epithelial cells, for \n\nexample, is significantly enhanced by human coronavirus HCoV-NL63 infection.  \n\nCoronavirus causes inflammatory damage in the lungs, preventing clearance of bacteria. \n\nSecondary bacterial infection worsens prognosis. Most deaths in the influenza \n\npandemics of 1918, 1957, and 1968 were caused by secondary bacterial infections.  \n\nConcurrent bacterial pneumonia was highlighted as a particular problem in elderly \n\npeople in the 2003 SARS outbreak.   \n\n \n\nEarly use of antibiotics in older adults \n\nNon-response to initial antimicrobial therapy increases mortality, and so the initial \n\nselection of antimicrobials is critical. According to NICE, to cover atypical and multiple \n\npathogens in older patients with pneumonia and at risk of severe complications, the \n\nrecommended choices of antibiotics in the community are:    \n\n \n\nAmoxicillin with  500 mg 3 times a day (higher doses can be used – see BNF) for 5 days \n\nClarithromycin  500 mg twice a day for 5 days \n\n \n\nAlternative oral antibiotics for penicillin allergy, if the pneumonia is of moderate-intensity; treatment \n\nshould be guided by microbiological results when available  \n\nDoxycycline \n\nwith  \n\n200 mg on the first day, then 100 mg once a day for a further 4 days (5‑day \n\ncourse in total) \n\nClarithromycin 500 mg twice a day for 5 days \n\n \n\nThe intensity of pneumonia in the community can be assessed using the  CRB65 score; \n\neach factor scores one point:  \n\n● confusion (abbreviated Mental Test score 8 or less, or new disorientation in \n\nperson, place, or time); \n\n● a raised respiratory rate (30 breaths per minute or more); \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10573046\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10573046\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168281/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168281/\nhttps://www.archbronconeumol.org/en-review-non-bacterial-infections-in-respiratory-articulo-S1579212915003067\nhttps://www.archbronconeumol.org/en-review-non-bacterial-infections-in-respiratory-articulo-S1579212915003067\nhttps://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/WHO_CDS_CSR_ARO_2004_1.pdf\nhttps://cks.nice.org.uk/chest-infections-adult#!scenarioRecommendation:3\nhttps://thorax.bmj.com/content/58/5/377\nhttps://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg191/chapter/1-recommendations#ftn.footnote_2\n\n\nOxford COVID-19 Evidence Service  \n\n 3 \n\n● a low blood pressure (diastolic 60 mmHg or less, or systolic less than 90 \n\nmmHg); \n\n● age 65 years or over. \n\nScore 1 or 2: intermediate risk (1‑10% mortality risk). \n\nScore 3 or 4: high risk (more than 10% mortality risk). \n\n \n\nNICE recommends that anyone with a score of 2 should be admitted to hospital. NICE’s \n\napproach, however, doesn’t account for the high risk in very elderly people. The \n\nmortality rate from COVID-19 approaches 15% at age 80 (Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nSource data: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/ (accessed 13 March \n\n2020) \n\n \n\nCurrent NICE guidance requires starting antibiotic treatment as soon as possible after \n\nestablishing a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia, and certainly within 4 \n\nhours. This strategy is supported by the results of a US multicenter retrospective cohort \n\nstudy, a medical record review of 14,069 patients aged over 65 years and hospitalized \n\nwith pneumonia. A  lower 30-day mortality was associated with antibiotic \n\nadministration within 8 hours of hospital arrival (odds ratio = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.75-\n\n0.96).   \n\n \n\nHowever, this may not be possible within the constraints of an overstretched service in a \n\npandemic.

Strategies should also plan to ensure that all those eligible at risk, eg COPD \n\nand immuno-compromised as well as the elderly, were up to date with preventive \n\nimmunisation (influenza and pneumococcal). And also consider rescue medication for \n\nthose aged 70 or older (regardless of medical conditions), and under 70 with an \n\nunderlying health condition instructed to get a flu jab as an adult each year on medical \n\ngrounds. \n\n \n\nIn patients with few physiological reserves, there is no room for error, and providing the \n\nright initial treatment, and rapidly, matters. \n\n \n\nDisclaimer:  the article has not been peer-reviewed; it should not replace individual \n\nclinical judgement, and the sources cited should be checked.

It increases the risk of becoming infected with acute respiratory infections, as well as the risk of those infections becoming severe. As well as affecting the respiratory system, smoking can also cause or exacerbate co-morbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Evidence from China shows that comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory conditions, and diabetes all increase risk of serious complications and death from COVID-19.\n\nAs well as increasing risks of acute respiratory infections in people who smoke, second-hand smoke also increases risks of acute respiratory infections in young people.\n\n\nIf you quit smoking during an acute respiratory infection is your outcome better?\n\nVerdict Yes: Evidence shows that quitting smoking during an acute respiratory infection reduces the risk of developing serious complications such as bronchitis and pneumonia. Even if someone has smoked for decades, quitting smoking can lead to almost immediate improvements in the cardiovascular and respiratory system. Within one to two days of quitting smoking, positive effects can be observed in blood pressure, heart rate, vasoconstriction, and oxygen levels.\n\n\nWill quitting smoking now help reduce risks?\n\nVerdict Yes: According to the WHO, tobacco users are less likely to become infected with COVID-19\xa0 if they quit smoking as it will reduce hand-to-mouth transmission. In addition, as well as the near-immediate improvements to the cardiovascular and respiratory systems outlined above, comorbidities such as cardiovascular conditions, lung conditions, and diabetes can improve very soon after quitting smoking. As there is evidence that comorbid conditions increase the risks of COVID-19, this may improve people’s responses to the infection and reduce their chances of transmitting it to others.\n\n\nAre there ways to increase the success of smoking cessation attempts in the current circumstances?\n\nVerdict Yes: Even though options for face-to-face support and prescription medications may be limited in the current COVID-19 outbreak, there is abundant evidence for the effectiveness of other forms of smoking cessation support. Nicotine replacement therapy \xa0(in the form of patches, gum, lozenges, and sprays) increases the chances of long-term smoking cessation by approximately 50% and is considered safe to use, even during lapses to smoking. Nicotine replacement therapies are widely available in supermarkets and pharmacies. Evidence from randomized controlled trials shows that using two forms of nicotine replacement therapy at the same time (a patch plus a faster-acting form like gum or lozenge) increases the chances of quitting compared to a single form and is as effective as prescription stop-smoking medications.\n\nAccessing behavioural support on its own or in addition to pharmacotherapy also increases long-term quit rates. There is good quality evidence that telephone counselling (as provided by national quitlines, for example), increases quit rates. There is also evidence that internet, text-message, and print-based interventions increase quit rates. The resources tested are those available through trusted sources, such as governments and health care providers (for example, the NHS in Britain or the CDC in the USA).\n\nIt may feel particularly stressful to try to quit smoking in the current circumstances, but there is evidence that quitting smoking leads to improvements in mental health. Dentists and pharmacists are also able to provide effective advice. If quitting completely feels unachievable currently, there is evidence that cutting down to quit \xa0(gradually reducing cigarette consumption) is as effective for long-term smoking cessation as stopping abruptly. However, there is no evidence to suggest that reducing without quitting is beneficial. Therefore, under the current circumstances it may be sensible to try and reduce to quit over a short period. It is safe to use nicotine replacement therapy during this period and evidence suggests that using a fast-acting form (e.g. gum or lozenges) to replace cigarettes whilst reducing can increase the chances of success.\n\n\nDisclaimer:\xa0 the article has not been peer-reviewed; it should not replace individual clinical judgement and the sources cited should be checked.

The rapid and widespread purchase of antipyretic medication over-the-counter has led to temporary shortages.\xa0\n\n\nWhat is a fever?\xa0\n\nA common symptom of Covid, influenza and sometimes other viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) is fever. Reports of the pattern of Covid symptoms suggest that fever is most common an average\xa0 5 days after exposure. The range of ‘normal’ temperatures depends on the site\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\nSite of\xa0 measurement\n\n\tNormal low\tNormal high\tSingle measure fever\tMultiple measures fever\n\tAxilla\t35.5\t37.0\t>37.5\t–\n\tOral\t35.6\t37.7\t>37.8\t>37.2\n\tRectal\t34.4\t37.8\t>38.0\t>37.5\n\tTympanic\t35.4\t37.8\t>38.0\t–\n\tAny\t–\t–\t–\t>1.1 over baseline\n\n\n\xa0\n\nA review of ‘normal body temperature in adults’ including studies from 1935-1999 concluded the range of normal oral temperature was 35.6 c\xa0 to 38.2 c.\xa0 The American College of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Disease Society define fever as core body temperature greater or equal to 38.3 c. NICE \xa0consider an infant or child has a fever\xa0if their temperature is 38°C or higher.\n\nA systematic review of normal body temperature found that older adults (age ≥60) had a lower temperature than younger adults (age <60) by 0.23°C, on average.\n\nWhat are the benefits of a fever?\n\nFever is a complex, physiological and adaptive response to infection. Fever is a symptom, rather than a diagnosis. It is important to establish the cause of fever in relation to the patient’s clinical condition and symptom pattern – remember, some patients may have both Covid-19 and other illness.\xa0\n\n\tFever is common and is a good prognostic sign in acutely unwell patients with infection, associated with higher rates of survival.\n\tIn a prospective observational study (n= 502) fever inhibited microbial reproduction and viral replication, as well as accelerated the rate of phagocytosis.\n\tHeat-shock proteins (present in fever) are also thought to prevent thermal damage to cells by inhibiting pro-inflammatory-signalling pathways.\n\tAn individual’s ability to mount a febrile response has been shown to be a good prognostic sign in critically unwell patients (Lee 2012, Young 2012),\xa0\n\n\nWhat are the indications for taking an antipyretic in Covid-19?\n\nFirst, ask ‘what symptom am I aiming to treat’? For most adults, there is no convincing evidence that fever is itself detrimental and does not automatically require suppression.\n\nChildren: A systematic review on the prolongation of febrile illness with the use of antipyretics in children who have acute infections suggested antipyretics do not slow recovery from infectious diseases.\xa0 Six papers were included in the review. Three focused on children with malaria and\xa0 3 considered general viral and respiratory infections and varicella. The mean difference in time to fever clearance was 4 hours and was faster in those receiving antipyretics compared with those not (95% CI -6.35 to -1.96 hours; P = .0002).\n\nHowever, based on extrapolations from studies of the use of paracetamol following vaccination, showing reduced antibody response to some antigens (Prymula 2009), they advocate avoidance of antipyretic use early in infections. Although childhood fevers can be lowered by antipyretics (Wong 2014), several randomised clinical trials have shown no evidence that antipyretic administration reduces the incidence of seizures in susceptible children (Offringa and Newton 2013).\xa0\n\nPregnancy: is not specifically covered in this document. See here\xa0\n\nElderly, or patients with comorbidities: this group are thought to be the most susceptible to Covid-19 complications. The Elderly can have blunted febrile responses during severe infection (Hammond and Boyle 2011), which may indicate a less robust immune response. This group may also be more vulnerable to increased physiological demands during fever (Carey 2010, Launey 2011). Antipyretic medication in critically unwell patients with a limited cardiopulmonary reserve may reduce the risk of haemodynamic instability and hypoxic tissue damage (Kiekkas 2013).\xa0\n\nMedications for fever\xa0\n\nParacetamol\n\nMost paracetamol studies report lower body temperature, however, reductions are modest. \n\nNICE BNF Cautions\n\n\n\nBefore administering, check when paracetamol last administered and cumulative paracetamol dose over previous 24 hours;\xa0body-weight under 50 kg;\xa0chronic alcohol consumption;\xa0chronic dehydration;\xa0chronic malnutrition;\xa0hepatocellular insufficiency;\xa0long-term use (especially in those who are malnourished)\n\nSome patients may be at increased risk of experiencing toxicity at therapeutic doses, particularly those with a body-weight under 50 kg and those with risk factors for hepatotoxicity. Clinical judgement should be used to adjust the dose of oral and intravenous paracetamol in these patients. Co‐administration of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic medications may increase toxicity; doses should be reduced.\n\n\n\n\nFor specific details on the management of poisoning, see Paracetamol, under\xa0Emergency treatment of poisoning.\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\nNSAIDs\n\nIbuprofen has been shown to reduce fever, tachycardia and oxygen consumption, but not prevent shock or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and it does not improve survival.\n\nA randomized controlled trial (RCT) of intravenous ibuprofen in 455 patients who had sepsis (defined as fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and acute failure of at least one organ system. There were reductions in temperature, heart rate, oxygen consumption, and lactic acidosis. Survival at 30 days (37% with ibuprofen compared with 40%\xa0 placebo.\n\nIn an RCT\xa0 of ibuprofen, paracetamol and steam with patients with ARIs in primary care showed that while children and patients with chest infections experienced some symptomatic relief with ibuprofen alone, most patients gained no benefit from advice to use ibuprofen alone; 889 patients were randomised to advice on analgesia (take paracetamol, ibuprofen, or both), dosing of analgesia (take as required v regularly), and steam inhalation (no inhalation v steam inhalation). Main results are:\n\n\tAdvice on dosing or on steam inhalation did not affect outcomes.\n\tCompared with paracetamol, symptoms were not significantly different from ibuprofen or the combination of ibuprofen and paracetamol (0.11, -0.04 to 0.26).\n\tThere was no evidence of benefit with ibuprofen among most subgroups\xa0 (presence of otalgia; previous duration of symptoms; temperature >37.5 °C; severe symptoms),\n\tIn the subgroup with chest infections, the equivalent of one in two symptoms was rated as slightly rather than a moderately bad problem.\n\tReconsultations with new/unresolved symptoms or complications were slightly higher in those taking ibuprofen 20% vs 12% with paracetamol (adjusted risk ratio 1.67, 1.12 to 2.38),\n\tMild thermal injury with steam was documented for four patients (2%)\n\n\nIn combination with paracetamol; or use of a regular regime.

Inhaled corticosteroids are generally considered a safe and frontline treatment for controlling asthma symptoms. Evidence from a 2013 systematic review of seven randomized controlled trials found that discontinuing inhaled corticosteroids in people with stable asthma more than doubled the risk of asthma exacerbation (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.88 to 2.92, mean follow-up 27 weeks). Inhaled corticosteroids, when taken as prescribed, would reduce the risk of an asthma attack being triggered by a respiratory virus such as COVID-19. There is uncertainty over whether the prescription of higher dose increases the risks of pneumonia.\n\nThere is evidence that inhaled steroids increase the risks of (some) respiratory infections in people with asthma\n\nA 2019 systematic review of 17 randomized controlled trials in people with asthma ( n = 15,336) found that Inhaled corticosteroid treatment (ICS) was associated with a significantly increased risk of upper respiratory tract infections (Odds ratio R 1.24, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.42). There was minimal statistical heterogeneity despite the fact the studies included a range of doses and treatments and used a range of different definitions of upper respiratory tract infection. When subgroup analyses were performed for high- and low- dose ICS, both were associated with a statistically significant increase in upper respiratory tract infections. Subgroups by treatment type were limited by imprecision. Observational studies suggest the possible presence of a dose-response relationship for pneumonia risk.\xa0 However, in these studies, it is difficult to rule out confounding, as more severe asthma symptoms may lead to the prescription of higher doses and, therefore, may independently increase risks from respiratory infections. The finding of increased infection risk in people using ICS is consistent with the evidence in trials of inhaled steroids used for other conditions.\n\nThere is less developed evidence that inhaled steroids may also protect against some respiratory infections\n\nA laboratory study found formoterol and budesonide may inhibit rhinovirus infection. Another recent laboratory study found that glycopyrronium, formoterol, and a combination of glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide inhibit replication of one type of coronavirus (HCoV-229E).\xa0\n\nLimitations\n\nThe evidence-base from randomized controlled trials is comparatively small and pooled estimates have wide confidence intervals. It may be that inhaled corticosteroids have different effects on different kinds of respiratory infections. We are yet to have any data on inhaled corticosteroids as they relate to COVID-19. As asthma is in itself associated with an increased risk of serious respiratory infections, observational studies analysing associations between inhaled steroids for asthma and respiratory infection may be subject to confounding.\n\nDisclaimer:\xa0 the article has not been peer-reviewed; it should not replace individual clinical judgement and the sources cited should be checked.

If there is no alternative, consider the actual temperature measurement will be at out by at least +/-1.5°C and ask for repeated measurements.\n\nYoung Children\n\nIn young children the advice is straightforward and is found in NICE’s recent guideline on in the under 5s where they state:\n\n“1.1.5 Forehead chemical thermometers are unreliable and should not be used by healthcare professionals.”\n\nChildren\n\nFor children generally (as opposed to just the under 5s) the evidence appears variable! The earliest paper we found was “An Evaluation of a Plastic Strip Thermometer” which reports “We conclude that the Clinitemp is unacceptable as a substitute for the mercury/glass thermometer.” In the same year, a smaller study (n=134) reported: “Parents who rely on these strips to identify a fever in their children may be misled by an erroneous afebrile reading.”\n\nA 1996 study with 120 patients (20 in each of six age groups: < 1 month, 1 to 5 months, 6 to 11 months, 12 to 23 months, 2 to 14 years, and adults concluded: that previous studies have all used inappropriate methods of analysis….. Forehead strip thermometers are easy to use, but they do not estimate the rectal Temperature as accurately as the axillary Temperature does.”\n\nA more recent cross-sectional \xa02018 study of 995 children found that temporal measurement of temperature is not recommendable, but the ear measurement proved useful for screening purposes, especially among children aged six months to 5 years.\n\nChildren and Adults\n\nThree reviews were found with the earliest being the 2010 RACGP review which concluded:\n\n“The digital thermometer provides the best agreement with the mercury in glass thermometer. The infrared tympanic thermometer may be a preferable option for the uncooperative patient. The liquid crystal forehead thermometer is best used at home.”\n\nIn 2012, Healthcare Improvement Scotland produced a technology scoping report that found:\n\n\tEvidence from a range of adult and paediatric patient groups suggests that temporal artery thermometers are insufficiently accurate for clinical use in inpatient settings\n\n\nSix studies compared both temporal artery thermometers (TAT) and infrared in-ear thermometers four studies favoured TAT.\n\ninfrared in-ear thermometers\n\nA 2015 \xa0systematic review of \xa075 studies (n = 8682) on the accuracy of Peripheral Thermometers for Estimating Temperature reported that most studies at high or unclear risk of bias. The main results were:\n\n\tPeripheral thermometers had pooled 95% limits of agreement outside the predefined clinically acceptable range (± 0.5 °C),\n\tEspecially among patients with fever (-1.44 °C to 1.46 °C for adults; -1.49 °C to 0.43 °C for children)\n\tFor detection of fever, sensitivity was low 64% but specificity was high (96% [CI, 93% to 97%]; I2 = 96.3%; P < 0.001).\n\n\nLimitations:\xa0High-quality data for some temperature measurement techniques are limited. Pooled data are associated with interstudy heterogeneity that is not fully explained by stratified and metaregression analyses. Their performance may be improved by taking repeated measurements over time, and they can be useful for measuring Temperature in children while they are sleeping.\n\nAdults\n\nWe found a single study in 201 only adults in ICU that reported the compact digital axillar thermometer and the digital thermometer with probe obtained the highest overall valuation score.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\xa0 the article has not been peer-reviewed; it should not replace individual clinical judgement and the sources cited should be checked.

The latest figures (17 March 2020) suggest that about 180,00 people have been infected worldwide, with about 7200 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) designated COVID-19 a “public health emergency of international concern” on 30 January and declared it a pandemic on 11 March.\n\nCOVID-19 should have come as no surprise. Gralinski and Baric, in a review in 2015 wrote: “The existence of novel bat SARS-like coronaviruses that also use bat, civet and human angiotensin 1 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors for entry, such as SARS-CoV [now SARS-CoV-1], strongly suggests an opportunity for further zoonotic disease outbreaks in human and animal populations.” Yet attempts to develop effective treatments against two other coronavirus diseases, SARS and MERS, have so far failed.\n\nThe coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that encode for four enzymes essential to the viral life cycle. They enter mammalian cells through an interaction of a viral spike glycoprotein and a receptor—ACE2 for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and dipetidylpeptidase 4 for MERS.\n\nWhile the outbreak of COVID-19 was intensifying and spreading globally, 382 trials were registered between 23 January and 8 March (379 registered in China) on the WHO’s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), some of which might affect morbidity and mortality and help us understand the disease.\n\nWe downloaded the listings of these 382 registered trials and classified them to aid interpretation of the type of interventions being proposed. The numbers of new trials that have been added to the list since the middle of\xa0 January are shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The numbers of new trials added to the WHO’s website week by week (blue), with the cumulative numbers (orange)\n\nWe categorized the 382 registered trials as follows (Figure 2):\n\n\tPharmacological interventions, n = 108; see Table 1.\n\tTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), n = 98 (includes 48 named TCMs; 27 unspecified methods; 18 combinations with unspecified Western therapies; and 5 others, e.g. acupuncture).\n\tClinical presentation, n = 81 (includes 63 studies of epidemiology, susceptibility factors, and clinical outcomes; 21 studies of diagnostic methods, both clinical and laboratory; and 19studies of prognostic features).\n\tAdvanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP), n = 38, are medicinal products that include cellular therapies, tissue extracts, plasma, and vaccines for treatment not prevention. See the box at the end of the article for the 24 different interventions under investigation, the most common being mesenchymal stem cells and infusion of plasma from patients who have recovered (5 registered trials each).\n\tOthers, n = 33 (includes nutritional supplements and enteral feeds; physiotherapy and exercise; physical therapies, such as renal replacement therapy; and psychotherapies).\n\tTwo registered trials have been cancelled.\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\nProposed pharmacological interventions\n\nSeveral agents may act directly against coronaviruses. Others, particularly monoclonal antibodies,\xa0 may limit the cytokine dysregulation that causes fatal respiratory disease. Others may provide symptomatic relief.\n\nIn Table 1 we have listed the proposed pharmacological interventions and their mechanisms, when known, classified under 10 main headings (plus one heading to deal with combination studies):\n\n\tAntiviral drugs, not specified\n\tAntiviral drugs, broad spectrum\n\tAntiviral drugs, antiretrovirals\n\tOther antiviral drugs\n\tAntimalarial drugs\n\tAntibiotics and antiparasitics\n\tNonspecific anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs\n\tKinase inhibitors\n\tMonoclonal antibodies\n\tMiscellaneous others\n\n\nAntiviral drugs that affect other RNA viruses (which include Ebola virus, rabies, influenza, hepatitis C, West Nile fever, polio, and measles), some of which have also been shown to have in vitro activity against 2019-nCoV, might be effective in COVID-19. However, in vitro activity of this sort does not guarantee clinical efficacy. Indeed, a note of caution is required. In experimental animals ribavirin, for example, enhanced the infectivity of SARS-CoV-1. Furthermore, in a systematic review of 30 trials of ribavirin in patients with SARS, 26 were classified as inconclusive and four showed possible harm. There is no guarantee that antiviral drugs will be beneficial in COVID-19, and adverse reactions are likely.\n\nAntiviral drugs that are effective against DNA viruses, such as HIV, would not be expected to be as efficacious. Although some have been shown to be effective in vitro against 2019-nCoV, that is no guarantee of in vivo efficacy.\n\nChloroquine has been shown to be effective, both in vitro and clinically, against the coronavirus that caused SARS in 2003-4, SARS-CoV-1. Again, this does not predict clinical efficacy in COVID-19.\n\nCorticosteroids may be harmful. In a systematic review of 29 low-quality studies of steroid use, 25 were inconclusive and in four there was evidence of harm.\xa0 A further evidence review did not support corticosteroid treatment, reporting no evidence of net benefit with corticosteroids in “respiratory infection due to RSV, influenza, SARS-CoV [SARS-CoV-1], or MERS-CoV”, and showing that corticosteroids probably impair clearance of SARS-CoV-1.\n\nAs far as the miscellaneous group of other medicines is concerned, there are mechanistic arguments in favour of some of them and not others. For example, there is no good evidence that vitamin C is efficacious in treating any condition other than vitamin C deficiency; furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of vitamin C are such that the administration of even very high oral doses does not increase the body load, as reflected by plasma concentrations, by more than twofold and can cause diarrhoea and renal stones, since its absorption from the gut is saturable and it has high renal clearance.\n\nTable 1.

Pre-existing medications and conditions need to be taken account of when deciding to prescribe NSAIDs for symptomatic ARI. The lowest effective dose should be prescribed for the shortest period of time. Parenteral use of NSAIDs during an ARI should be avoided.\n\nNSAIDs do not significantly reduce total symptoms or duration of respiratory infections.\n\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used by patients with ARI or common cold for pain and fever relief. Their use needs to be balanced with the risks and benefits. Current research evidence in coronavirus is lacking and therefore evidence from acute respiratory infections have been used to inform this review.\n\nDo NSAIDs increase rates of heart attacks in ARI?\n\nInfluenza-like illness and respiratory tract infection are associated with an increase in acute myocardial infarction.\xa0 A meta-analysis of 16 case-control studies reported that influenza-like illness was twice as likely in those with an acute heart attack, OR 2.01 (95% CI 1.47 to 2.76).\n\nLong-term use of NSAIDs has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of a heart attack.\xa0 Individual data from four studies of\xa0 446,763 individuals including 61,460 with acute myocardial infarction showed that taking any dose of NSAIDs for one week or more was associated with a 50% increased risk of a heart attack. Odds ratios for increased: Ibuprofen, 1.48 (1.00 to 2.26); Diclofenac, 1.50 (1.06 to 2.04) and Naproxen\xa0 1.53 (1.07 to 2.33).\n\nUse of NSAIDs during acute respiratory infections has been associated with an increased risk of a heart attack:\n\nA retrospective analysis of 9,793 patients with incident acute myocardial infarction in Taiwan between 2007 and 2011 found that the use of NSAIDs during acute respiratory infection was associated with:\n\n\tIncreased risk of a heart attack; adjusted odds ratio * 3.41; 95% CI 2.80–4.16);\n\tWithout NSAIDs led to a 2.7-fold increased risk (aOR = 2.65; 95% CI = 2.29 to 3.06):\n\tParenteral NSAIDs (any non-oral means of administration) was associated with much higher risk (OR = 7.22; 95% CI = 4.07 to 12.81).\n\n\nUse of NSAIDs during acute respiratory infections has been associated with an increased risk of stroke:\n\nAn analysis of 29 518 patients with an incident stroke suggested that NSAIDs were associated with a more than doubling of the risk of stroke,\xa0 adjusted odds ratio,* aOR 2.27, 95% CI, 2.00-2.58). Parenteral NSAIDs were associated with a much higher risk of ischemic stroke (aOR 4.24, 95% CI, 2.92‐6.15) or a hemorrhagic stroke (aOR 9.71, 95% CI, 3.79‐24.92).\n\n*Adjusted for discordant use of concomitant medications before the index date\n\nNICE BNF advice\xa0\n\n‘All NSAID use (including cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitors) can, to varying degrees, be associated with a small increased risk of thrombotic events (e.g. myocardial infarction and stroke) independent of baseline cardiovascular risk factors or duration of NSAID use; however, the greatest risk may be in those receiving high doses long term.’\n\n‘The lowest effective dose of NSAID should be prescribed for the shortest period of time to control symptoms and the need for long-term treatment should be reviewed periodically.’\n\nDo NSAIDs affect the duration of the infection?\n\nA Cochrane Systematic review including 9 trials (n=1,069) of NSAIDs for the common cold found they did not significantly reduce the total symptom score (SMD ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐1.03 to 0.24) or duration of colds. The effect on pain relief\xa0 (headache, ear pain, and muscle and joint pain) was significant.\n\nFive studies assessed adverse effects. The pooled analysis for overall side effects suggested they were three-time more likely\xa0 (risk ratio (RR) 2.94, 95% CI 0.51 to 17.03), but this effect was not significant. Adverse effects included gastrointestinal adverse effects and lethargy/drowsiness, feeling hyperactive, feeling more awake, flushed face, difficulty sleeping, light‐headedness and dry mouth\n\nDoes the use of NSAIDs worsen outcomes in respiratory infections?\n\nWe found five studies that link the use of NSAIDs to worsening outcome, all are observational and are difficult to interpret as they may suffer from confounding by indication. patients with more severe disease and more severe symptoms may take more NSAIDs which does not necessarily cause the disease. All five studies suggest that NSAIDs worsen outcomes, which reinforces the need to take the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time.\n\n\tA small prospective observational study (n=57) reported that NSAIDs for >6 days and the presence of immunosuppression prior to admission were associated with prolonged hospitalization. Patients that received NSAIDs prior to hospitalization used them for a mean of 4.4 days prior to admission.\n\tIn a cohort of 90\xa0 consecutive patients with Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) admitted to one ICU over a four year period, 32 (36%) had taken NSAIDs prior to hospital referral. Patients taking NSADS were younger,\xa0 had fewer comorbidities and a longer duration of symptoms before referral. They more often pleural empyema and lung cavitation complications (37.5% vs 7%; P = .0009), and had higher rates of bacteraemia (69% vs 27%, P = .009).\n\tIn a study of 221 patients with CAP 40 (18%) developed a pleuropulmonary complication. NSAIDs intake prior to admission was reported in 24 patients (11%) who were younger (51 vs. 67yrs), had fewer comorbidities (60 vs. 25%), and had a longer time between the first symptoms of CAP and the start of antibiotic therapy (6.1 vs. 2.8\xa0 days; p = 0.001). They also had higher rates of pleuropulmonary complications (33 vs. 16%; p = 0.048).\n\tNSAIDs may also mask initial symptoms and delay antimicrobial therapy. A review of medical records of 106 confirmed patients with pneumococcal CAP found 20 received NSAIDs 2 to 6 days before admission. NSAIDs exposed patients were younger (43 vs 62 years), had increased complicated pleural effusions rages\xa0 (20% vs 2.3%; P = .01), and required more noninvasive ventilatory support (25% vs 4.6%; P = .003).\n\tA \xa0multicentre case-control study in 8 ICUs of 152 adult patients admitted for severe sepsis or septic shock due to bacterial community-acquired infection found that in patients using NSAIDs (27%) The average median time to the prescription of effective antibiotic therapy was longer for NSAID users (6 days, 95% CI = 3 to 7 days) than for nonusers (3 days, 95% CI = 2 to 3 days; P = 0.02).\xa0\xa0\n\n\nDo NSAIDs Impact on overall mortality in ARI?

Estimates from the cruise ship ‘Diamond Princess’ as well as countries with three or fewer deaths to date recorded were excluded from the analysis. Country-level case fatality is presented as a percentage along with 95% confidence intervals in a forest plot. Estimates of heterogeneity and a 95% prediction interval are presented, but a pooled overall estimate is suppressed due to heterogeneity.\n\n*case fatality rate is the number of reported deaths per number of reported cases\n\n\n\nBetween countries, case Fatality rates vary significantly, which suggests considerable uncertainty over the exact case fatality rates.\n\nWhat might be affecting the case fatality rate?\n\n\tThe number of cases detected by testing might vary considerably by country;\n\tSelection bias can mean those with severe disease are preferentially tested;\n\tThere may be delays between symptoms onset and deaths \xa0which\xa0 can lead to underestimation of the CFR;\n\tThere may be factors that account for increased death rates such\xa0 as coinfection,\xa0 poorer healthcare, patient demographics (i.e., older patients might be more prevalent in countries such as Italy);\n\tThere may be increased rates of smoking or comorbidities amongst the fatalities.\n\n\nCoronavirus: Is Covid-19 really the cause of all the fatalities in Italy?\n\nIn China,\xa0 CFR was higher in the early stages of the outbreak (17% for cases from 1to 10 January) and reduced to 0.7% for patients with symptom onset after 1 February.\n\nIn Italy, there are several reasons why CFR might be higher: the age structure of the Italian population (2nd oldest population in the world); highest rates of antibiotic resistance deaths in Europe which might contribute to increased pneumonia deaths (Italy tops the EU\xa0 for antibiotic-resistance deaths with nearly 1/3rd\xa0 of the deaths in the EU). Smoking also seems to be a factor associated with poor survival –\xa0 in Italy, 24% smoke, 28% men. In the UK, for instance, 15% are current smokers.\n\nUpdate 20 March: Coronavirus: Is Covid-19 really the cause of all the fatalities in Italy?\n\nSarah Newy reports that Italy’s death rate might be higher because of how fatalities are recorded.\xa0 In Italy, all those who die in hospitals with coronavirus will be included in the death numbers.\xa0\xa0However in the article, Professor Walter Ricciardi,\xa0 scientific adviser to, Italy’s minister of health, reports,\xa0 “On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus, while 88 per cent of patients who have died have at least one pre-morbidity – many had two or three.”\n\nRecording the numbers of those who die with coronavirus will inflate the CFR as opposed to those that died from Coronavirus, which will reduce the CFR.\n\nComparison with Swine Flu\n\nThe overall case fatality rate as of 16 July 2009 \xa0(10 weeks after the first international alert) with pandemic H1N1 influenza varied from 0.1% to 5.1% depending on the country.\xa0 \xa0The WHO reported in 2019 that swine flu ended up with a fatality rate of 0.02%.\n\nEvaluating CFR during a pandemic is a hazardous exercise, and high-end estimates end be treated with caution as the H1N1 pandemic highlights that original estimates were out by a factor greater than 10.\n\nEffect of concurrent infections\n\nHighest peak rate ratios for admissions are in those years where confirmed concurrent circulation of Influenza LIke Illness (ILI)\xa0 and acute bronchitis occur. Between\xa0 1990–91 to 2004–05 respiratory admissions of\xa0 ≥65 years in England and Wales were analysed. The\xa0 ILI peaked was highly variable: the earliest during mid-November (week 46, 1993–94) and the latest, late February/early March (week 7, 1997–98).\n\nDiamond Princess Cruise Ship\n\nOn the\xa0Diamond Princess, six deaths occurred out of 705 who tested positive constituting a CFR\xa0 of 0.85%. All six deaths six occurred in patients > 70. No one under 70 died.\n\nEstimating COVID-19 CFR\n\nOur current best assumption, as of the 17th March, is the CFR in > 70s is approximately 1%. In the total population, it’s about 0.125%.\n\nHow do we arrive at this CFR figure?\xa0\n\nThe current COVID outbreak seems to be following previous pandemics in that initial CFRs start high and then trend downward. In Wuhan, for instance, the CFR\xa0 has gone down from 17% in the initial phase to near 1% in the late stage. Current testing strategies are also not capturing everybody: at least 50% on Diamond Princess were asymptomatic who usually wouldn’t get a test; in South Korea, considerable numbers who tested positive were also asymptomatics.\xa0 Asymptomatic people and mild cases are likely driving the rapid worldwide spread.\xa0 Early CFR rates are subject to selection bias as more severe cases are tested – generally those in the hospital settings or those with more severe symptoms. Mortality in children seems to be near zero (unlike flu) which will drive down the CFR significantly. In Swine flu, the CFR was fivefold less than the lowest estimate in the 1st ten weeks (0.1%)\n\nTherefore, to estimate the CFR, we used the lowest estimate, currently Germany’s 0.25%, and halved this based on the assumption that half the cases go undetected by testing and none of this group dies. Our assumptions, however, do not account for some exceptional cases, as in Italy, where the population is older, smoking rates are higher and antibiotic resistance is the highest in Europe, which all can act to increase the CFR. It is also not clear if the presence of other circulating influenza illnesses acts to increase the CFR and whether certain populations (e.g., those with heart conditions) are more at increased risk.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nThanks to David Bernstein (George Mason University) for posing the question of how we arrived at the CFR of 0.1%.\n\nWe welcome more critiques/questions on this article, and we are keeping the CFR under daily review.\n\n\xa0\n\nDisclaimer:\xa0 the article has not been peer-reviewed, and the sources cited should be checked.

By 1975, Graham Ayliffe in Birmingham had devised a way of hand-washing that covered every part of the fingers and hands.\xa0 He described this as follows:\n\n“The preparation [of antiseptic detergent or liquid soap] was applied for 30 seconds by a standard procedure, consisting of five strokes backwards and forwards: palm to palm, right palm over left dorsum, left palm over right dorsum, palm to palm with fingers interlaced, backs of fingers to opposing palm with fingers interlocked, rotational rubbing of right thumb clasped over left palm and left thumb clasped over right palm, rotational rubbing backwards and forwards with clasped fingers of right hand in\xa0 palm of left hand and clasped fingers of left hand in palm of right hand; hands and wrists were rubbed until the end of the 30-second period, then rinsed under a running tap for 15 seconds and dried, with two paper towels, for 15 seconds.”\n\nThis remains the standard technique for hand hygiene with soap and water or other disinfectant products.\n\nInitial studies of handwashing assessed efficacy by observing the reduction in bacterial counts, using a logarithmic scale. A reduction of 2 log units means that 99% of bacteria have been removed, of 3 log units means that 99.9% of bacteria have been removed, and so on. Test methods for viruses have been developed more recently.\n\nCoronaviruses have a viral envelope, which makes them potentially susceptible to surface-active agents such as soap and alcohol. In vitro,\xa0 several hand-rub products with an alcohol content of at least 75% reduced SARS-CoV-1 virus load by at least 4 log units and wine vinegar and 70% ethanol reduced SARS-CoV-1 load by more than 3 log units. It seems reasonable to extrapolate these results to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn a study of over 20,000 person-years, outpatient visits for respiratory illness were 45% lower among army recruits who washed their hand at least five times a day compared with controls. Jefferson et al reviewed physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. They reported an odds ratio of 0.54 for respiratory infections in those who washed their hands frequently, compared with controls.\n\nTaken together, the studies support the view that frequent and careful handwashing will reduce the chances of catching COVID-19.\n\nCochrane\xa0 review\n\nJefferson\xa0\xa0T, Del Mar\xa0\xa0CB, Dooley\xa0\xa0L, Ferroni\xa0\xa0E, Al‐Ansary\xa0\xa0LA, Bawazeer\xa0\xa0GA, van Driel\xa0\xa0ML, Nair\xa0\xa0S, Jones\xa0\xa0MA, Thorning\xa0\xa0S, Conly\xa0\xa0JM.
