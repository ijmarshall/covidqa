COVID-19
An emotional and psychological survival guide
We are living through unprecedented times. The rapid spread of the coronavirus is affecting us all mentally, if not physically. Despite crazy times like these (or perhaps because of times like these), it's even more important that we look after our own mental health.
Doctors and healthcare staff are at the frontline. As well as coping with the anxiety that is felt by the general population, we are coping with the uncertainty of what the next few days are going to bring us at work; concerns about how we are going to look after our most vulnerable patients; and the prospect of our colleagues becoming ill too.
But healthcare workers are remarkably resilient. We know how to do a great job under pressure, and we have an amazing ability to pull it out of the bag in times of extreme workload and stress. To be able to continue to do this, we need to stay as mentally healthy as possible. Read this PEARL and watch the special edition of the You Are Not A Frog podcast (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2LQEpJPfcM&feature=youtu.be) to hear Rachel Morris (YANAF podcast host and one of our Lead. Manage. Thrive! course authors and presenters) and Caroline Walker (a Psychiatrist and The Joyful Doctor) talk about how doctors can manage their own stress and anxiety throughout this crisis.
We'd love to hear your suggestions about other resources that would help supports you in doing the best job you can.
Remember, you are not superhuman, you can only do your best....and you are awesome. Thank you.

Are there any high-risk features that should alert us to consider bladder or renal cancer?

Are there any high-risk features that should alert us to consider bladder or renal cancer?
Regarding the risk of primary care symptoms for all urological cancers, the only high-risk feature in primary care is visible haematuria.
Having said this, not all patients with bladder or renal cancer experience visible haematuria. So, how do we determine who we should refer for further investigation? And when might non-visible haematuria be significant?
We will look closely at issues around prostate cancer in next week’s webinar being run in association with Macmillan Cancer Support. But meanwhile, as a urological cancer taster…..
There are 10,000 new cases of bladder cancer (the incidence is decreasing) and nearly 13,000 new cases of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma) per year in the UK. Around 50% of people survive these cancers for 10 or more years.
It is estimated that about one-third of cases of bladder and renal cancer are preventable. The major risk factors for bladder and kidney cancers include:
Smoking.
Overweight and obesity.
Occupational exposure to industrial chemicals, e.g. aromatic amines found in the dye, textile, pesticide and rubber industries (bladder cancer only).
Family history of an affected first-degree relative.
Radiation exposure, e.g. pelvic irradiation for other cancers.
Schistosomiasis for bladder cancer (rare in UK population).
Regarding the risk of primary care symptoms for all urological cancers, the only high-risk feature in primary care was visible haematuria, with a PPV of 5.1% in a BJGP study.
Having said this, not all patients with bladder or renal cancer experience visible haematuria, so, if investigations are restricted to this group alone, some diagnoses will inevitably be delayed. The low PPV of other symptoms, even in clusters, makes selecting other groups for urgent investigation difficult.
For non-visible haematuria in those over 60y, the PPV is >3 only if also presenting with dysuria or with a raised WBC count.
Antiplatelets and anticoagulants may contribute to haematuria, but for those with non-visible haematuria on these medications, 10% will have pathology (this is in line with the background population). So, we should not attribute haematuria to these drugs without investigating.
Women experience more delays in diagnosis of bladder cancer than men.
Remember, bladder cancer is an industrial disease for a small proportion of patients, and they may be entitled to compensation.
Also remember to store test sticks in the correct container with the lid closed – prolonged exposure to air or damp may give a false positive result. Check the guidance for the brand you use in your surgery, and check expiry dates!

What do we need to consider when we are asked for a prescription to postpone periods?

What do we need to consider when we are asked for a prescription to postpone periods?
Partial metabolism of norethisterone to ethinyloestadiol means that we should be thinking carefully when asked to prescribe norethisterone in order to postpone periods. What is the risk, and what are the main contraindications?
Given the sheer array of problems women can have with their periods (which we will be covering in detail in our Deep Dive webinar), it isn’t surprising that sometimes we get requests to postpone menstruation. These requests may relate to holiday plans or be for other reasons.
Discussions about the length of the holiday and prescribing the appropriate quantity of norethisterone take a short amount of time.
We might even prescribe on request without such a discussion. But should we be thinking this through more carefully?
MHRA guidance highlights important contraindications. Partial metabolism to ethinyloestadiol means that, at therapeutic doses, we need to be thinking about VTE risk and assessing this as we would for combined hormonal preparations.

Tight foreskins – what can we do short of circumcision?
Phimosis may be simply physiological and cause no problems. It may be secondary to an underlying skin disease. So, what do we need to look for, and what are the treatment options?
Phimosis may be physiological. It may be primary. It may be secondary to an underlying skin disorder. Whichever of these, and whether child or adult, your patient is likely to feel embarrassed about discussing the problem and awkward about physical examination.
If asymptomatic, it requires no treatment. But if it does require treatment, what should we offer? When might topical corticosteroids be appropriate and when should we refer?

The CTKUB scan showed a single small renal stone. However, that wasn't the only thing on the scan result: it reports a small lesion in the right adrenal gland, but unfortunately doesn't give you any advice on what to do next! So, what do you do?
You request a CTKUB. By the time you get the result, the patient has already rung to tell you that have ""passed the little blighter"", and indeed the scan showed a single small stone that was likely to come out on its own. However, that wasn't the only thing on the scan result: it reports a small lesion in the right adrenal gland, but unfortunately doesn't give you any advice on what to do next! So what do you do?
All adrenal incidentlomas need referring to endocrinology but take a history first: features such as hypertension, flushes or Cushingoid appearance that are pertinent to the referral may affect how quickly the patient is seen.
Most (85%) are benign and produce no hormones.
Lesionsour job is to refer!

The options for treatment of actinic keratosis include topical and physical treatments, depending on the grading and location of the lesions. In January 2020, the marketing authorisation for ingenol was suspended due to risk of skin malignancy.
We are asked to stop prescribing ingenol and consider other treatment options, as appropriate. So, what is the best treatment?
There are several options for the treatment of actinic keratosis, including topical and physical treatments, depending on the grading and location of the lesions. But what is the best treatment?
A 2019 NEJM article looked at the effectiveness of four treatments that are field-directed: 5% fluorouracil cream, 5% imiquimod cream, photodynamic therapy and 0.015% ingenol mebutate gel.
5% fluorouracil cream was shown to be the best – and is the cheapest!
Is fluorouracil the first-line agent in your area?
Note that in January 2020, the marketing authorisation for ingenol was suspended due to risk of skin malignancy. We are asked to stop prescribing ingenol and consider other treatment options, as appropriate. We are also asked to advise patients to be vigilant for any skin lesions developing within the treatment area, and to seek medical advice promptly should any occur.
Has your local formulary/prescribing guideline been updated to reflect this change?

How confident do you feel when it comes to treating gout?

How confident do you feel when it comes to treating gout?
When we are now encouraged to start disease-modifying treatment following a first attack of gout, how can we be confident enough in our diagnosis to recommend urate-lowering treatment?
You might be confident based on your clinical judgement to start a course of treatment for an attack of gout, but are you confident enough to be recommending disease-modifying treatment with a first attack? When might diagnostic tests be indicated, and, importantly, does primary care scoring system that does not require aspiration perform better than clinical judgement alone?
Pete, age 58y, limps into your consulting room. “My big toe is killing me”, he says. “The same thing happened about a year ago but it went away with taking ibuprofen for a few days. Now I think this might be gout.”
Pete has hypertension which is controlled with ramipril. His right first MTP joint is red, swollen, warm and painful to move.
You feel confident, based on clinical assessment, to manage this episode as an attack of gout, but recall reading that we should start urate-lowering treatment after a first attack of gout. Are you confident enough to recommend disease-modifying treatment for Pete?
And what if you were less certain about the diagnosis, for example if it were his ankle affected rather than MTP joint? When do you need to consider diagnostic tests? Should you be considering joint aspiration?
For a typical attack, clinical features have a high likelihood ratio of being correct. However, a scoring system can improve accuracy of diagnosis. Pete will want to know that you are confident about your diagnosis if you are suggesting that he needs disease-modifying treatment. There is a primary care scoring system that does not require aspiration and that performs better than clinical judgement alone.

Are prophylactic antibiotics effective for recurrent UTI in the elderly?
A study looking at patients over the age of 65y with a history of recurrent UTI found that use of prophylactic antibiotics reduced the risk of recurrent UTI by 51% in women and 43% in men. But there is more to this story!
A study looking at patients over the age of 65y with a history of recurrent UTI found that use of prophylactic antibiotics reduced the risk of recurrent UTI by 51% in women and 43% in men. This had a corresponding effect of a 22% reduction in UTI-related hospital admission in men, but this was not seen in women.
Of those who did get antibiotics, more than 50% took them for over 2 years!
This study did not look at antibiotic-related adverse events or at rates of resistant bacteria in urine, and the data is reliant on accurate read-coding of UTI diagnoses in primary care, so we cannot comment on the possible harms of prophylactic antibiotics for recurrent UTI in the elderly from these results.
So, food for thought when you next discuss recurrent UTIs with an older person, or do theo=ir medication review and see they have been on the antibiotic for 2 years!

Understanding the different roles in the ARRS
Like it or loathe it, the PCN seems here to stay, though whether primary care stays with DES is a different matter altogether!
One of the opportunities of the DES is the potential to integrate new roles into primary care to help solve some of the key challenges that many of us are facing, particularly shortage of GPs and increasing patient demand. This is also known as the Additional Role Reimbursement Scheme or ARRS.
Regardless of the outcome of the DES specification consultation and our individual practice choices about whether to participate, multidisciplinary primary care may be a good pragmatic option for many of our teams.
But this represents a big change and, like all change, if managed badly, it will cause more stress, disillusionment and wasted time. So, we need some pointers to make it work.
We are offering some resources and support to make this as easy as possible for you. You will find here one of a series of articles designed to help you navigate the complexities of this process of employing and utilising new professional groups within your team.
Done well, it may actually be the best thing to happen to primary care in years. So, what is the ARRS and how might it help us?
What should we advise for children with diarrhoea and vomiting?

What should we advise for children with diarrhoea and vomiting?
NICE advises us to offer oral rehydration solution to those 'at increased risk' of dehydration. But is oral hydration solution better than fruit juice for children with diarrhoea and vomiting?
""I've tried to get Jimmy to drink the oral rehydration solution, but he spits it out. I tasted it and I don't blame it - it tastes awful!""
NICE advises us to offer oral rehydration solution to those 'at increased risk' of dehydration.
A Canadian study looked at whether oral rehydration solution is better than fruit juice for children with diarrhoea and vomiting. The group treated with dilute aplle juice was less likely to end up needing IV fluids than the group treated with oral rehydration solution!
However, 68% of the children in the trial showed no signs of dehydration, and the rest of the group showed only mild dehydration.
So, what can we tell from this?
We can stop using oral rehydration solution 'just in case' in non-dehydrated children with gastroenteritis.
There had previously been concerns that the high sugar content in fruit juice might increase diarrhoea, but this was not shown in this study.
For children with any clinical signs of moderate dehydration, oral rehydration solution may still be the most appropriate option PROVIDING the child will drink it!

What should you consider when your patient says, “I’m still coughing”?
You've done a chest X-ray, treated them for reflux, given them a nasal spray to treat any post-nasal dip, and they are still coughing. What next?
First, get the patient to demonstrate their 'cough' as it might not be a cough after all!
Asthma, reflux and ACE inhibitors are the most common culprits.
Pay careful attention to red flags (in particular dyspnoea, haemoptysis, hoarseness, weight loss, fever, dysphagia and chest pain).
And don't forget to consider non-respiratory as well as respiratory causes.
The list of causes to consider is long but you don't have to remember it - just 'Red Whale it' when you need the info by looking for Cough: chronic article.

Winter’s back and so are patients presenting with sinusitis. So how can we change our practice on this? Read our article here: And join us for our webinar - Top 10 practice-changing points of 2019 – to hear about this and much more! Register here
Sinusitis is part of the ‘bread and butter’ of primary care. Is there anything new? Anything that will radically change your practice? Yes, there is!
The 2017 NICE guidelines suggest:
Sinusitis is a self-limiting illness in most and usually lasts about 2–3w. Nothing new here!
Antibiotics make very little difference to duration of symptoms, probably because less than 2% of cases are complicated by bacterial infection. Again, nothing new here.
If you have to use antibiotics, and this will be a big change in practice, use phenoxymethylpenicillin for 5d because it is narrower spectrum than amoxicillin.
This change is one of our top 10 tips for 2019.

How do you handle a possible upper GI bleed?
Your patient admits drinking too much and presents with epigastric pain. He also tells you he recently took ibuprofen for a painful shoulder. Could it be an acute upper GI bleed? What do you do next?
""I never look at my poo, I just flush it away"", says Tony in response to your question trying to ascertain whether he has melaena. Tony is a 46-year-old who admits drinking more than he should and presents with epigastric pain. He took some ibuprofen last week for a painful shoulder. So, has Tony had an acute GI bleed?
Acute upper GI bleeding is common and serious, with 10% mortality. Peptic ulcer is the most common cause, followed by gastritis/duodenitis.
In the acute phase, a normal haemoglobin and normal blood pressure do not rule out a substantial bleed so we should not be reassured if these are normal. A raised pulse rate is more sensitive.
The bottom line is, we should refer all patients with a good history.
So, what are you going to do with Tony?
And what about management after an acute upper GI bleed? Can your patient ever again use NSAIDS? And what if they were on antiplatelets or anticoagulation?
Click on the PDF for our summary of a 2018 BMJ review regarding acute upper GI bleeds. We hope this summary will help you think through any such clinical dilemmas.

What are the alternative to opiates and gabapentinoids for our patients?
Our understanding of the neurobiology of pain has completely revolutionised over the last few years. And because of that, lots of alternative management strategies for persistent pain have also emerged.
Read more below about managing chronic pain and for even more resources, watch our FREE chronic pain webinar!
A cry we are hearing a lot on our GP Update and MSK courses at the moment is, ""We can't use opiates, we can't use gabapentinoids, what can we use for patients with chronic pain?"".
Unfortunately, there is not a quick-fix, easy answer: no single tablet that will cure chronic pain. But there is a lot we can do. Our understanding of the neurobiology of chronic pain has changed beyond recognition since many of us were at medical school. In our next VA webinar, we will unpack this and start to talk about consultation strategies, specific self-mangement skills and great resources.
The International Association for the Study of Pain (ASP) defines pain as: an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.
This definition contains several important elements:
Pain is an experience, i.e it is subjective.
Pain is both a sensation and has an emotional aspect.
Tissue damage is not necessary for pain to exist.
The patient's description of their pain may be the same whether or not the tissue damage is present.
Nocicption is the neural process of encoding noxious stimuli. It is triggered when noxious stimuli act on specialised peripheral nerve endings.
However:
It does not necessarily result in the individual perceiving pain.
It is also possible for an individual to perceive pain when there is nociception. This occurs in some chronic pain states.
Most clinicians and lay people continue to view pain according to the biomedical model. We in primary care treat teh physical, psychological and social problems of our patients on a daily basis, and use the biopsychosocial model routinely for medical problems such as depression or anxiety. A biopsychosocial approach to patients with chronic pain is essential in understanding and treating their pain effectively.

How does varicoceles affect male infertility?
Varicoceles happen in 15% of adolescent boys & men. Two thirds have no fertility problems, but for others it's linked to reduced sperm quality. What do you when a patient is experiencing infertility or worried about it?
You have reassured Charlie that the swelling he felt in his scrotum is just a varicocele and is not cancer. However, he still looks anxious and asks, ""will this mean I cannot have a child?"".
Varicoceles are common, occurring in 15% of adolescent boys and men. Two-thirds of men with a varicocele do not have problems with fertility, though varicoceles do increase scrotal temperature, reduce testicular perfusion, and are associated with reduced sperm quality in observational studies.
Embolisation of large varicoceles may improve sperm quality. However, NICE concludes that varicocele surgery should not be offered as fertility treatment because it does not improve pregnancy rates.
Infertility is the failure to conceive after >1y of reguar unprotected sex. One in seven couples in teh UK access infertility treatent. Abnominal semen analysis occurs in nearly half of couples with infertility.
Male infertility can be caused by hormonal, testicular or obstructive factors, or may be functional. No cause is identified in a third of cases. Where possible identification of the underlying cause can help guide advice, investigation and referral.
If semen analysis is abnormal, we should repeat the sample and advise regarding reversible causes of semen abnormalities, assess for the underlying cause of male infertility, arrange bloods and if clinically appropriate an ultrasoud scan. We can then refer to fertility services along with referral to endocrinology/urology, as required.

How do you know when an acute asthma exacerbation is severe or life-threatening?
What are the protocols and what should we do about management? Check out this handy summary of protocols we created, which you might even want to stick on your treatment room wall!
We should treat every attendance with an asthma exacerbation as severe asthma until proven otherwise.
So, what suggests that an acute asthma exacerbation is severe or life threatening?
PEFR is an important indicator, and we need to be able to measure oxygen saturation, but we should not rely on a single sign. We must look at the whole picture.
And then, for management:
How should we give sabutamol? Should we give oxygen? Should we give prednisolone? Should we give antibiotics?
And then, for management:
How should we give salbutamol? Should we give oxygen? Should we give prednisolone? Should we give antibiotics? When should we admit?

How do we manage lung cancer in primary care?
UK lung cancer survival rates lag a long way behind some of Europe and we need to make earlier diagnoses. How can we change our practice?
We've teamed up with Macmillan to bring you this Pearl and free webinar on Lung Cancer.
We can make earlier diagnosis in primary care by:
Improving patients awareness of symptoms - 'Be Clear on Cancer' has done this.
Having a low threshold for referring for CXR in at-risk patients - CXRs are cheap, widely available and relatively harm-free!
Not being falsely reassured by negative CXR in patients with persistent symptoms.
Remember, beware the negative CXR - if we still have a degree of suspicion, we should refer!
So, when should we order a chest radiograph?
Lung cancer does not always present with a clear symptom signature, and affected individuals often have comorbidities that could confuse the picture. While haemoptysis is the most predictive isolated symptom, it only occurs in 20% of those with a final diagnosis of lung cancer. Remember more unusual presentations such as thrombocytosis, appetite loss, shoulder pain and worsening spirometry, especially in smokers. NICE offers clear guidance on how we should approach patients presenting with symptoms that could be suggestive of lung cancer.
And remember too that stopping smoking is beneficial at any stage, even after a diagnosis of lung cancer.
Click on the PDF button to see our summary of NICE guidance and recent BMJ and BJGP articles on the diagnosis of lung cancer.
Yes, our headline about UK survival rates from lung cancer sounds depressing. But there is hope in the form of screening for earlier detection and evolving innovative immunotherapy-based treatments. Our key challenges in primary care are prevention through smoking cessation, helping patients spot it early and supporting patients through ever-more-complex regimens.

Subclinical hypothyroidism – overdiagnosis or worth treating?
It’s a dilemma in patients with a raised TSH and normal T4: a small % develop overt hypothyroidism, but many will see their TSH levels normalise over 2 years. What should we do?
We have several dilemmas when we encounter a raised TSH with normal T4. Each year, a small percentage of these patients will develop overt hypothyroidism. But with a single raised TSH of less than 7mIU/L, there is a 50% chance of the level normalising over 2 years.
What about CHD risk? A meta-analysis has shown that, overall, there was no difference in CHD incidence, CHD mortality or overall mortality between those with subclinical hypothyroidism and those who were euthyroid. However, those who had a TSH ≥10mU/L at presentation had a significantly increased risk of CHD and CHD mortality, but no difference in overall mortality.
There is evidence that treating subclinical hypothyroidism does not improve symptoms or quality of life.
There is insufficient data to look at whether treatment reduces the risk of CVD.
So, is this overdiagnosis? Shared decision-making and monitoring rather than treating is a very reasonable option until the evidence catches up and definitively guides us as to whether there are long-term benefits of treatment.
Please note: this does not apply to pregnant women for whom treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is still recommended.

What’s the evidence on linking hormonal contraception to depression?

What’s the evidence on linking hormonal contraception to depression?
Some research links hormonal contraception with increased antidepressant use, and even suicide. But does the evidence support this?
""Can I change to a different pill?"", Abigail asks. ""I have been having terrible mood swings. It all seems to be since I started the pill 3 months ago. This is just not like me. My partner and friends have noticed it and are worried. It must be the pill.""
So, what is the evidence around hormonal contraception and depression? And how will you advise Abigail?
Research from Scandanavia has found that use of hormonal contraception may be associated with increased antidepressant use and an increased risk of suicide.
The FRSH points out that there are limitations to studies in this area, and they do not prove a casual link between hormonal contraceptive use and depression.
Mood disorders in women may be mutifactorial.
A history of depression is NOT a contraindication (UKMEC 1) to any method of contraception.
Offering women contraceptive choice reduces the risk of an unintended pregnancy which could worsen her mental health.
We should counsel women about possible side-effects of hormonal contraception - including mood changes - and offer an alternative if a specific method is causing problems.
For more on the studies that have looked at this, the evidence, and how this should affect our practice:

What’s all the fuss about FIT?

What’s all the fuss about FIT?
Several indications for use, different cut-off thresholds for different uses...We summarise the NICE guidance, BJGP and other articles on the use of the faecal immunochemical test.
The faecal immunochemical test (FIT) is a new way to test for occult blood in stool. It is replacing the traditional guaiac-based faecal occult stool test.
FIT can detect human haemoglobin in stool at very low levels. It has a much lower false positive rate than guaiac testing because it is not influenced by food consumed. It is specific for lower GI blood loss and requires one test, rather than three – so, if your patient is sent just one test kit, the FIT is being used. It is a quantitative test so the amount of blood in the stool can also be determined. This allows different thresholds to be set which will adjust the sensitivity and specificity of the test.
There are three ways the FIT test can be used, each of which involves different cut-off thresholds being applied.
Colorectal cancer screening: FIT is the screening test of choice for the national screening programme from 2019.
Patients with ‘low-but-not-no-risk’ symptoms for colorectal cancer: used as a ‘rule-in’ test. Those testing positive are most likely to benefit from an urgent colonoscopy. A negative FIT makes a diagnosis of colorectal cancer unlikely BUT, if symptoms persist, further investigations (for colorectal or other cancers) should be considered: safety-net well.
To triage 2ww colonoscopy list: as a rule-out test for patients with higher risk symptoms who meet referral criteria. This is controversial and is not part of standard practice yet. It is being tested in large clinical trials to see if it is safe to use in this context.
NICE updated its ‘Suspected cancer referral guidelines’ to recommend the FIT rather than the guaiac FOB test. NICE says we can offer faecal immunochemical testing to assess for colorectal cancer in people without rectal bleeding who have unexplained symptoms that could be suggestive of colorectal cancer but who meet no other referral criteria, allowing us the freedom to decide when the test might be appropriate and to refer if positive.

Do emollients really pose a fire risk?

Do emollients really pose a fire risk?
Emollients are the mainstay of treatment for eczema. But people do die from emollient-associated fires and it’s that time of year when people switch their heating on. What should we advise patients?
People can, and do, die from fire associated with emollient use.
In 2018, the MHRA recommended that patients should be given 'clear advice not to smoke or go near naked flames, and information about the risk of severe burn injury or death when clothing, bedding and dressings with emollients dried on them are accidentally ignited'.
This advice applies to all emollients, whether they contain paraffin or not.
Emollients are the mainstay of treatment for everyone with eczema. They should continue to be used when stepping up treatment.
Autumn is here and patients will be starting to turn on their heating - so now may be the time to think about fire risk and advise patients.

Osteoarthritis: which treatments work and how do we encourage self management?

Osteoarthritis: which treatments work and how do we encourage self management?
Osteoarthritis is extremely common and a growing problem in the UK. We spend between 1 and 2.5% of our GDP on the direct costs of this condition and the indirect costs are likely to be even higher.
And yet, many patients with osteoarthritis report feeling unsupported and feel they have to ‘accept’ their arthritis as an inevitable part of ageing.
Primary care can make a big difference to patients with osteoarthritis, but what can we say, and how we say it, really matters. The old adage of 'wear and tear' just doesn't fit the bill. If we think about it, phrases like this imply an inevitable need for surgery and don't make it particularly likely that our patients will engage in exercise and movement...I mean, if your brakes are 'worn and torn', you don't want to take the car out for a long drive.
So, what can we do instead? How can we share understanding of the condition and help patients to engage in self-management? What core treatments do work and where can we access them?
We have teamed up with Versus Arthritis to bring you a Pearl on osteoarthritis – it’s a long one but worth digesting with a nice cup of tea. And we've produced a free webinar: Osteoarthritis: primary care matters, watch on demand today.
How do we tackle addiction to prescribed drugs?

How do we tackle addiction to prescribed drugs?
Shocking headlines appeared in the press recently: ‘1 in 4 people take addictive medicines’, prompting ‘The NHS must take action!’. Where have these numbers come from, are they true, and what can we do?
'1 in 4 people take addictive medicines', finds a Public Health England review. The Mail Online says, 'The NHS must take action!'
So, where have these numbers come from - and what can we do?
These reports were based on PHE prescribing analysis using CPRD data from 2017. The analysis looked at 5 drug classes: antidepressants, benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, opiods and gabapentinoids.
In 12 months between 2017 and 2018, 11.5 million adults in the UK were prescribed at least one of these drugs. To put this into context, this means around 17% of the adult population were being prescribed antidepressants and around 3% were being prescribed gabapentinoids. These prescription rates are higher in women, and higher in areas of deprivation.
The average duration of prescription has gone up from 3 months to over 12 months since the last evaluation in 2015. This report also attracted a fair bit of controversy about whether antidepressants should have been lumped indiscriminately in with these other drug classes, and this is a legitimate point.
In light of these findings, PHE made several recommendations to the NHS to promote awareness of the harms of these drugs and better shared understanding with patients:
1. Make prescribing data more transparent and accessible (Ben Goldacre's site https://openprescribing.net/ is a good place to start if you want to find out about your own trends).
2. Improve patient information leaflets on these treatments.
3. Improve NHS support for patients with dependence on these drugs.
4. Do further research on prevention and treatment of dependence on prescribed drugs.
5. Set up a national drug dependence patient helpline.
While these aims are laudable, they don't give us, as clinicians on the ground, many useful tools we can use with our patients who are struggling with chronic pain.
At Red Whale, we recognise that managing chronic pain in primary care with limited resources is an area many of us fid challenging. Introducing the concept of self-care to patients can be difficult for us and patients. Our medical model is that we should be able to 'do something' for the patient, and the patient can perceive that the idea of self-care is suggesting they are 'wasting our time' or it is 'all in their heads'.
This is a complex area, so much so that we dedicate a whole course to it. But we would liek to share with you some of the strategies we have found helpful around introducing the concept of self-care. This is one part of the jigsaw.

Watch our fabulous one-day MSK & Chronic Pain Update course online. Get the latest evidence on condition management and strategies for supporting patients with chronic pain.
Everything you’d get from a one-day MSK & Chronic Pain Update Course, but you ditch the travel and watch it online - as little or as much in one go as you like! MSK conditions have the greatest impact on health of any medical condition in the UK after cardiovascular disease. So we created our MSK & Chronic Pain Course to make this vast and tricky area of primary care better for clinicians and patients alike.
As with a face to face course, you’ll also get 6 CPD credits for watching the course online and a copy of the printed Handbook posted to you. There’s also 12 months FREE access to the MSK & Chronic Pain resources on www.gpcpd.com. If you’ve not used it before it’s our online Handbook, in-consultation search engine and CPD tracker.
What we cover
We’ll look at why chronic pain can only be ‘in the brain’ and how we explain this to our patients and we’ll cover the big topics:
Osteoarthritis
Back pain
Inflammatory arthritis
Fibromyalgia
Hypermobility and much more.
This course does not include a MSK & Chronic Pain printed handbook. Please click here to purchase the MSK & Chronic Pain Update Online Course with a printed handbook.

Join Dr David Plume and guests as they discuss the many issues, guidelines, studies and effects around prostate cancer.
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in the UK with around 48,000 men a year diagnosed. It can cause premature death, but actually has quite low mortality rates even with advanced disease, unlike many of the cancers that we see.
It’s no surprise therefore that we see a lot of men who are either concerned about prostate cancer, are being treated or monitored with prostate cancer, or have had prostate cancer in the past and are now dealing with the consequences of treatment, and as we move to stratified follow up, and more low risk prostate cancer patients are followed up in the community rather than secondary care, we will see many more!
Join Cancer Course Director Dr David Plume in the Red Whale studio with co-host Dr Richard Simcock, Consultant Clinical Oncologist from Brighton and one of Macmillan’s Consultant Advisors, and our guest Dr Alison Birtle, Consultant Clinical Oncologist and Honorary Clinical Senior Lecturer from Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.
What we will cover:
Significant issues around the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer.
The NICE Guidelines on prostate cancer.
The STAMPEDE study and what this might mean for our patients.
Late and long term effects from prostate cancer treatment.

The lung cancer landscape is changing. Screening (or case finding!) and immunotherapies are shifting the tides a little more in favour of patients and there are some important things we need to know in primary care.
Lung cancer historically is something we have seen as a death sentence. We have had a fairly nihilistic view of it and this has been understandable given only 5% are potentially curable at diagnosis. However, screening and novel therapies mean one-year survival is starting to creep up and a small sub-set of patients are living with lung cancer as a long term condition.
This webinar will cover:
Lung cancer CT case finding (or screening!) is now a reality in many areas of the UK. Do you know how this works and what is means for you and your patients?
Novel immunotherapies are an option for a small sub-group of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and can radically alter the prognosis. But, they have significant toxicities that can occur many months down the line and present to us in primary care – would you spot them and know what to do?
How can we best support our patients with lung cancer: we offer some great resources.
Join our cancer course director, GP, David Plume and his guests in the Red Whale studio for the first in the second series of Red Whale cancer webinars in association with Macmillan Cancer Support to discuss this and much more. David will be joined by Dr Richard Simcock, ever-so-practical Consultant Clinical Oncologist from Brighton and Dr Tom Newsom-Davis, who is a Consultant Medical Oncologist at the Chelsea and Westminster specialising in thoracic malignancies and the vice chair of the British Thoracic Oncology Group Steering Committee. Between them, they should be able to answer all your questions!

Please note that we have made the tough decision of cancelling all our March courses and provide our delegates with the online version of the course.
CANCELLATION OF FACE to FACE Red Whale Courses
Many of us are concerned about the risks of COVID-19 transmission, how best we can ‘flatten the curve’ and protect ourselves , our families and patients. At Red Whale we have been thinking hard about how this should impact on our face to face courses.
Our top priority - as always - remains our delegates, team and patients safety, so after careful consideration, we have come to the tough decision to
cancel our face to face courses between March and June and provide our delegates with the online version of the course instead.
We haven’t taken the decision lightly. We considered all options but there are particular concerns with bringing large groups of health care professionals together at this stage in terms of transmission and the impact on NHS service provision.
Given that the course of the virus is likely to be prolonged and at present the annual appraisal cycle continues, delivering the product online allows responsible social distancing.
As you will be aware, this is a very difficult time for small businesses. We are doing everything we can at this time to offer the best customer service we are able to under these exceptional circumstances and we ask for your understanding.
WHAT TO DO if you are booked on a Red Whale course between March and June:
1-Please DO NOT TRAVEL to the venue on the day.
If your course is in March, you should have received an email telling you that the course you are booked on has been cancelled. The email was sent on 13 March and might have gone to spam or your ""other"" folder.
If your course is in May or June, we will be in contact very shortly as soon as we can.
2- When you receive your email please reply to the email you have received or email us at reply@red-whale.co.uk to acknowledge that you have received this information so we don’t continue to try and reach you unnecessarily.
WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT
1-
Over the next few days you will receive an email with instructions on how to access the online version of the Spring Summer 2020 course and watch it from 9th April onward.
2-
We will be in touch with you to let you know the dates of a number of FREE Live ‘Big Ask’ webinar to accompany the Online course.
WHAT WILL YOU GET
• The same 6 hours of practice-changing updates from the same great GP presenters you get on our one-day courses - available to watch from April 9th at your own pace, from your own home, as many times as you wish, for 12 months.
• A copy of the printed handbook sent to the address you entered at the time of placing your order.
• The same 12 months access to GPCPD.com you would expect from attending the course – to help you answer questions in real-time in consultations, access 500+ articles and find lots of further learning activities, reflection and QI/Audit.
• A series of FREE ‘Big Ask’ webinars to accompany the Online Course. This is your chance to ask any burning questions on the updates we covered on the course and hear answers to your colleagues' questions.
We have worked hard, in our award winning studio, to offer you the same interactive learning experience as you would on our face-to-face courses - with focussed learning activities, energisers and microskills to practice and much, much more.
We’re disappointed to have to do this but given the exceptional circumstances we all find ourselves in, we think this is the right thing to do.
Best wishes at this difficult time and stay well,
The Red Whale Team

An emotional and psychological survival guide (Part 1)
We are all finding things difficult at the moment. We are not alone. We are all struggling with this. Even if it feels like
you aren’t, you probably are. We can’t make it go away but we would like to offer you some suggestions.
In this, the first of what we hope will be a series of articles, we offer some simple tips on how we can stay well and
support each other as clinicians. This material is developed from the Red Whale Mental Health course and, from the
linked podcast, by our LMT presenter and Shapes Toolkit founder, Dr Rachel Morris, with Dr Caroline Walker, NHS Psy-
chiatrist, expert in doctor wellbeing and founder of The Joyful Doctor.
What is going on?
At the moment, most of us are in the early phases of anxiety of related to ‘what is yet to come’.
We can use the CBT model below to understand why we are feeling as we are at the moment. You may find it is af-
fecting any (or all!) of your thoughts, behaviours, feelings or physical sensations.
Think for a moment of where you find yourself at the moment. Which area(s) are you struggling with most?
Fight and flight mode
This is not a drill. Our minds are in full ‘threat, threat, threat…’ mode and our amygdalae are going crazy. If you are
familiar with The Chimp Paradox, our poor little chimps are screaming in their cages. They need to be heard and we
need to soothe them because, for many of us, a big part of our job is listening to and helping soothe the ‘chimps’
(amygdalae!) of our patients – and, at times, our colleagues. So, it is critical now, more than ever, that we practice
self-care.

What might help?
Get the basics right
Simple things will make a difference, and they are the very things we are likely to STOP doing at this time, but we need to help
each other to make sure we are looking after ourselves. This means we need to:
• Take regular breaks and use them for rest.
• Refuel: drink, eat.
• Go to the loo when you need to.
• Be kind to yourself and each other – situations like this bring our best and worst days.
• Connect with people at work – have a couple of 5–10-minute get togethers each day. Prioritise making it happen. You are
not responsible for the whole of society. You can only do so much. (At Red Whale, we have set up a daily virtual coffee
break for 15 minutes each day; anyone who is free can bring a coffee and join.)
Control what you can control (your behaviours)
• Social media: reduce the amount overall. Notice how it makes you feel and find your own balance. There is good and bad
– it can be helpful to reach out, connect and find support, but it can also escalate things.
• News updates: set specific and time-framed periods to look at the news, e.g. 10 minutes twice daily. Consider using the
press conferences.
• As far as possible, try to keep your usual routine and participate in usual activities, even if you have to be a bit creative,
e.g. virtual coffee with a friend, watching a family film and chatting about it by WhatsApp as it takes place, doing a HIIT
workout in the garden or indoors.
• Think of life one day at a time. What can you do to stay in the moment? – use mindfulness techniques (https://www.head-
space.com).
• Reach out in our communities to make connections and ask for help if you need it.
Don’t try to stop and control worrying thoughts…it’s impossible
In this situation, worrying thoughts are normal and we can’t suppress them. But we can avoid going down the rabbit hole.
Strategies that might help include changing our relationship with those thoughts by noticing them and using strategies such as:
• Distraction (see below).
• Worry time (see below).
• Mindfulness.
• Sharing the thoughts to normalise them: talk to others about your thoughts and feelings. This in itself may help.
• Completing a gratitude journal where you identify 3 things each day that you are grateful for. Gratitude is a great antidote
for anxiety as it is (almost) impossible to feel both things at the same time.
• Challenging (re-framing) the thoughts, e.g. my mum is going to die, what if I get it and die, how will my kids cope, what will
my funeral be like... Look at the balance of evidence for the REAL rather than mind-created risk. then reframe it, e.g. the
story I’m telling myself is: I am going to die and my children will be left without a mother, and compare this with the reality:
It is unlikely I will die; I am relatively young and have no other health problems.
Microskill: distraction
Distraction is a useful short-term way of stopping ourselves getting overly caught up in negative thoughts or worries
about an unknown future. Use it when you are finding it difficult to stop thinking or worrying. It does not involve try-
ing to suppress negative thoughts, but instead helps you to actively focus your attention on a different activity.
Type of distraction activity Examples…
Exercise and activity Go for a walk or bike ride; put on the radio and dance; walk briskly up the stairs; stretch or
do yoga; go for a jog; do some vigorous cleaning.
Be creative Draw, paint or sculpt; write in your diary; sing; play a musical instrument; knit; sew; carry
out a DIY project.
Connect with others Phone or text a friend; help someone else; go to a public place; have a hug from someone
special; talk about your problems with someone you trust; call a helpline.
Soothing and calming Take a bath or shower; stroke a pet; have a warm drink; have a massage; listen to soothing
music; practice meditation, mindfulness or relaxation activities.
Constructive activities Send an important email; spend 10 minutes tidying or organising; cook or bake; garden;
write a 'to-do' list; volunteer your time.
Activities requiring concentra-
tion
Do a puzzle, crossword or sudoku; play solitaire, computer games or apps; watch a movie
or a funny video clip.
Self-care Paint your nails; apply some moisturiser; put on a nice outfit; write down something you
like about yourself and something you are grateful for.
Release Clench an ice-cube; sprint for 30 seconds on the spot; snap a band on your wrist; punch a
pillow or a punch-bag; listen to loud music.
Microskill: worry time
Worry time is a way of coping with excessive worrying. It involves learning to postpone worrying, or put it ‘on hold’
until a more convenient time. This will lead to worrying becoming less intrusive and will give us a greater sense of con-
trol.
The steps for using worry time are outlined below – it takes practise!
Steps for ‘worry time’
• Choose a worry time: plan a regular period of 15–30 minutes for worrying each day, ideally at the same time and in the
same place. Try to avoid doing this just before bedtime.
• Notice when a worry pops into your mind: if you notice that you have started worrying at any time outside the planned
worry time, tell yourself: It’s OK to have this worry, but I’m going to put off thinking about it until my worry time. I will have
time to think about it later. I will be able to deal with this problem later.
• Note down your worries: you might find it helpful to carry a notebook to quickly write down the worry thought, and then
close the book until worry time. Don’t be concerned if the same thought pops back again very quickly. It is very common to
experience repeated worry thoughts. Just repeat the same process: accept the thought, write it down and then postpone it
for later.
• Focus on your daily life: after noting down your worry, close the book, focus your attention back onto the present moment
and concentrate on whatever activity you are carrying out. This will help to let go of the worry until worry time arrives later
on.
• Review your worries during worry time: when it comes to your planned worry time, you can look through your list of wor-
ries. Cross anything off the list that is no longer a worry for you. Allow yourself to worry for up to 30 minutes. Try to also
focus on some problem-solving ideas by asking yourself: Is there anything I can do to help this situation?
• Move on to another activity: don’t spend any longer than planned during worry time. Afterwards, try to move quickly onto
another activity that is likely to take your mind away from your worries and lift your mood, such as exercise, listening to
music or calling a friend.

The lung cancer landscape is changing. Screening (or case finding!) and immunotherapies are shifting the tides a little more in favour of patients and there are some important things we need to know in primary care.
Lung cancer historically is something we have seen as a death sentence. We have had a fairly nihilistic view of it and this has been understandable given only 5% are potentially curable at diagnosis. However, screening and novel therapies mean one-year survival is starting to creep up and a small sub-set of patients are living with lung cancer as a long term condition.
This webinar will cover:
Lung cancer CT case finding (or screening!) is now a reality in many areas of the UK. Do you know how this works and what is means for you and your patients?
Novel immunotherapies are an option for a small sub-group of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and can radically alter the prognosis. But, they have significant toxicities that can occur many months down the line and present to us in primary care – would you spot them and know what to do?
How can we best support our patients with lung cancer: we offer some great resources.
Join our cancer course director, GP, David Plume and his guests in the Red Whale studio for the first in the second series of Red Whale cancer webinars in association with Macmillan Cancer Support to discuss this and much more. David will be joined by Dr Richard Simcock, ever-so-practical Consultant Clinical Oncologist from Brighton and Dr Tom Newsom-Davis, who is a Consultant Medical Oncologist at the Chelsea and Westminster specialising in thoracic malignancies and the vice chair of the British Thoracic Oncology Group Steering Committee. Between them, they should be able to answer all your questions!

This is a rapidly-evolving area and this information is a guide only, to help you think and plan ahead. If you have
contact with a patient with, or concerned about, COVID-19, you MUST check the relevant government websites to
ensure you are following the latest guidance. This document was last updated at 7am Wednesday 18th March 2020.
UPDATED! Checklist for primary care
Oversight and leadership
Appoint a COVID-19 lead to oversee the implementation of all things relating to coronavirus.
Are you checking regularly what the latest definitions and advice are?
Avoiding exposure in the first place
The NHS advice to patients with FEVER OR NEW CONTINUOUS COUGH is that they should NOT present to primary
care but use online 111 advice, and call 111 only if they cannot cope with their symptoms at home, they are getting
worse or their symptoms are not improving after 7 days; 111 will then arrange appropriate care.
To reduce the chance of someone turning up with the infection in the first place:
Have you got information on your website?
Have you got notices on your doors?
Are reception staff screening patients as they book in/on arrival?
Are you screening all people requesting home visits by phoning ahead and checking symptoms?
How will you manage online bookings to ensure patients are screened before attending?
Advice to patients
Have you communicated key information to patients about what to do if coronavirus is suspected?
Do you have clear advice for those advised to ‘stay at home’?
Keeping patients safe
Does everyone in the practice know what to do if:
Someone contacts the practice with respiratory symptoms but no travel/contact history?
Someone presents at reception with suspected COVID-19?
A suspected case is identified during a consultation?
Someone with suspected COVID-19 needs immediate care/immediate transfer to hospital?
Preparedness
Be prepared:
Identify an isolation room and declutter it now.
Prepare a patient 'support pack' for this room.
Do staff have appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)?
Do staff know how to correctly put on/remove PPE?
Do staff know how to dispose of this PPE after use?
Do staff know how to decontaminate a room after use?
Do those who do home visits have PPE and TWO clinical waste bags in their vehicle?
Key documents
NHS England Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for primary care have now been produced; this article is based
on the SOPs, and our services should be modelled on these (as published on 6/3/20, summarised in this article and
available here): https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/20200305-COVID-19-PRIMARY-CARE-
SOP-GP-PUBLICATION-V1.1.pdf
Most of the clinical material in this document is based on the SOPs/Public Health England advice. Other useful re-
sources are given at the end of this document.
At Red Whale, we recognise that in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, things may be slightly different. However,
we do not have the resources to update this document 4 times each time something changes (which seems to be sev-
eral times a week at present!). We are very sorry!
The Scottish information is available here: https://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/a-to-z-of-topics/wuhan-novel-coronavirus/
Public Health Wales: https://phw.nhs.wales/topics/latest-information-on-novel-coronavirus-covid-19/
Northern Ireland information is here: https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/news/covid-19-coronavirus
What is the role of primary care in the current situation?
• Identify potential cases as soon as possible.
• Prevent potential transmission of infection to other patients, staff and the wider community.
• Offer appropriate care to those affected, whether this be at home or admission.
• Still do all the usual work of primary care that can’t be delayed!
NEW! What are the key changes?
I have flagged the key changes with NEW! so you can identify them without reading the whole document! The big
changes are:
• A ‘possible case’ (in the community) is someone with FEVER or NEW CONTINUOUS COUGH.
• The duration of self-isolation (now called ‘stay at home’) has changed.
• Those not ill enough to require admission will not be tested.
• Those over 70 or in vulnerable groups are asked to separate themselves from social contact as much as possible.
• There is now new guidance for care homes, which I have summarised briefly.
• What is the link between ibuprofen and COVID-19?
• What is the link between ACE inhibitors/ARBs and COVID-19?
What is COVID-19?
• COVID-19 is a new RNA virus from the coronavirus family that includes SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)
and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). It is thought to have started in a fish/animal market in China.
• The main method of transmission is respiratory droplets, or, in a healthcare setting, contact with bodily fluids.
• Treatment is supportive. It is not known if antivirals are effective. There is currently no vaccine.
The BMJ suggests (BMJ 202;368:m800):
• Median incubation 5–6 days (range 0–14).
• >80% have mild disease, 15% get severe disease including pneumonia, 5% become critically unwell.
• Mortality 2% overall (0.2% in those <50y, 15% in those >80y). Those with chronic diseases are also at higher risk.
NEW! When should you consider COVID-19?
IMPORTANT: THIS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY ON MONDAY 17 MARCH:
• The virus is assumed to be moving freely in the community so travel history or contact with an infected person
are not required to suspect COVID-19.
• Those being admitted will be tested. There is clear guidance on how to manage these patients (summarised be-
low).
• Those with ‘possible COVID-19’ (defined below) who are well enough to stay at home are asked to self-isolate
ALONG WITH THEIR WHOLE HOUSEHOLD and follow ‘stay at home’ guidance for a period of time (see section on
returning to normal activities for details of how long ’stay at home’ guidance should be followed for).
https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/20200305-COVID-19-PRIMARY-CARE-SOP-GP-PUBLICATION-V1.1.pdf
https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/20200305-COVID-19-PRIMARY-CARE-SOP-GP-PUBLICATION-V1.1.pdf
https://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/a-to-z-of-topics/wuhan-novel-coronavirus/
https://phw.nhs.wales/topics/latest-information-on-novel-coronavirus-covid-19/
https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/news/covid-19-coronavirus
Definition of ‘possible case’ in those well enough to remain in the community:
• New continuous cough.
• High temperature (not defined in primary care criteria, ≥37.8 in hospital definition).
(Remember: immunocompromised patients may present in atypical ways.)
‘Possible cases’ who remain in the community should be directed to the 111 online symptom checker which says
(PHE guidance):
• If they are very unwell, they should contact 111 on the phone and wait to speak to a nurse.
• If they are relatively well, they should follow the online ‘stay at home’ advice. They should not contact 111 by
phone unless they cannot manage their symptoms at home, their condition is deteriorating or their symptoms are
not getting better after 7 days. They should NOT go to a GP, pharmacy or hospital.
However, we know that some of these patients will contact us, and we will need to assess them – and there doesn’t
appear to be any Public Health England guidance on how we manage these individuals. Many of us are implementing
extensive telephone triage as a first-line strategy.
Health Protection Scotland suggests the following should be considered:
• Segregating patients with respiratory symptoms.
• Trying to see them in designated areas and at the end of lists.
• Using designated staff.
• PPE should be worn for any assessment of those with respiratory symptoms.
Definition of ‘possible case’ in those requiring admission:
Anyone requiring admission to hospital who has ANY of the following:
Influenza-like illness
OR
Clinical/radiological evidence of pneumonia
OR
Acute respiratory distress
Influenza-like illness is defined as T≥37.8C AND at least 1 of (acute onset) sore throat, hoarseness, sneezing, nasal
congestion/discharge, cough, wheeze, shortness of breath.
The guidance also reminds us that those who do not meet the COVID-19 criteria but have risk factors for avian flu or
MERS-CoV should be assessed/tested for these infections (we are thinking this is for hospital cases only).
• Avian flu criteria are here (briefly, require illness + close contact (within 1m) with live/dying/dead poultry in a part
of the world where avian flu is common in the past 10d (mainly Asia) https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/gov-
ernment/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/857436/Avian_flu_human_cases_guidance_Jan2020.pdf
• MERS-COV criteria are outlined here (but briefly, requires illness + middle east travel): https://assets.publish-
ing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/732267/Algorithm_case_v31-

NEW! Healthcare workers and staff: when should staff not work?
ANYONE (including NHS staff) with ‘possible COVID-19’ symptoms (fever or new persistent cough) OR with a house-
hold member with possible COVID-19 should follow ‘stay at home’ guidance (see section on returning to normal activ-
ities for details of how long ’stay at home’ guidance should be followed for).
NHS staff tend to suffer from presenteeism, rather than absenteeism, so make sure your staff know you really don’t
want to see them at work if they have any symptoms, and that knocking back a few paracetamol and soldiering on
is NOT acceptable and puts others at risk! Remember that for some, the financial implications of this mean they
may be reluctant to report symptoms – have you specifically decided on how you will handle sick pay during such
leave?

NEW! ‘Stay at home’ guidance for those with ‘possible COVID-19’
For those with ‘possible COVID-19’ who do not need admission, a test will not be offered, but they will be advised that
the whole household should follow
‘stay at home’ (see section on returning to normal activities for details of how
long ’stay at home’ guidance should be followed for)
111 does NOT need to be informed if a person is self-isolating in these situations.
What does ‘stay at home’ mean?
To protect others in the community
• Not leaving the house and, if living with others, minimising sharing space with others.
In an ideal world, this means:
• Sleeping alone.
• Not sharing a bed, toothbrush, crockery, towels or food.
• Staying in one room, into which others do not go, as much as possible. If rooms do need to be shared, using them
when others are not present.
• If possible, using a separate bathroom; if this is not possible, the patient cleans the bathroom after each use.
• If possible, having meals brought to the room rather than the patient preparing them in a shared space.
• Regular handwashing by all in the household, with the patient having a separate towel from the rest of the house-
hold.
Looking after self
• Identify those who can help provide supplies (dropping on the doorstep, not stopping to chat!), and keeping in
touch by phone/social media, not face to face.
• Can you exercise? If essential, yes, but keep a safe distance (at least 2m) from others.
• Can you go in the garden? Yes.
• Breastfeeding is safe (there is no evidence that COVID-19 is transmitted through breast milk).
• Pets are not at risk of getting coronavirus.
Detailed patient guidance is available here:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-people-
with-confirmed-or-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection
NEW! Returning to normal activity
This is complicated and slightly different advice is given on NHS and PHE sites. This is what we think they mean, and
clinically this makes sense!
The rationale, I think is this:
• Isolation of symptomatic people reduces spread.
• Isolating asymptomatic people who live with a symptomatic person stops the asymptomatic person spreading it
whilst incubating it, before they develop symptoms. This reduces spread to the community.
So the principles are:
• Those who develop symptoms must self-isolate for SEVEN days. After 7 days, if they are well, they can return to
normal activities. After coronavirus, people are likely to continue to cough for some weeks: they can return to nor-
mal even if they are still coughing.
• EVERYONE in the household of the index case needs to isolate for FOURTEEN days (to stop spread to the com-
munity). (Index case =
first person to get sick in the household).
o If during the 14d, a household member develops symptoms, they can return to normal activities SEVEN days
after the first day of their symptoms (provided when they are well) (even if they are still within the fourteen
days (they are no longer a risk to the community as they have had it and got better).
o Any member of the household who do NOT develop symptoms, can return to normal activities after FOUR-
TEENS days isolation FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THE INDEX CASE’S SYMPTOMS (you do not need to keep re-
starting the 14 day clock each time a person gets sick)

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-people-with-confirmed-or-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection
REMEMBER: after coronavirus, people are likely to continue to cough for some weeks: they can return to normal even
if they are still coughing.
For those who have tested positive for COVID-19/been admitted:
• They will be given specific advice on discharge.
NEW! Advice for vulnerable groups and over-70s
Who are we talking about?
High-risk groups Very high-risk groups (more announcements on this
group expected next week)
• Those who are pregnant.
• Those over 70, regardless of any medical conditions.
• Those adults under 70 who qualify for a flu jab,
which means:
o Long-term respiratory conditions.
o Chronic heart disease.
o Chronic kidney disease.
o Chronic liver disease.
o Chronic neurological conditions.
o Diabetes.
o After a splenectomy/sickle cell disease.
o Weakened immune system: HIV/AIDS, on ster-
oids, having chemo.
o Severe obesity (BMI ≥40).
• Post-transplant.
• Those with cancer having active chemo/radiother-
apy.
• Those with haematological cancers (at any stage of
treatment).
• Severe chest conditions (CF, asthmatics who require
admission/oral steroids).
• Severe diseases such as those needing dialysis.
What is suggested?
Social distancing: reducing interaction between people, which means:
• Avoiding contact with those who have symptoms.
• Avoiding non-essential use of public transport – if you have to use it, use it at less busy times.
• Working from home if possible.
• Avoiding large gatherings and gatherings in small public spaces (e.g. pubs, theatre, cinemas, restaurants).
• Avoiding gathering with friends and family – use technology to keep in touch.
• Contacting essential services (GP, etc.) by phone/online means.
• Looking after your physical and mental health, despite all of the above!
For those living with vulnerable groups:
If someone in the household a vulnerable person lives in gets COVID-19 symptoms, be particularly careful to follow
the guidance on self-isolation within the home to minimise contact between the ill person and the vulnerable person
as much as possible.
NEW! Care homes
Detailed information for various different care settings is available here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publica-
tions/covid-19-residential-care-supported-living-and-home-care-guidance
In brief, this suggests:
Ensuring all staff:
• Self-isolate if they develop any COVID-19-type symptoms (fever, new persistent cough).
• Wash hands regularly and use appropriate PPE if residents are symptomatic.
Visitors:
• Asking those with COVID-19 symptoms/those who are generally feeling unwell not to visit.
• Ensuring good hand hygiene for all visitors.
Patients:
• Nursing in a single room with en suite if possible.
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-residential-care-supported-living-and-home-care-guidance
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-residential-care-supported-living-and-home-care-guidance
There is also guidance on how to manage waste and linen from infected patients in the document listed above.
Put measures in place to stop patients with COVID-19 coming to the surgery/prepare for if they do
Put all necessary measures in place to prevent a patient turning up at the surgery.
• Make sure patients are aware that they should not come to the surgery by putting messages on your website,
sending text messages, and getting receptionists to screen patients when they ring for an appointment/home
visit.
The key message is:
If you suspect you have any coronavirus symptoms (fever or new persistent cough):
• Use the 111 online coronavirus service to find out what to do next (it’s a few simple questions and then tells you
what to do). Only call 111 if you are significantly unwell and can not cope with your symptoms at home.
• Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.
In Scotland, call your GP or NHS 24 on 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, call 0300 200 7885.
NEW! If a patient contacts the surgery and thinks they may have COVID-19/fever/new cough
If a patient with FEVER or NEW, PERISTENT COUGH contacts primary care:
• If they are CRITICALLY UNWELL: call an ambulance. Tell the call handler this is a ‘possible COVID-19’ case.
• If not critically unwell, they should be referred to the 111 online app or 111 service. The 111 online symptom
checker says:
o If they are very unwell, they should contact 111 on the phone and wait to speak to a nurse.
o If they are relatively well, they should follow ‘stay at home’ advice and NOT go to a GP, pharmacy or hospital.
There is no clear guidance on what primary care does if, after contacting 111, a patient wants advice from primary
care. Clearly, if we are telephone triaging these patients, we will be making a judgement call as to whether COVID-19
is the best explanation, or whether, as is inevitable, there may be other explanations, e.g. croup, bronchiolitis, that
may need a different management strategy.
Health Protection Scotland suggests the following should be considered:
• Segregating patients with respiratory symptoms.
• Trying to see them in designated areas and at the end of lists.
• PPE should be worn for any assessment of those with respiratory symptoms/influenza-like illness.
How to communicate this to patients: suggested patient information for your telephone system and for texts, online
booking service and practice website is available in appendix 1 of this document: https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-
content/uploads/2020/02/20200305-COVID-19-PRIMARY-CARE-SOP-GP-PUBLICATION-V1.1.pdf
Who needs what PPE?
• Clinical staff need disposable aprons, gloves and fluid-resistant surgical masks (gowns and eye protection needed
if doing an aerosol-generating procedure: in primary care, this means CPR and manual ventilation, but nebuliser
use is NOT on the list).
• Cleaners need disposable gloves and aprons.
• Reception staff do NOT need PPE.
All staff should know how to put on and remove PPE, and how to dispose of it, and must do this before leaving the
contaminated area (in our surgery, we have put a PPE removal guide on the back of each door).
Instructions on how to put on and remove PPE are available here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wu-
han-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control.
• If PPE is used on a home visit, it must be removed at the house and then DOUBLE bagged while being transported
back to the surgery for disposal.
Be prepared for a scenario where patients turn up unexpectedly
• Identify a room to act as an isolation room (a room that could be decommissioned for a period before it was ap-
propriately decontaminated, with a phone, near a toilet that could also be put out of action until decontami-
nated?).

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control
• Declutter it now so that non-essential furnishings and items are removed to aid decontamination after an event.
Keep the phone in the room – you may need this to communicate with the patient!
• Place a card in the room so that patients who are left alone in it will know what is to happen next.
• Prepare a 'support pack' for this room – bottled water, disposable tissues, clinical waste disposal facility, fluid-re-
sistant surgical mask.
If you identify a patient in the surgery who may have COVID-19
This section is based on PHE and NHSE guidance for primary care/standard operating procedures, written at a time
when ‘suspected COVID-19’ was defined as clinical features + travel/contact history. The definitions have now
changed, and we talk about ‘possible COVID-19’. It is not clear how much of this still applies BUT, at the time of writ-
ing (17/3/20), these documents are all still live. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wn-cov-guidance-for-
primary-care/wn-cov-interim-guidance-for-primary-care
At present, none of these scenarios should occur: but what if they do?
To reduce the risk of these scenarios happening: make sure you are screening patients before they arrive/before a
home visit is agreed.
Patient presents at reception
with suspected coronavirus
Consultation started,
then coronavirus becomes a possibility
• Advise to go home immediately and use the 111
symptom checker and advice.
• If too unwell/unwilling to leave surgery: isolate
them (+ any relatives and any clinical waste) im-
mediately.
• Leave the room, closing the door behind you.
• Wash your hands thoroughly.
• Complete the consultation via telephone.
• Avoid physical examination of a suspected case.
• If the patient is relatively well, then you may decide to send them home (you can complete the assessment
over the phone) (the guidance says ring 111, but that is now out of date advise!)
• While the patient remains at the surgery:
o Ensure no one enters the room.
o Keep in regular contact with the patient while they are at the surgery, either on the phone or by talking to
them through the closed door.
o Do NOT enter the room unless the patient is very unwell, and then only if wearing appropriate PPE.
• If the patient needs to use the lavatory:
o Inform them to go to the lavatory and return to their room immediately afterwards.
o They should be told to wash their hands thoroughly afterwards.
o The lavatory should then not be used by anyone else until thoroughly cleaned (following advice on decon-
tamination from the relevant authorities).
• If it is essential to enter a room where a patient is being isolated (i.e. the patient is very unwell):
o Wear PPE in line with standard infection control precautions, such as gloves, apron and fluid-resistant surgi-
cal mask. Afterwards, dispose of PPE as clinical waste.
o Keep exposure to a minimum.
o Once the patient has left the building, DO NOT ENTER/USE the isolation room/lavatory until it has been
appropriately decontaminated.
Patient presenting with suspected coronavirus
during a home visit
• Take the patient’s telephone number, leave the room, close the door and wash your hands thoroughly.
• The guidance says ask the patient /career to ring 111 but this is based on out of date guidance. I think most of
us would try to complete the assessment from outside the room/on the phone/put PPE on .
If the patient needs immediate aid, apply appropriate PPE. On removal, this should be DOUBLE bagged for transit
(so visiting staff need PPE + TWO clinical waste bags).
• If the patient is in a care home: contact 111 AND inform the local health protection team to discuss possible
contact tracing, decontamination and further follow-up.
If the patient requires urgent transfer to hospital
• Inform the ambulance service call handlers that it is ‘possible coronavirus’.
• All potential admissions MUST be discussed with the hospital first, to ensure they are appropriately prepared.

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wn-cov-guidance-for-primary-care/wn-cov-interim-guidance-for-primary-care
How to arrange laboratory testing
Testing is not routinely offered unless patients are ill enough to need admission. Results are taking up to 72 hours to
come back.
If you are asked about which tests are needed, see here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/up-
loads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/866111/COVID-19_Suspected_cases_sam-
ples_taken_A3_poster_AandE_09.pdf
Decontamination of primary care facilities
This section is based on PHE and NHSE guidance for primary care/standard operating procedures, written at a time
when ‘suspected COVID-19’ was defined as clinical features + travel/contact history. The definitions have now
changed, and we talk about ‘possible COVID-19. It is not clear how much of this still applies BUT, at the time of writing,
(17/3/20) these documents are all still live.
Practices are responsible for the supply of clinical materials and PPE for staff, and ensuring they know how to use
them. Cleaners should wear disposable gloves and an apron.
Practices may need to close temporarily for cleaning of community areas: follow usual business continuity arrange-
ments. However, the aim is that practices should remain OPEN unless advised to close by the health protection team.
• The room itself: once the patient has been transferred to the appropriate setting:
o Shut the door, open the windows and switch the air conditioning OFF.
o The room then needs to be decontaminated.
o After decontamination, the room can be put back into immediate use.
• Communal areas (waiting room, toilet):
o Any blood/body fluids should be cleaned up immediately.
o Clean the areas with detergent and disinfectant as soon as practically possible; once done, the room can be
put back into immediate use.
All waste should be removed from the room and quarantined until the patient test results are known; if the patient is
confirmed as having COVID-19, take advice from the local health protection team on what to do next. Your local
health protection team can be found at: at www.gov.uk/health-protection-team.
Follow section 4 of this document for the nitty gritty of how to do it:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publica-
tions/wn-cov-guidance-for-primary-care/wn-cov-interim-guidance-for-primary-care
Contact tracing
This will the responsibility of the public health teams.
The idea is to identify all those who the patient has come into contact with, assess the risk to those individuals and
contact/offer advice/test if appropriate.
For more information, see this PHE blog:
https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/13/expert-interview-what-is-contact-tracing/
UPDATED! Ibuprofen/NSAIDs and COVID-19
What is the latest? The current advice (letter from Prof Stephen Powls, Medical Director NHSE) says:
• Unpublished data from France, which the UK authorities have not seen, has led to the French Health minister ad-
vising against the use of ibuprofen.
• There is no current published evidence that NSAIDs have an impact on COVID-19.
However, the NICE/Committee of Human Medicines (an advisory body of the MHRA) have been asked to review the
evidence.
• In the meantime, those with/suspected to have COVID-19 should use paracetamol in preference to NSAIDs.
• Those on NSAIDs for other medical reasons (e.g. arthritis) should not stop them.
NEW! What about ACE inhibitors/ARBs and COVID-19?

Those with comorbidities (including hypertension) are at increased risk of death from COVID-19 infections. There has
been some speculation that ACE inhibitors/ARBs may further increase the risk of serious illness/death from COVID-19.
The European Society of Cardiology (and many other bodies around the world) has been quick to use a statement dis-
missing this (https://www.escardio.org/Councils/Council-on-Hypertension-(CHT)/News/position-statement-of-the-
esc-council-on-hypertension-on-ace-inhibitors-and-ang):
“Speculation about the safety of ACE-inhibitors or ARB treatment in relation to COVID-19 does not have a sound scien-
tific basis or evidence to support it. Indeed, there is evidence from studies in animals suggesting that these medications
might be rather protective against serious lung complications in patients with COVID-19 infection, but to date there is
no data in humans.
The Council on Hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology wish to highlight the lack of any evidence support-
ing harmful effect of ACE-I and ARB in the context of the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak.
The Council on Hypertension strongly recommend that physicians and patients should continue treatment with their
usual anti-hypertensive therapy because there is no clinical or scientific evidence to suggest that treatment with ACEi
or ARBs should be discontinued because of the COVID-19 infection.”
If you see people on ACE inhibitors/ARBs, remember to reassure them about this and check they are still taking
their tablets!

About Us
About Us
We’ve grown from humble roots and we’re still firmly planted there!
Who We Are
What we value
Social Enterprise
Contact Us
In 2007 two practising GPs had a dream of helping themselves and their colleagues by taking CPD from a tick box exercise to a practical tool that could really help day to day practice. They talked to a frustrated accountant who wanted to make a difference in the world. The three clinked their mugs over the kitchen table and ‘GP Update’ was born.
12 years later, a new name, 50 team members and over 15,000 primary care clinicians trained each year, Red Whale still has its roots firmly around that kitchen table. The desire to be a force for good and the ethos that drove the trio to launch is still at the heart of our business today.
Our mission is to provide you with the best quality medical education in the UK (and abroad through our Social Enterprise PCI) – creating content that you can put into practice straight away, making your life a little bit easier and enabling you to provide your patients with the best care possible.
We try to offer products that respond to the different learning styles of all primary care clinicians, at different stages in their career; from our beloved handbooks to our flagship one day face to face update courses, to online courses, award winning webinars and online resources you can access 24/7.
And whilst we can’t promise to make the long days shorter, the dark days lighter or your appointment list any less crowded, we CAN promise that we will do some of the hard work for you, cutting through the clutter and producing relevant content and tools to help you deal with the challenges you face every day and save you time and energy.
The quality of our education is our guiding principle. We are far from perfect, but we will never knowingly let our standards drop. If we accidentally make a mistake (and we do make a few), we will tell you and apologise.
We hold our customers, colleagues, suppliers and environmental concerns at the forefront of every decision we make. We strive to do better by each and every one of our stakeholders, even when it costs us more to do so.
While all that might sound a bit serious, we never take ourselves too seriously, incorporating a good dose of humour in everything we do.
Oh, and you’ve probably heard us mention this before, but we will never ever EVER take pharmaceutical company sponsorship of any kind, no exhibitors, no pharma sponsored mail shots, not even a biscuit a pen or a sticky note! And we’re shamelessly proud of it!
In 2013, five years after Red Whale was born, the founders got together around the same kitchen table with another group of people passionate about enabling the best possible care through education in resource poor settings but frustrated by the barriers that prevented this.
Globally there has long been under-investment in primary care. Every year, 41 million people die from NCDs, mostly in low and middle income countries. Primary care, in the community, is the place where NCDs are usually best addressed, in terms of early diagnosis and early intervention. Health workers need training and support to offer consistent quality care in the community. The systems around them also need to change. In response to these challenges, Primary Care International was born.
Red Whale became a founding partner for the organisation and to this day, still supports PCI in its mission to support primary healthcare systems and health workers and to tackle the growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) around the world.
Since its start, PCI has worked with a wide range of partners and clients, from major public health organisations like the World Health Organisation (WHO), to international non-governmental organisations to smaller agencies testing innovative approaches and pioneering new approaches to family medicine across the world.
PCI has trained clinicians in numerous countries across Africa, Asia and the Middle East, in some of the harshest and poorest conditions that exist. They have also developed NCD guidelines for the care of refugees globally, using only WHO essential medicines. We donate our intellectual property to PCI so they can deliver Red Whale-style courses and online learning to healthcare providers outside of the UK. Profits from this work go to support our work in low and middle-income countries.
To read more about PCI’s work, to commission Red Whale services overseas, or to get involved in our projects, please visit https://pci-360.com/.
If you’d like to find out about PCI's GP Update 5-Day Global Programme for family medicine doctors practising outside of the UK, please click here.
We are a small, friendly team, and we always welcome constructive feedback and suggestions, or an opportunity to talk with you. Our office hours are Monday to Friday 9.00am to 5.00pm.

Privacy Notice
Privacy Notice
Last updated 10 December 2018
Introduction
GP Update Limited (trading as Red Whale) takes your privacy very seriously.
We ask you to read this Privacy Policy carefully as it contains important information about what to expect when we collect information about you and how we will use your personal data.
Why do we need your information?
We use personal data to do three things:
1. Perform our contractual duty towards you or fulfil a request you have made to us, ie. Ship a handbook order, get you booked on one of our courses, track your CPD credits, provide you a quote for a private course etc.
2. Keep you informed about clinical or operational matters applicable to General Practice and the products we offer.
3. Perform our legal obligations as a company eg. Pay HMRC.
Whose data do we collect?
We hold data on anyone who has attended a course or bought or commissioned a product or service from us (including subscribing to our online content).
We also hold data of those who we think might be interested in our products and services.
How we obtain your data
The majority of the information we hold about you has been provided directly to us by you:
(i) on forms on our websites,
(ii) in response to marketing or other communications,
(iii) through social media,
(iv) by signing up for a course, product or service,
(v) through participation in an offer, program or promotion,
(vi) in connection with an actual or potential business or employment relationship with us.
In some cases we may collect data from someone else.
For example, you may have instructed a colleague to book you on a course or you may have chosen to consent to third parties disclosing information about you to us that those third parties have collected.
We may collect data from publicly available sources. Examples include information gathered from a news article or on-line media, including social media like LinkedIn or Twitter. We may also use publicly available directories and similar information such as Companies’ House.
What we do with your data and why
If you are a delegate, customer or business contact
The core purpose of our data processing is to ensure you receive the products and services you expect from us.
In order to fulfil this, we will use the data we collect about you to perform our obligations to you under the contract we have signed, or to provide you with the information you have requested.
This includes letting you know about the date and location of the course you are booked on and any after course email to explain how to use the online access you have received.
We will also use this information to send you communications about clinical updates and product information we publish via e-mail or post.
We may use data obtained other than from you to ensure that your contact details are up to date.
We collect the following classes of information:
Contact information (Title, Name and address, email)
Business contact information (such as job title, department and name and address of organisation/surgery, professional registration numbers eg. GMC, NMC etc.)
Mobile number – only used to let you know about a last-minute change to your booking
Information about our relationship with you, correspondence, meeting notes, booking and attendance at courses, details of your subscription to our products etc.
CPD information you enter on our website in order to fulfil any requirement for revalidation.
Contact information for colleagues or other delegates you might book on our courses.
Other information you provide (such as any information that you provide when you contact us about a booking).
Content you make available through social media accounts or memberships with third parties.
Geo-location data.
Consent to track
When you tick the box to consent to your email activity being tracked you are giving your consent for us to look at; which emails you have opened, which links you have clicked, which emails you have shared and your geographical location. Having access to this data will enable us to send you more relevant communications.
If you are a clinician or manager in the UK or Ireland and you have never purchased from us
The core purpose of our data processing is to inform you about the products and services we offer via e-mail or post.
We may use data obtained other than from you to ensure that your contact details are up to date.
We collect the following classes of information:
Title, Name and address of office or surgery, email address
We also utilise a third party, Google, to track the usage and volume of users on our website. The information it collects is not in any way associated with the details we hold about you online.
How we look after your information
We keep your data secure in our database with appropriate security mechanisms in place.
We do not share your data with anyone else or any other organisation unless it is necessary for the purpose for which you have given us the data or required by law. Examples are given below:
We may share basic information on the attendees at a course with the venue and/or event organiser.
We may pass data to other organisations, known as Data Processors, to provide specific services to us. An example would be providing data to a mailing house in order to send a newsletter. A contract is always in place with a Data Processor, and they are not allowed to do anything with your data other than what we have requested.
We require these service providers by contract to safeguard the privacy and security of personal information they process on our behalf.
Our responsibilities
The law requires us to tell you the basis on which we process your data.
Some activities (for example sending you emails which promote our courses and products and those of our partners) require your consent. If the law requires your consent to process data in a certain way then we will obtain it before carrying out that activity.
Other activities are carried out to fulfil a contract or agreement. Examples include sending you a confirmation email after booking on a course or ordering a handbook. Each requires us to know who you are and to process your information in order to do the thing you have asked us to do. If a contract is in place then we will process your data based on that contract.
In all other cases the law allows us to process your data if it is in our legitimate interest to do so, but only so long as we need to and your “interests or your fundamental rights and freedoms are not overriding”. We may send you postal mailings under this basis.
We will keep data for as long as is needed to complete the task for which it was collected. Relationships between Red Whale and delegates may be long term, and so we expect to keep your data for as long as that relationship exists, or until we no longer need it.
Your rights
You have a variety of rights about the way we process your data. These are as follows:
Where our use of your data requires consent, you may withdraw this consent at any time. You can do so by clicking the unsubscribe button at the bottom of every email we send you.
Where we rely on our legitimate interest to process data, you may ask us to stop doing so by contacting us at mail@red-whale.co.uk.
You may request a copy of the data we hold about you.
You may ask us to change or stop the way in which we communicate with you or process data about you, and if it is not required for the purpose you provided it, then we will do so. Activities such as fulfilling our contractual obligations to you, may mean we cannot entirely stop processing your data.
However, we will always endeavour to comply with such a request.
If we fail to address an issue or complaint within the time applicable by law, you have the right to contact the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) on https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/ or their helpline on telephone: 0303 123 1113
Contacting us
If you have any questions about this privacy notice, about the way in which we process your data, or if you wish to change the way we use your data, including how we communicate with you, then please contact us:

COVID-19
An emotional and psychological survival guide
We are living through unprecedented times. The rapid spread of the coronavirus is affecting us all mentally, if not physically. Despite crazy times like these (or perhaps because of times like these), it's even more important that we look after our own mental health.
Doctors and healthcare staff are at the frontline. As well as coping with the anxiety that is felt by the general population, we are coping with the uncertainty of what the next few days are going to bring us at work; concerns about how we are going to look after our most vulnerable patients; and the prospect of our colleagues becoming ill too.
But healthcare workers are remarkably resilient. We know how to do a great job under pressure, and we have an amazing ability to pull it out of the bag in times of extreme workload and stress. To be able to continue to do this, we need to stay as mentally healthy as possible. Read this PEARL and watch the special edition of the You Are Not A Frog podcast (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2LQEpJPfcM&feature=youtu.be) to hear Rachel Morris (YANAF podcast host and one of our Lead. Manage. Thrive! course authors and presenters) and Caroline Walker (a Psychiatrist and The Joyful Doctor) talk about how doctors can manage their own stress and anxiety throughout this crisis.
We'd love to hear your suggestions about other resources that would help supports you in doing the best job you can.
Remember, you are not superhuman, you can only do your best....and you are awesome. Thank you.

Regarding the risk of primary care symptoms for all urological cancers, the only high-risk feature in primary care is visible haematuria.

Are there any high-risk features that should alert us to consider bladder or renal cancer?
Regarding the risk of primary care symptoms for all urological cancers, the only high-risk feature in primary care is visible haematuria.
Having said this, not all patients with bladder or renal cancer experience visible haematuria. So, how do we determine who we should refer for further investigation? And when might non-visible haematuria be significant?
We will look closely at issues around prostate cancer in next week’s webinar being run in association with Macmillan Cancer Support. But meanwhile, as a urological cancer taster…..
There are 10,000 new cases of bladder cancer (the incidence is decreasing) and nearly 13,000 new cases of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma) per year in the UK. Around 50% of people survive these cancers for 10 or more years.
It is estimated that about one-third of cases of bladder and renal cancer are preventable. The major risk factors for bladder and kidney cancers include:
Smoking.
Overweight and obesity.
Occupational exposure to industrial chemicals, e.g. aromatic amines found in the dye, textile, pesticide and rubber industries (bladder cancer only).
Family history of an affected first-degree relative.
Radiation exposure, e.g. pelvic irradiation for other cancers.
Schistosomiasis for bladder cancer (rare in UK population).
Regarding the risk of primary care symptoms for all urological cancers, the only high-risk feature in primary care was visible haematuria, with a PPV of 5.1% in a BJGP study.
Having said this, not all patients with bladder or renal cancer experience visible haematuria, so, if investigations are restricted to this group alone, some diagnoses will inevitably be delayed. The low PPV of other symptoms, even in clusters, makes selecting other groups for urgent investigation difficult.
For non-visible haematuria in those over 60y, the PPV is >3 only if also presenting with dysuria or with a raised WBC count.
Antiplatelets and anticoagulants may contribute to haematuria, but for those with non-visible haematuria on these medications, 10% will have pathology (this is in line with the background population). So, we should not attribute haematuria to these drugs without investigating.
Women experience more delays in diagnosis of bladder cancer than men.
Remember, bladder cancer is an industrial disease for a small proportion of patients, and they may be entitled to compensation.
Also remember to store test sticks in the correct container with the lid closed – prolonged exposure to air or damp may give a false positive result. Check the guidance for the brand you use in your surgery, and check expiry dates!

What do we need to consider when we are asked for a prescription to postpone periods?
Partial metabolism of norethisterone to ethinyloestadiol means that we should be thinking carefully when asked to prescribe norethisterone in order to postpone periods. What is the risk, and what are the main contraindications?
Given the sheer array of problems women can have with their periods (which we will be covering in detail in our Deep Dive webinar), it isn’t surprising that sometimes we get requests to postpone menstruation. These requests may relate to holiday plans or be for other reasons.
Discussions about the length of the holiday and prescribing the appropriate quantity of norethisterone take a short amount of time.
We might even prescribe on request without such a discussion. But should we be thinking this through more carefully?
MHRA guidance highlights important contraindications. Partial metabolism to ethinyloestadiol means that, at therapeutic doses, we need to be thinking about VTE risk and assessing this as we would for combined hormonal preparations.

Tight foreskins – what can we do short of circumcision?
Phimosis may be simply physiological and cause no problems. It may be secondary to an underlying skin disease. So, what do we need to look for, and what are the treatment options?
Phimosis may be physiological. It may be primary. It may be secondary to an underlying skin disorder. Whichever of these, and whether child or adult, your patient is likely to feel embarrassed about discussing the problem and awkward about physical examination.
If asymptomatic, it requires no treatment. But if it does require treatment, what should we offer? When might topical corticosteroids be appropriate and when should we refer?

You request a CTKUB. By the time you get the result, the patient has already rung to tell you that have ""passed the little blighter"", and indeed the scan showed a single small stone that was likely to come out on its own. However, that wasn't the only thing on the scan result: it reports a small lesion in the right adrenal gland, but unfortunately doesn't give you any advice on what to do next! So what do you do?
All adrenal incidentlomas need referring to endocrinology but take a history first: features such as hypertension, flushes or Cushingoid appearance that are pertinent to the referral may affect how quickly the patient is seen.
Most (85%) are benign and produce no hormones.

There are several options for the treatment of actinic keratosis, including topical and physical treatments, depending on the grading and location of the lesions. But what is the best treatment?
A 2019 NEJM article looked at the effectiveness of four treatments that are field-directed: 5% fluorouracil cream, 5% imiquimod cream, photodynamic therapy and 0.015% ingenol mebutate gel.
5% fluorouracil cream was shown to be the best – and is the cheapest!
Is fluorouracil the first-line agent in your area?
Note that in January 2020, the marketing authorisation for ingenol was suspended due to risk of skin malignancy. We are asked to stop prescribing ingenol and consider other treatment options, as appropriate. We are also asked to advise patients to be vigilant for any skin lesions developing within the treatment area, and to seek medical advice promptly should any occur.

How confident do you feel when it comes to treating gout?
When we are now encouraged to start disease-modifying treatment following a first attack of gout, how can we be confident enough in our diagnosis to recommend urate-lowering treatment?
You might be confident based on your clinical judgement to start a course of treatment for an attack of gout, but are you confident enough to be recommending disease-modifying treatment with a first attack? When might diagnostic tests be indicated, and, importantly, does primary care scoring system that does not require aspiration perform better than clinical judgement alone?
Pete, age 58y, limps into your consulting room. “My big toe is killing me”, he says. “The same thing happened about a year ago but it went away with taking ibuprofen for a few days. Now I think this might be gout.”
Pete has hypertension which is controlled with ramipril. His right first MTP joint is red, swollen, warm and painful to move.
You feel confident, based on clinical assessment, to manage this episode as an attack of gout, but recall reading that we should start urate-lowering treatment after a first attack of gout. Are you confident enough to recommend disease-modifying treatment for Pete?
And what if you were less certain about the diagnosis, for example if it were his ankle affected rather than MTP joint? When do you need to consider diagnostic tests? Should you be considering joint aspiration?
For a typical attack, clinical features have a high likelihood ratio of being correct. However, a scoring system can improve accuracy of diagnosis. Pete will want to know that you are confident about your diagnosis if you are suggesting that he needs disease-modifying treatment. There is a primary care scoring system that does not require aspiration and that performs better than clinical judgement alone.

A study looking at patients over the age of 65y with a history of recurrent UTI found that use of prophylactic antibiotics reduced the risk of recurrent UTI by 51% in women and 43% in men. But there is more to this story!
A study looking at patients over the age of 65y with a history of recurrent UTI found that use of prophylactic antibiotics reduced the risk of recurrent UTI by 51% in women and 43% in men. This had a corresponding effect of a 22% reduction in UTI-related hospital admission in men, but this was not seen in women.
Of those who did get antibiotics, more than 50% took them for over 2 years!
This study did not look at antibiotic-related adverse events or at rates of resistant bacteria in urine, and the data is reliant on accurate read-coding of UTI diagnoses in primary care, so we cannot comment on the possible harms of prophylactic antibiotics for recurrent UTI in the elderly from these results.
So, food for thought when you next discuss recurrent UTIs with an older person, or do theo=ir medication review and see they have been on the antibiotic for 2 years!

Understanding the different roles in the ARRS
Like it or loathe it, the PCN seems here to stay, though whether primary care stays with DES is a different matter altogether!
One of the opportunities of the DES is the potential to integrate new roles into primary care to help solve some of the key challenges that many of us are facing, particularly shortage of GPs and increasing patient demand. This is also known as the Additional Role Reimbursement Scheme or ARRS.
Regardless of the outcome of the DES specification consultation and our individual practice choices about whether to participate, multidisciplinary primary care may be a good pragmatic option for many of our teams.
But this represents a big change and, like all change, if managed badly, it will cause more stress, disillusionment and wasted time. So, we need some pointers to make it work.
We are offering some resources and support to make this as easy as possible for you. You will find here one of a series of articles designed to help you navigate the complexities of this process of employing and utilising new professional groups within your team.
Done well, it may actually be the best thing to happen to primary care in years. So, what is the ARRS and how might it help us?

What should we advise for children with diarrhoea and vomiting?
NICE advises us to offer oral rehydration solution to those 'at increased risk' of dehydration. But is oral hydration solution better than fruit juice for children with diarrhoea and vomiting?
""I've tried to get Jimmy to drink the oral rehydration solution, but he spits it out. I tasted it and I don't blame it - it tastes awful!""
NICE advises us to offer oral rehydration solution to those 'at increased risk' of dehydration.
A Canadian study looked at whether oral rehydration solution is better than fruit juice for children with diarrhoea and vomiting. The group treated with dilute aplle juice was less likely to end up needing IV fluids than the group treated with oral rehydration solution!
However, 68% of the children in the trial showed no signs of dehydration, and the rest of the group showed only mild dehydration.
So, what can we tell from this?
We can stop using oral rehydration solution 'just in case' in non-dehydrated children with gastroenteritis.
There had previously been concerns that the high sugar content in fruit juice might increase diarrhoea, but this was not shown in this study.
For children with any clinical signs of moderate dehydration, oral rehydration solution may still be the most appropriate option PROVIDING the child will drink it!

What should you consider when your patient says, “I’m still coughing”?
You've done a chest X-ray, treated them for reflux, given them a nasal spray to treat any post-nasal dip, and they are still coughing. What next?
First, get the patient to demonstrate their 'cough' as it might not be a cough after all!
Asthma, reflux and ACE inhibitors are the most common culprits.
Pay careful attention to red flags (in particular dyspnoea, haemoptysis, hoarseness, weight loss, fever, dysphagia and chest pain).
And don't forget to consider non-respiratory as well as respiratory causes.
The list of causes to consider is long but you don't have to remember it - just 'Red Whale it' when you need the info by looking for Cough: chronic article.

Winter’s back and so are patients presenting with sinusitis. So how can we change our practice on this? Read our article here: And join us for our webinar - Top 10 practice-changing points of 2019 – to hear about this and much more! Register here
Sinusitis is part of the ‘bread and butter’ of primary care. Is there anything new? Anything that will radically change your practice? Yes, there is!
The 2017 NICE guidelines suggest:
Sinusitis is a self-limiting illness in most and usually lasts about 2–3w. Nothing new here!
Antibiotics make very little difference to duration of symptoms, probably because less than 2% of cases are complicated by bacterial infection. Again, nothing new here.
If you have to use antibiotics, and this will be a big change in practice, use phenoxymethylpenicillin for 5d because it is narrower spectrum than amoxicillin.
This change is one of our top 10 tips for 2019.

How do you handle a possible upper GI bleed?
Your patient admits drinking too much and presents with epigastric pain. He also tells you he recently took ibuprofen for a painful shoulder. Could it be an acute upper GI bleed? What do you do next?
""I never look at my poo, I just flush it away"", says Tony in response to your question trying to ascertain whether he has melaena. Tony is a 46-year-old who admits drinking more than he should and presents with epigastric pain. He took some ibuprofen last week for a painful shoulder. So, has Tony had an acute GI bleed?
Acute upper GI bleeding is common and serious, with 10% mortality. Peptic ulcer is the most common cause, followed by gastritis/duodenitis.
In the acute phase, a normal haemoglobin and normal blood pressure do not rule out a substantial bleed so we should not be reassured if these are normal. A raised pulse rate is more sensitive.
The bottom line is, we should refer all patients with a good history.
So, what are you going to do with Tony?
And what about management after an acute upper GI bleed? Can your patient ever again use NSAIDS? And what if they were on antiplatelets or anticoagulation?

Our understanding of the neurobiology of pain has completely revolutionised over the last few years. And because of that, lots of alternative management strategies for persistent pain have also emerged.
Read more below about managing chronic pain and for even more resources, watch our FREE chronic pain webinar!
A cry we are hearing a lot on our GP Update and MSK courses at the moment is, ""We can't use opiates, we can't use gabapentinoids, what can we use for patients with chronic pain?"".
Unfortunately, there is not a quick-fix, easy answer: no single tablet that will cure chronic pain. But there is a lot we can do. Our understanding of the neurobiology of chronic pain has changed beyond recognition since many of us were at medical school. In our next VA webinar, we will unpack this and start to talk about consultation strategies, specific self-mangement skills and great resources.
The International Association for the Study of Pain (ASP) defines pain as: an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.
This definition contains several important elements:
Pain is an experience, i.e it is subjective.
Pain is both a sensation and has an emotional aspect.
Tissue damage is not necessary for pain to exist.
The patient's description of their pain may be the same whether or not the tissue damage is present.
Nocicption is the neural process of encoding noxious stimuli. It is triggered when noxious stimuli act on specialised peripheral nerve endings.
However:
It does not necessarily result in the individual perceiving pain.
It is also possible for an individual to perceive pain when there is nociception. This occurs in some chronic pain states.
Most clinicians and lay people continue to view pain according to the biomedical model. We in primary care treat teh physical, psychological and social problems of our patients on a daily basis, and use the biopsychosocial model routinely for medical problems such as depression or anxiety. A biopsychosocial approach to patients with chronic pain is essential in understanding and treating their pain effectively.

How does varicoceles affect male infertility?
Varicoceles happen in 15% of adolescent boys & men. Two thirds have no fertility problems, but for others it's linked to reduced sperm quality. What do you when a patient is experiencing infertility or worried about it?
You have reassured Charlie that the swelling he felt in his scrotum is just a varicocele and is not cancer. However, he still looks anxious and asks, ""will this mean I cannot have a child?"".
Varicoceles are common, occurring in 15% of adolescent boys and men. Two-thirds of men with a varicocele do not have problems with fertility, though varicoceles do increase scrotal temperature, reduce testicular perfusion, and are associated with reduced sperm quality in observational studies.
Embolisation of large varicoceles may improve sperm quality. However, NICE concludes that varicocele surgery should not be offered as fertility treatment because it does not improve pregnancy rates.
Infertility is the failure to conceive after >1y of reguar unprotected sex. One in seven couples in teh UK access infertility treatent. Abnominal semen analysis occurs in nearly half of couples with infertility.
Male infertility can be caused by hormonal, testicular or obstructive factors, or may be functional. No cause is identified in a third of cases. Where possible identification of the underlying cause can help guide advice, investigation and referral.
If semen analysis is abnormal, we should repeat the sample and advise regarding reversible causes of semen abnormalities, assess for the underlying cause of male infertility, arrange bloods and if clinically appropriate an ultrasoud scan. We can then refer to fertility services along with referral to endocrinology/urology, as required.

How do we manage lung cancer in primary care?
UK lung cancer survival rates lag a long way behind some of Europe and we need to make earlier diagnoses. How can we change our practice?
We've teamed up with Macmillan to bring you this Pearl and free webinar on Lung Cancer.
We can make earlier diagnosis in primary care by:
Improving patients awareness of symptoms - 'Be Clear on Cancer' has done this.
Having a low threshold for referring for CXR in at-risk patients - CXRs are cheap, widely available and relatively harm-free!
Not being falsely reassured by negative CXR in patients with persistent symptoms.
Remember, beware the negative CXR - if we still have a degree of suspicion, we should refer!
So, when should we order a chest radiograph?
Lung cancer does not always present with a clear symptom signature, and affected individuals often have comorbidities that could confuse the picture. While haemoptysis is the most predictive isolated symptom, it only occurs in 20% of those with a final diagnosis of lung cancer. Remember more unusual presentations such as thrombocytosis, appetite loss, shoulder pain and worsening spirometry, especially in smokers. NICE offers clear guidance on how we should approach patients presenting with symptoms that could be suggestive of lung cancer.
And remember too that stopping smoking is beneficial at any stage, even after a diagnosis of lung cancer.
Click on the PDF button to see our summary of NICE guidance and recent BMJ and BJGP articles on the diagnosis of lung cancer.
Yes, our headline about UK survival rates from lung cancer sounds depressing. But there is hope in the form of screening for earlier detection and evolving innovative immunotherapy-based treatments. Our key challenges in primary care are prevention through smoking cessation, helping patients spot it early and supporting patients through ever-more-complex regimens.

Subclinical hypothyroidism – overdiagnosis or worth treating?
It’s a dilemma in patients with a raised TSH and normal T4: a small % develop overt hypothyroidism, but many will see their TSH levels normalise over 2 years. What should we do?
We have several dilemmas when we encounter a raised TSH with normal T4. Each year, a small percentage of these patients will develop overt hypothyroidism. But with a single raised TSH of less than 7mIU/L, there is a 50% chance of the level normalising over 2 years.
What about CHD risk? A meta-analysis has shown that, overall, there was no difference in CHD incidence, CHD mortality or overall mortality between those with subclinical hypothyroidism and those who were euthyroid. However, those who had a TSH ≥10mU/L at presentation had a significantly increased risk of CHD and CHD mortality, but no difference in overall mortality.
There is evidence that treating subclinical hypothyroidism does not improve symptoms or quality of life.
There is insufficient data to look at whether treatment reduces the risk of CVD.
So, is this overdiagnosis? Shared decision-making and monitoring rather than treating is a very reasonable option until the evidence catches up and definitively guides us as to whether there are long-term benefits of treatment.
Please note: this does not apply to pregnant women for whom treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is still recommended.

What’s the evidence on linking hormonal contraception to depression?
Some research links hormonal contraception with increased antidepressant use, and even suicide. But does the evidence support this?
""Can I change to a different pill?"", Abigail asks. ""I have been having terrible mood swings. It all seems to be since I started the pill 3 months ago. This is just not like me. My partner and friends have noticed it and are worried. It must be the pill.""
So, what is the evidence around hormonal contraception and depression? And how will you advise Abigail?
Research from Scandanavia has found that use of hormonal contraception may be associated with increased antidepressant use and an increased risk of suicide.
The FRSH points out that there are limitations to studies in this area, and they do not prove a casual link between hormonal contraceptive use and depression.
Mood disorders in women may be mutifactorial.
A history of depression is NOT a contraindication (UKMEC 1) to any method of contraception.
Offering women contraceptive choice reduces the risk of an unintended pregnancy which could worsen her mental health.
We should counsel women about possible side-effects of hormonal contraception - including mood changes - and offer an alternative if a specific method is causing problems.

What’s all the fuss about FIT?
Several indications for use, different cut-off thresholds for different uses...We summarise the NICE guidance, BJGP and other articles on the use of the faecal immunochemical test.
The faecal immunochemical test (FIT) is a new way to test for occult blood in stool. It is replacing the traditional guaiac-based faecal occult stool test.
FIT can detect human haemoglobin in stool at very low levels. It has a much lower false positive rate than guaiac testing because it is not influenced by food consumed. It is specific for lower GI blood loss and requires one test, rather than three – so, if your patient is sent just one test kit, the FIT is being used. It is a quantitative test so the amount of blood in the stool can also be determined. This allows different thresholds to be set which will adjust the sensitivity and specificity of the test.
There are three ways the FIT test can be used, each of which involves different cut-off thresholds being applied.
Colorectal cancer screening: FIT is the screening test of choice for the national screening programme from 2019.
Patients with ‘low-but-not-no-risk’ symptoms for colorectal cancer: used as a ‘rule-in’ test. Those testing positive are most likely to benefit from an urgent colonoscopy. A negative FIT makes a diagnosis of colorectal cancer unlikely BUT, if symptoms persist, further investigations (for colorectal or other cancers) should be considered: safety-net well.
To triage 2ww colonoscopy list: as a rule-out test for patients with higher risk symptoms who meet referral criteria. This is controversial and is not part of standard practice yet. It is being tested in large clinical trials to see if it is safe to use in this context.
NICE updated its ‘Suspected cancer referral guidelines’ to recommend the FIT rather than the guaiac FOB test. NICE says we can offer faecal immunochemical testing to assess for colorectal cancer in people without rectal bleeding who have unexplained symptoms that could be suggestive of colorectal cancer but who meet no other referral criteria, allowing us the freedom to decide when the test might be appropriate and to refer if positive.

Do emollients really pose a fire risk?

Emollients are the mainstay of treatment for eczema. But people do die from emollient-associated fires and it’s that time of year when people switch their heating on. What should we advise patients?

Do emollients really pose a fire risk?
Emollients are the mainstay of treatment for eczema. But people do die from emollient-associated fires and it’s that time of year when people switch their heating on. What should we advise patients?
People can, and do, die from fire associated with emollient use.
In 2018, the MHRA recommended that patients should be given 'clear advice not to smoke or go near naked flames, and information about the risk of severe burn injury or death when clothing, bedding and dressings with emollients dried on them are accidentally ignited'.
This advice applies to all emollients, whether they contain paraffin or not.
Emollients are the mainstay of treatment for everyone with eczema. They should continue to be used when stepping up treatment.
Autumn is here and patients will be starting to turn on their heating - so now may be the time to think about fire risk and advise patients.

Osteoarthritis: which treatments work and how do we encourage self management?

Osteoarthritis: which treatments work and how do we encourage self management?
Osteoarthritis is extremely common and a growing problem in the UK. We spend between 1 and 2.5% of our GDP on the direct costs of this condition and the indirect costs are likely to be even higher.
And yet, many patients with osteoarthritis report feeling unsupported and feel they have to ‘accept’ their arthritis as an inevitable part of ageing.
Primary care can make a big difference to patients with osteoarthritis, but what can we say, and how we say it, really matters. The old adage of 'wear and tear' just doesn't fit the bill. If we think about it, phrases like this imply an inevitable need for surgery and don't make it particularly likely that our patients will engage in exercise and movement...I mean, if your brakes are 'worn and torn', you don't want to take the car out for a long drive.
So, what can we do instead? How can we share understanding of the condition and help patients to engage in self-management? What core treatments do work and where can we access them?
We have teamed up with Versus Arthritis to bring you a Pearl on osteoarthritis – it’s a long one but worth digesting with a nice cup of tea. And we've produced a free webinar: Osteoarthritis: primary care matters, watch on demand today.
How do we tackle addiction to prescribed drugs?

Shocking headlines appeared in the press recently: ‘1 in 4 people take addictive medicines’, prompting ‘The NHS must take action!’. Where have these numbers come from, are they true, and what can we do?

How do we tackle addiction to prescribed drugs?
Shocking headlines appeared in the press recently: ‘1 in 4 people take addictive medicines’, prompting ‘The NHS must take action!’. Where have these numbers come from, are they true, and what can we do?
'1 in 4 people take addictive medicines', finds a Public Health England review. The Mail Online says, 'The NHS must take action!'
So, where have these numbers come from - and what can we do?
These reports were based on PHE prescribing analysis using CPRD data from 2017. The analysis looked at 5 drug classes: antidepressants, benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, opiods and gabapentinoids.
In 12 months between 2017 and 2018, 11.5 million adults in the UK were prescribed at least one of these drugs. To put this into context, this means around 17% of the adult population were being prescribed antidepressants and around 3% were being prescribed gabapentinoids. These prescription rates are higher in women, and higher in areas of deprivation.
The average duration of prescription has gone up from 3 months to over 12 months since the last evaluation in 2015. This report also attracted a fair bit of controversy about whether antidepressants should have been lumped indiscriminately in with these other drug classes, and this is a legitimate point.
In light of these findings, PHE made several recommendations to the NHS to promote awareness of the harms of these drugs and better shared understanding with patients:
1. Make prescribing data more transparent and accessible (Ben Goldacre's site https://openprescribing.net/ is a good place to start if you want to find out about your own trends).
2. Improve patient information leaflets on these treatments.
3. Improve NHS support for patients with dependence on these drugs.
4. Do further research on prevention and treatment of dependence on prescribed drugs.
5. Set up a national drug dependence patient helpline.
While these aims are laudable, they don't give us, as clinicians on the ground, many useful tools we can use with our patients who are struggling with chronic pain.
At Red Whale, we recognise that managing chronic pain in primary care with limited resources is an area many of us fid challenging. Introducing the concept of self-care to patients can be difficult for us and patients. Our medical model is that we should be able to 'do something' for the patient, and the patient can perceive that the idea of self-care is suggesting they are 'wasting our time' or it is 'all in their heads'.
This is a complex area, so much so that we dedicate a whole course to it. But we would liek to share with you some of the strategies we have found helpful around introducing the concept of self-care. This is one part of the jigsaw.

Customer feedback
Whether in large interactive lectures or smaller, locally commissioned seminars, we provide an engaging and interactive approach to learning, geared towards practice changing actions.

We then turn those updates into high quality content which can be tailored to your specific needs and those of your audiences, be it single or multidisciplinary.
At every Red Whale course your delegates will receive five hours of face to face teaching, delivered in a location of your choice by one of our experienced GP presenters. They will also take home a copy of the course handbook and 12 months access to gpcpd.com – our in-consultation search facility, online handbook and CPD tracking platform.
With In-House courses we can offer a lot more flexibility in terms of content and method of delivery than it is possible on our scheduled courses.

Our full day face to face courses are our most popular option but by no means the only one.
For private audiences we can provide a blended-learning environment which is solution focused, drives engagement, practice change and more importantly, suits a range of different learning styles.
By combining traditional methods with online materials, we provide learners with interactive content and empower them to have more control of their learning as well as more fun!
What are the options?
Commissioned live webinars – One hour webinars produced to your specification from our award winning team, taking into account your desired learning outcomes and messages you want your audience to take away. These are available in a variety of different formats:
Chat show style
One or two Red Whale presenters have an informal interview with a specialist (i.e. secondary care consultant, an expert of your organisation or other eminent figure in the field)
We have successfully delivered this type of webinars for high profile customers such as Macmillan and Versus Arthritis. Watch them free of charge by visiting this page
Big Ask
The learners are asked to send in their questions on any topic
A panel of Red Whale presenters spends an hour answering these questions
We have delivered this type of webinar for CCGs following a traditional face to face course or series of webinars
Talking heads
A Red Whale presenter with a special interest in the topic spends 45-60 minutes covering the most practice changing evidence-based updates on the subject
We have been running this type of programme successfully with customers which include The Centre for Pharmacy Postgraduate Education (CPPE)
Group access to existing webinars and online courses – We have a growing catalogue of webinars and online courses to provide bite sized learning to remote audiences, smaller teams or teams who can’t all take the day off at the same time. These can be accessed for 12 months from initial purchase and can can be watched over and over again! The high-quality resources included with the video content make it an ideal option for self-study, during in-practice meetings or protected learning time.
Online handbooks – Providing a solid base with in-consultation resources for the whole team or addressing PUNS and DENS as they arise is something we get asked for often. www.GPCPD.com provides extensive chapterised and indexed material covering about 97% of the RCGP determined curriculum for Primary Care. We are working on the remaining 3%!
Focussed Learning activities, ideas for audit and quality improvement exercises are offered at the end of each online article. These can be carried out at home or as a practice wide exercise. They cement the learning and provide opportunities for practice changing outcomes. And of course, this material is updated at least every 12 months.
Printed handbooks – Still as popular as ever, they are the go-to reference sources in consultation for many more classically trained audiences.
Any combination of the above, whatever the needs of your area are, we can find learning options to suit you, and your audience.
Once we have answered all your questions, provided you with a quote, clarified what you need to provide, and found a suitable date, you will hopefully decide to commission your course with us.
At this point we’ll continue to be right by your side to support you with one dedicated point of contact who will be available to answer your questions and guide you through the course organisation process.
They will:
Provide information about the logistical aspects of the course, general information on content, and put you in touch with your course presenter who can discuss specific content details with you and help you cater to the needs of your locality if required.
Create personalised marketing materials to promote your course to your audiences – be it a flyer, content for a webpage or a series of promotional emails.
Provide you with guidance on the logistics and visual equipment requirements to ensure your course is a success.
Liaise with the venue to arrange delivery of our training materials, and confirm they’ve been delivered, for your peace of mind.
Collect feedback from the delegates on the day of the course and send it to you electronically.
They’ll be no further than a phone call away on the day of your course should you have any last minute queries.
We have a dedicated In-House courses team who will be more than happy to chat things through with you to help you decide the best training solution for your needs, your circumstances and your budget.
Whether you are thinking of a very simple update course for the GPs in your area or a more elaborate bespoke programme for multidisciplinary audiences in a variety of media, why not start straight away by dropping us a line and giving us some details about what you are looking for and how you would like to be contacted?
Email us at inhousecourses@red-whale.co.uk or if you’d prefer you can catch us on the phone - 03330 093 090.
