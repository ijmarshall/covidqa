Updated 20 March, 2020
The government has announced that we have moved into the second ‘delay’ phase of the published Coronavirus Action Plan. This recognises that we are seeing more cases of coronavirus in the community, and that we need to take action.
In this blog we’ll answer some of the questions many people have. We’ll update this blog as new information becomes available.
Please note we cannot answer any questions that relate to individual health concerns.
What is coronavirus and should I be concerned?
A coronavirus is a type of virus. As a group, coronaviruses are common across the world.
Generally, coronavirus can cause more severe symptoms in people with weakened immune systems, older people, and those with long term conditions like diabetes, cancer and chronic lung disease.
What are the signs and symptoms of this new virus?
The most common symptoms of this new coronavirus (COVID-19) are a new continuous cough and/or high temperature. Some people may also experience muscle aches, tiredness and shortness of breath.
If you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus, however mild, you should stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started.
If you live with others and you or another member of the household has symptoms, everyone in the household must stay at home for 14 days. This 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the household became ill.
See our guidance for more information.
How does this new coronavirus spread?
The main route of transmission is from cough and sneeze droplets. These droplets fall on people in the vicinity and can be directly inhaled or picked up on the hands and transferred when someone touches their face.
How long any respiratory virus survives will depend on a number of factors; for example:
what surface the virus is on
whether it is exposed to sunlight
differences in temperature and humidity
exposure to cleaning products
Under most circumstances, the amount of infectious virus on any contaminated surfaces is likely to have decreased significantly by 24 hours, and even more so by 48 hours.
Should I stay at home from now on?
If you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus (a new continuous cough and/or high temperature), you should stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started.
If you live with others and you or another member of the household has symptoms, everyone in the household must stay at home for 14 days. This 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the household became ill. See our stay at home for more information.
If you and your household do not have symptoms of coronavirus, you do not need to self-isolate at home. However, we should all be taking measures to reduce interaction between people to reduce the spread of the virus.
What is social distancing and what do I need to do?
Social distancing measures are steps we should all take to reduce social interaction between people. This will help to reduce the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19) and protect vulnerable people.
Read our social-distancing guidance to find out more.
What else can I do to make sure I don’t catch coronavirus?
In addition to reducing your contact with other people, there are things you can do to help stop germs like coronavirus spreading:
always carry tissues with you and use them to catch your cough or sneeze. Then bin the tissue, and wash your hands, or use a sanitiser gel
wash your hands more often than usual, for 20 seconds each time with soap and water or hand sanitiser, especially when you:
get home or into work
blow your nose, sneeze or cough
eat or handle food
avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands
avoid close contact with people who are unwell
Read more in our blog about some of the other simple and effective actions everyone can take to protect themselves and their wider community.
How many cases do we have in the UK?
As of 9am on 19 March 2020, 64,621 people have been tested in the UK, of which 61,352 were confirmed negative and 3,269 were confirmed as positive. 144 patients who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) have sadly died.
We will update these figures daily.
Will everyone who has symptoms get tested?
As we have now moved into the delay phase of the outbreak, we will start to change who gets tested. We now understand that the virus is widely circulating in the community which means that we should assume that anyone with symptoms has coronavirus.
We are working to increase the number of tests to 25,000 a day. This increased capacity is expected to be ready within 4 weeks.
Older and vulnerable groups will be prioritised, to ensure that they access the right treatment and care quickly. People who are generally well will not be tested and should manage their condition at home.
Can I travel abroad?
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) now advises British people against all non-essential travel worldwide. This advice took effect on 17 March applies initially for a period of 30 days.
Will I still be told if I’ve come into contact with someone who has coronavirus?
We recently blogged about contact tracing which is one of the ways we protect the public from infectious diseases like novel coronavirus (COVID-19).
In the contain phase of the outbreak, we were identifying all cases, tracing their contacts and following up with them to determine their level of risk and giving them advice and information on what to do should they become unwell
Now, because the virus is more widespread, we will not necessarily be able to determine where someone has contracted the virus and we will have a more targeted approach to contact tracing.
The targeted approach will likely include tracing close contacts of vulnerable people. For example, those in care homes or other institutions.
If you think you have been in contact with someone who has the virus, you no longer need to take action, unless you start to feel unwell yourself.
Is hand sanitiser effective?
The best way to protect yourself from infections like coronavirus is to regularly wash your hands with soap and water. If soap or water aren’t available and your hands are visibly clean, then sanitiser gel can be used. But proper hand washing is the most effective method and this should be your first choice.
Should people wear face masks to protect themselves from infection?
Face masks play a very important role in clinical settings, such as hospitals but there’s very little evidence of widespread benefit from their use outside of these clinical settings. Facemasks must be worn correctly, changed frequently, removed properly and disposed of safely in order to be effective.
How do we know if the virus is evolving?
PHE has used whole genome sequencing to sequence the viral genome from the first two positive cases in this country and has made the sequence available to the scientific community. Our findings are consistent with viral genomes sequenced in China, and we are not seeing changes that suggest the virus has evolved in the last month.
What advice have professional groups being given?
We have produced a range of advice for health professionals and other organisations such as schools and businesses. This is all available on gov.uk.

Hi Esther, this is a rapidly evolving situation which we are monitoring carefully but based on the available evidence, the current risk to the UK is low and no confirmed cases of Wuhan coronavirus have been detected in the UK.

What is your advice for those returning back to the UK from other provinces of China? (i.e. not Wuhan)

Hi Emily,
•	Health information will be available at airports with direct flights from China.
•	If there is evidence of sustained human to human transmission outside of China, we will update our enhanced monitoring measures in the relevant ports accordingly.
•	If you develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of travel to Wuhan, and are now in the UK, please stay indoors and avoid contact with others where possible, call your GP or ring 111 informing them of your symptoms and your recent travel to the city.
•	More information is available at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-information-for-the-public

In the light of the recent case in Germany where a symptomless Chinese employee from Shanghai passed the virus on to a German colleague in a meeting, two days before she herself felt unwell, why are we not stopping all flights from China to fully contain the virus? The US and other countries are starting to advise no travel to any part of China.

Hi Elle,
•	There has been no evidence of sustained human to human transmission outside China.
•	We believe Wuhan is the source of the virus, and we have a team of public health experts established in Heathrow to support anyone travelling in from China who feels unwell.
•	Health information will be available at airports with direct flights from China.
•	If there is evidence of sustained human to human transmission outside of China, we will update our enhanced monitoring measures in the relevant ports accordingly.
•	Our approach is at all times informed by the data shared by China and the WHO, and the advice of the Chief Medical Officer and independent experts.
•	As you would expect, we remain in close contact with the World Health Organization and other Government’s across the world.

Hi Morgan,
Face masks play a very important role in clinical settings, such as hospitals. However, there is very little evidence of widespread benefit from their use outside of these clinical settings. Facemasks must be worn correctly, changed frequently, removed properly, disposed of safely and used in combination with good universal hygiene behaviour in order for them to be effective. Research also shows that compliance with these recommended behaviours reduces over time when wearing facemasks for prolonged periods. People concerned about the transmission of infectious diseases would do better to prioritise good personal, respiratory and hand hygiene.

Hi,
Can the virus survive on Cargo if the packages have originated from an affected area.
We deal with China extensively and have concerned employees in our distribution Centres.
Thank you

Hi Rob,
There is no current evidence to suggest that the virus can be transmitted from (post/packages/parcels) from China.

Hello, what is the government's latest advice for recently returned travellers from other parts of mainland China, e.g. Beijing? Is self-isolation needed? If yes, how many days is necessary? Many thanks.

Hi Machelle,
If you have travelled from elsewhere in China (but not Macao or Hong Kong) to the UK in the last 14 days and develop symptoms of cough, fever or shortness of breath, you should immediately stay indoors and avoid contact with other people as you would with the flu and call NHS 111 to inform them of your recent travel to the country. If you are in Northern Ireland, call 0300 200 7885.

I work in a hospital and wanted to leave positive feedback as the hospital has provided notice boards on all the exits with advice on the virus and what to do if you think you have symptoms. All patients and staff are being urged to wash and gel hands before entering the hospital and any ward. This will help to remind anyone working in this enviroment the importance of the simple hand hygiene that takes a few moments of their time:)

Dear Editor,
Your blog says ""The symptoms of this new coronavirus (now known as COVID-19)"".
Is not the virus called SARS-CoV-2
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.937862v1
the disease COVID-19

DHSC and PHE statement on coronavirus
Statement from the Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England on the coronavirus situation in Wuhan, China.
Published 22 January 2020
From:
Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England
We have been carefully monitoring the coronavirus situation in Wuhan and are ready to put in place proportionate, precautionary measures.
From today, enhanced monitoring will be in place from all direct flights from Wuhan to the UK. The enhanced monitoring package includes a number of measures to provide advice to travellers if they feel unwell.
For those travelling back directly from Wuhan, this includes a Port Health team who will meet each direct flight aircraft to provide advice and support to those that feel unwell. The team will include a principal port medical inspector, port health doctor, administrative support and team leader.
They will check for symptoms of coronavirus and provide information to all passengers about symptoms and what to do if they become ill. Mandarin and Cantonese language support will be available to Public Health England (PHE) and leaflets will be available to passengers.
There are 3 direct flights a week that arrive at Heathrow from Wuhan. The enhanced monitoring of direct flights will be kept under continuous review and expanded to other Chinese departure points if necessary.
Leaflets and information will be made available across all UK airports, advising travellers from China on what do to if they feel unwell.
The risk to the UK population has been assessed as low, based on the emerging evidence regarding case numbers, potential sources and human to human transmission. This has been raised from very low due to evidence on the likelihood of cases being imported into this country.
There are no confirmed cases of this new infection in the UK.
DHSC has issued clinical guidance for the detection and diagnosis of Wuhan novel coronavirus, and PHE has developed a diagnostic test, making the UK one of the first countries outside China to have a prototype specific laboratory test for this new disease.
The UK is well prepared for new diseases and our approach is kept under constant review. UK public health measures are world-leading and the NHS is well prepared to manage and treat new diseases.
Dr Nick Phin, Deputy Director, National Infection Service, PHE, said:
This is a new and rapidly evolving situation where information on cases and the virus is being gathered and assessed daily. Based on the available evidence, the current risk to the UK is considered low. We are working with the WHO and other international partners, have issued advice to the NHS and are keeping the situation under constant review.
If you are travelling to Wuhan, you should maintain good hand, respiratory and personal hygiene and should avoid visiting animal and bird markets or people who are ill with respiratory symptoms. Individuals should seek medical attention if they develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of visiting Wuhan, either in China or on their return to the UK. They should phone ahead before attending any health services and mention their recent travel to the city.

What to do if you have symptoms
Stay at home for 7 days if you have either:
a high temperature
a new continuous cough
if you live with other people, they should stay at home for 14 days from the day the first person got symptoms.
This will help to protect others in your community while you are infectious.
Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.
You do not need to contact NHS 111 to tell them you’re staying at home.
Testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home.
Read the guidance about staying at home.
Number of cases
As of 9am on 20 March 2020, 66,976 people have been tested in the UK, of which 62,993 were confirmed negative and 3,983 were confirmed positive.
As of 1pm, 177 patients in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) have died.
Cases identified in England
Confirmed cases in each local authority and NHS region are published by Public Health England (PHE).
Risk level
The risk to the UK has been raised to high.
Recent government action
The government published its coronavirus action plan on 3 March.
On 10 February, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, announced strengthened legal powers to protect public health.
The Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 have been put in place to reduce the risk of further human-to-human transmission in this country by keeping individuals in isolation where public health professionals believe there is a reasonable risk an individual may have the virus.

How government works
In the UK, the Prime Minister leads the government with the support of the Cabinet and ministers. You can find out who runs government and how government is run, as well as learning about the history of government.
Who runs government
The Prime Minister
The Prime Minister is the leader of Her Majesty’s Government and is ultimately responsible for all policy and decisions.
The Prime Minister also:
oversees the operation of the Civil Service and government agencies
appoints members of the government
is the principal government figure in the House of Commons
The Prime Minister is The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP.
Read more about the Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is made up of the senior members of government. Every week during Parliament, members of the Cabinet (Secretaries of State from all departments and some other ministers) meet to discuss the most important issues for the government.
See who is in the Cabinet
Ministers
Ministers are chosen by the Prime Minister from the members of the House of Commons and House of Lords. They are responsible for the actions, successes and failures of their departments.
See full list of ministers
How government is run
Government departments and agencies
Departments and their agencies are responsible for putting government policy into practice.

Agencies & other public bodies
Government departments
Some departments, like the Ministry of Defence, cover the
whole UK. Others don’t – the Department for Work and Pensions doesn't cover Northern Ireland. This is because some aspects of government are devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Non-ministerial departments are headed by senior civil servants and not ministers. They usually have a regulatory or inspection function like the Charity Commission.
Executive agencies
These are part of government departments and usually provide government services rather than decide policy - which is done by the department that oversees the agency.
An example is the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (overseen by the Department for Transport).
Other public bodies
These have varying degrees of independence but are directly accountable to ministers. There are 4 types of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs).
Executive NDPBs do work for the government in specific areas - for example, the Environment Agency.
Advisory NDPBs provide independent, expert advice to ministers - for example, the Committee on Standards in Public Life.
Tribunal NDPBs are part of the justice system and have jurisdiction over a specific area of law - for example, the Competition Appeal Tribunal.
Independent monitoring boards are responsible for the running of prisons and treatment of prisoners - for example, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons.
Civil Service
The Civil Service does the practical and administrative work of government. It is co-ordinated and managed by the Prime Minister, in their role as Minister for the Civil Service.
Around half of all civil servants provide services direct to the public, including:
paying benefits and pensions
running employment services
staffing prisons
issuing driving licences
The Civil Service is on GOV.UK.
Work for us
Find and apply for vacancies in departments, executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies.

Get involved

Engage with government
Interact with government through consultations and petitions to inform and influence the decisions it makes.
Take part
Offer your skills and energy to a project in your neighbourhood, around the UK or overseas.
Legislation
Laws go through several stages before they are passed by Parliament. The House of Commons and the House of Lords work together to make them.
They can include:
Draft legislation
White papers outline proposals for new laws. Green papers ask for public comments before the white paper is published.
Bills are proposals for new laws or changes to existing ones. Once agreed by Parliament, they have to be approved by The Queen before becoming law.
Acts of Parliament
These are bills which have been approved by the Commons, the Lords, and The Queen. The relevant government department is responsible for putting the act into practice.
Visit www.legislation.gov.uk
Access to information
Freedom of information
The Freedom of Information Act gives you the right to ask any public sector organisation for all the recorded information it has on any subject. Anyone can make a request for information – known as a Freedom of Information (or FOI) request.
There are no restrictions on your age, nationality or where you live.
How to make a freedom of information request
See FOI releases on GOV.UK
Statistics
Government produces Official Statistics about most areas of public life. Statistics are used by people inside and outside government to make informed decisions and to measure the success of government policies and services. Find out about the legislation that governs the publication of UK national and Official Statistics.
See statistics publications on GOV.UK
Transparency
The government publishes information about how government works to allow you to make politicians, public services and public organisations more accountable. We are committed to publishing information about:
how much public money has been spent on what
the job titles of senior civil servants and how much they are paid
how the government is doing against its objectives
See transparency releases on GOV.UK
Data
Putting data in people’s hands can help them have more of a say in the reform of public services. On data.gov.uk you can easily find, review and use information about our country and communities - for example, to develop web applications.
Devolved government
In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, devolved administrations are responsible for many domestic policy issues, and their Parliaments/Assemblies have law-making powers for those areas.
Areas the Scottish Government, Welsh Government, and the Northern Ireland Executive are responsible for, include:
health
education
culture
the environment
transport
Local government
Councils make and carry out decisions on local services. Many parts of England have 2 tiers of local government: county councils and district, borough or city councils.
In some parts of the country, there’s just one tier of local government providing all the functions, known as a ‘unitary authority’. This can be a city, borough or county council – or it may just be called ‘council’. As well as these, many areas also have parish or town councils.
Understand how your council works
Parliament
Parliament is separate from government. Made up of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, its role is to:
look at what the government is doing
debate issues and pass new laws
set taxes
Find out about how Parliament works
Read The Official Report at Hansard
History of government
Britain has one of the oldest governments in the world. Find out more about how it has worked and who has shaped it in the history section.
Read about past Prime Ministers, Chancellors and Foreign Secretaries in notable people. Learn more about historic government buildings on Whitehall and around the UK.
You can also find links to historical research, documents and records.

Technical information about this website’s accessibility
The Government Digital Service is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard.
Non-accessible content
The content that is not accessible is outlined below with details of:
where it fails the success criteria
planned dates for when issues will be fixed
Some non-English pages have attachments in more than one language, and the language for the attachments is not identified, nor indicated within the files. This fails WCAG 2.1A 3.1.1 success criterion (Language of Page). We plan to fix this by September 2020.
A small number of pages have content in different languages where the language is not identified. This fails WCAG 2.1A 3.1.1 success criterion (Language of Page). We plan to fix this by October 2019.
Some tables in content do not have table row headers when needed. This fails WCAG 2.1A 1.3.1 success criterion (Info and Relationships). This is a limitation of the publishing tool which we plan to fix by October 2019.
Focused links and buttons sometimes do not have enough contrast. This fails WCAG 1.4.11 AA (Non-text Contrast). We plan to fix this by October 2019.
Disproportionate burden
Not applicable
Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations
The following content does not need to comply with the accessibility requirement until September 2020, because it was published before September 2018.
Images on pages do not always have suitable alternative text. Some images are missing alternative text, some have incomplete text and some have ‘placeholder’ as alternative text. This fails WCAG 1.1.1A success criterion (Non-text Content). We plan to identify and fix these by September 2020.
Headings on some pages are not in a logical nested order. We plan to identify and fix these by September 2020.
In addition to the pages identified above, some other pages have content in different languages where the language is not identified. This fails WCAG 2.1 A 3.1.1 success criterion (Language of Page). We plan to identify and fix these by September 2020.
Buttons on some pages do not have a correct role identified, which affects how they work with assistive technology. This fails WCAG 2.1A success criterion (Name, Role, Value). We plan to identify and fix these by September 2020.
Error messages on some forms are unclear or lack clear association with particular form controls. This fails WCAG 2.1A 3.3.1 success criterion (Error Identification).
Guidance will be created to help content authors understand the requirements for captions and audio description for all new videos. This is related to WCAG 2.1A success criteria 1.2.2 (Captions (Prerecorded)) and 1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded).

Details
This guidance outlines infection control for healthcare providers assessing possible cases of COVID-19. It should be used in conjunction with local policies.
In the absence of effective drugs or a vaccine, control of this disease relies on the prompt identification, appropriate risk assessment, management and isolation of possible and confirmed cases, and the investigation and follow up of close contacts to minimise potential onward transmission.
This video shows how to safely don (put on) PPE specific to COVID-19 and should be used in conjunction with the quick guide to donning PPE and local policies.

Guidance for non-clinical settings
Guidance for health professionals
The advice for anyone in any setting is to follow these main guidelines.
The most common symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) are recent onset of a new continuous cough and/or high temperature. If you have these symptoms, however mild, stay at home and do not leave your house for 7 days from when your symptoms started. You do not need to call NHS 111 to go into self-isolation. If your symptoms worsen during home isolation or are no better after 7 days, contact NHS 111 online. If you have no internet access, you should call NHS 111. For a medical emergency dial 999.
Wash your hands more often than usual, for 20 seconds using soap and hot water, particularly after coughing, sneezing and blowing your nose, or after being in public areas where other people are doing so. Use hand sanitiser if that’s all you have access to.
To reduce the spread of germs when you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, or your sleeve (not your hands) if you don’t have a tissue, and throw the tissue in a bin immediately. Then wash your hands or use a hand sanitising gel.
Clean and disinfect regularly touched objects and surfaces using your regular cleaning products to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to other people.
At the current time and based on our understanding of what is known of COVID-19 and other similar respiratory viruses, it is likely that older people and those with chronic medical conditions may be vulnerable to severe disease. As more information emerges, recommendations may change.

Details
This guidance is intended for:
people with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, and do not require hospital treatment, who must remain at home until they are well
those living in households with someone who shows symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus
The main messages are:
if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. See ending isolation section for more information
if you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill
for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14-day isolation period. See ending isolation section for more information
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community
if you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period
if you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible
if you have coronavirus symptoms:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
you do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home
testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home
plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home and consider what can be done for vulnerable people in the household
ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home
wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water, or use hand sanitiser
if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.
If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111.

Video: How to wash your hands properly
What to do if you have symptoms
Stay at home for 7 days if you have either:
a high temperature
a new continuous cough
if you live with other people, they should stay at home for 14 days from the day the first person got symptoms.
This will help to protect others in your community while you are infectious.
Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.
You do not need to contact NHS 111 to tell them you’re staying at home.
Testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home.
Read the guidance about staying at home.
Number of cases
As of 9am on 20 March 2020, 66,976 people have been tested in the UK, of which 62,993 were confirmed negative and 3,983 were confirmed positive.
As of 1pm, 177 patients in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) have died.
Cases identified in England
Confirmed cases in each local authority and NHS region are published by Public Health England (PHE).
Risk level
The risk to the UK has been raised to high.
Recent government action
The government published its coronavirus action plan on 3 March.
On 10 February, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, announced strengthened legal powers to protect public health.
The Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 have been put in place to reduce the risk of further human-to-human transmission in this country by keeping individuals in isolation where public health professionals believe there is a reasonable risk an individual may have the virus.

Privacy notice
GOV.UK (or www.gov.uk) is provided by the Government Digital Service (GDS), part of the Cabinet Office.
Cabinet Office is the data controller for pages starting with www.gov.uk - for example, www.gov.uk/pip.
If you follow a link to a service provided by another government department, agency or local authority, that organisation will:
be the data controller
be responsible for processing any data you share with them
publish and manage their own privacy notice with details of how to contact them
Example
If you make a claim for Universal Credit www.universal-credit.service.gov.uk, the Department for Work and Pensions will be the responsible controller. The service’s own privacy notice will apply.
A data controller determines how and why personal data is processed. For more information, read the Cabinet Office’s entry in the Data Protection Public Register.
What data we collect
The personal data we collect from you includes:
questions, queries or feedback you leave, including your email address if you contact GOV.UK

We do not store your personal information through Google Analytics (for example your name or address).
We will not identify you through analytics information, and we will not combine analytics information with other data sets in a way that would identify who you are.
We continuously test and monitor our data protection controls to make sure they’re effective and to detect any weaknesses.

We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at all stages, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored.
All personal data is stored in the European Economic Area (EEA). Data collected by Google Analytics data may be transferred outside the EEA for processing.
How we protect your data and keep it secure
We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We have set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of your data - for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption.
We also make sure that any third parties that we deal with keep all personal data they process on our behalf secure.
