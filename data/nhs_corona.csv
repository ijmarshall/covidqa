Wherever you can help, your NHS needs you
Thank you for your interest in helping the NHS fight COVID-19. The virus has the potential to put huge additional demand on our NHS and our fellow citizens. Your support will make more of a difference than ever before, not just to patients, but to colleagues and the wider community.
If you have retired from the NHS in the last three years, your regulator will be emailing you to outline next steps.
If you have previously left the NHS – either temporarily or permanently – or a member of the public who would like to help on a voluntary basis, we’ll be keeping these pages updated as frequently as possible, so please watch this space.
We will also be making announcements via the media, including social media.
Even if you fall into a group which is considered to be at increased risk, you can still offer valuable support through a variety of roles in secondary, community and primary care that are not patient-facing.
Thank you for your interest in helping the NHS fight against coronavirus.
Returning nurses and midwives
If you wish to join the Covid-19 temporary register as a nurse or midwife please visit the NMC’s website and complete their application form. You can find answers to some frequently asked questions here.
Returning doctors

Returning pharmacists and pharmacy technicians

Returning Biomedical Scientists and Clinical Scientists
Your interest and support is hugely appreciated.
Information on how to offer your help will appear here from Monday.
Questions can be emailed to nhsi.returntowork@nhs.net

Wherever you can help, you’re needed
As a fully-qualified and experienced health and social care professional who has either temporarily or permanently left the NHS, your colleagues and local community are in urgent need of your support to join the fight against COVID-19 in a number of different ways that don’t have to involve frontline care.
COVID-19 has the potential to put huge additional demand on our NHS and our fellow citizens. In such emergencies, the Government can allow the HCPC to grant temporary registration to certain groups in emergencies. By offering to return to the NHS now, you will make more of a difference than ever before, not just to patients, but to colleagues and the wider community.
This isn’t only about clinically treating patients – there is also a need to provide a calm and stoic presence whose ripple effect is felt way beyond any health or social care setting. Many members of the general public are anxious and need reassurance. Your expertise can help in so many ways, so even if you fall into a group which is considered to be at increased risk, you can still offer valuable support through a variety of roles in secondary, community and primary care.
We greatly appreciate the time and effort that you have already given the NHS and have put everything in place to ensure re-joining us is easy and safe for you. You can choose how much time you contribute and are free to stop working at any point. Your contract will reflect standard terms and conditions such as working hour protections, pay arrangements, and annual leave entitlement.
We would be extremely grateful for any help that you are able to offer and have developed a survey to help understand how best to use your skills. Please complete it to indicate whether this is something you’d be willing to consider. Understandably, you will have important questions to ask before making your decision, whether that be around your own health and wellbeing, professional indemnity, pensions or remuneration. We have aimed to answer many of these here but if you have any further queries, do please contact nhsi.AHP.returners@nhs.net.
Your expertise and experience will be valued beyond measure at this difficult time.
Thank you.
Frequently asked questions for AHPs
Will I be paid? If so, how much and how regularly?
You will be remunerated for any work you do in a way that reflects the responsibilities you undertake. Most AHPs returning to help will be asked to provide general support and be paid at Agenda for Change Band 5.
You may be asked to undertake work in line with the grade you were when you left the NHS, in which case you would be paid at that grade.
What are the pension payment arrangements for staff returning to the NHS to assist in the response to the COVID-19 outbreak?
The government is bringing forward emergency legislation in response to the COVID-19 outbreak that contains important information on pension arrangements for extra NHS staff. It provides for the suspension of the 16-hour rule which currently prevents staff who return to work after retirement from the 1995 NHS Pension Scheme from working more than 16 hours per week, in the first four weeks after retirement. It also provides for:
The suspension of both the abatement for special class status holders in the 1995 Scheme
The requirement for staff in the 2008 Section and 2015 NHS Pension Scheme to reduce their pensionable pay by 10% if they elect to ‘draw down’ a portion of their benefits and continue working.
Taken together, these measures will allow skilled and experienced staff who have recently retired from the NHS to return to work, and retired staff who have already returned to work to increase their commitments if required, without having their pension benefits suspended.
When will these measures take effect?
The legislation will give the Government the power to immediately bring these measures into effect, if required.
What will happen when these measures are no longer needed?
A six-month notice period will be given to staff and employers before these measures will cease to apply, at which point the relevant sections of the scheme regulations will take effect again. Staff and employers will therefore have six months’ notice to readjust their working patterns.
Can I help without being in a directly patient-facing role?
Yes. There are ample opportunities for non-patient facing roles, such as working with NHS 111.
Where will I be placed/could I be sent to another part of the country?
Where possible, you will be asked to work in an organisation where you have worked before or are linked with. There might be rare occasions where we would ask if you would consider moving to a different area to cover an acute workforce shortage, but this would be discussed with you beforehand.
Will I have insurance and indemnity cover?
Yes – arrangements are already in place to indemnity any professional working in a hospital trust or GP practice. You would still be expected to have personal professional indemnity insurance as you would previously have done.
Will I have to pay to go back onto the HCPC register?
Your expertise and experience will be valued beyond measure, so you won’t have to pay to temporarily return to the HCPC register.
Will I be expected to re-do an appraisal or re-validation process?
No, we appreciate that your existing skills and experience so this will not be necessary.
Will I receive an induction process?
Yes – you’ll receive a fast track induction locally that will cover key mandatory training requirements as well as more specific guidance, for example, on the management of coronavirus and use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
Will I need clearance from the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) – formerly the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB)?
Yes, though if you have a recent DBS Certificate or have maintained a subscription to the DBS Update Service then it may not be necessary for a further application to be submitted.
An assessment will be done by your employing organisation, using guidance from NHS Employers, to determine if a further check is required.
Where a new DBS application is required, the DBS are proposing to extend the scope of their services to include a new fast track check against the adults and/children’s barred lists. These arrangements will enable employers to recruit into a regulated activity before receiving the full disclosure certificate, where they have undertaken a risk assessment and put in place appropriate monitoring and supervision.
You will not be required to pay for a DBS check.
I have a co-morbidity or am a primary carer - can I also work?
Given the increased risk of COVID-19 in those with co-morbidity and in the elderly population, we would of course advise against returning to patient-facing clinical work if you belong to this group. However, there are a range of opportunities in non-patient facing roles that we are in urgent need of support with.
I’ve accepted temporary registration. What will happen next? How will I find out where I’ll be working?
Thank you for agreeing to join us in the fight against COVID-19. With permission, your contact details will be passed on to regional teams so that you can be linked with local organisations.
Will I be sent to multiple different clinics/hospitals or stay in one role?
Ideally you would be placed in one role, but this cannot be guaranteed.
Will I need to learn new skills?
Fast-track induction processes are being developed locally. This will include refreshing on old skills, as well as new skills such as PPE training.
What if I become ill when I am working?
If you become ill while working, you should immediately inform your line manager and withdraw from work. If you think you may be ill due to COVID-19 you should follow national guidance in place at the time (likely to be self-isolation).
What if I change my mind and don’t want to work anymore – who do I tell?
You are free to change your mind at any time. If you don’t want to work anymore you should tell your line manager.
Could I be asked to work in an area I am not familiar with?
As far as possible, we would aim to match your skills and experience to suitable specialties. In some situations, you may need to be placed in a different specialty according to need but would receive full support.
I am working in an educational or research role, what are the next steps for me?
If you have a joint contract between clinical and educational/research roles, your provider organisation will contact you to discuss whether you are prepared to give up these activities in the short term (unless working on education or research in relation to COVID-19) to provide more clinical support in the workplace. Those with teaching expertise may be able to help provide induction for others, including returning health care professionals – for example, in the use of PPE, managing high flow oxygen or ventilated patients (if appropriately trained to do so).
I work in a part time clinical role with a second non-clinical role - what are the next steps for me?
Discuss with your employers under what circumstances you should temporarily suspend your non-clinical commitments in order to provide more clinical support in your employing organisation. The balance between supporting front-line NHS services directly and delivering the business as usual work of organisations should be carefully balanced in each case.
What sort of work might I be expected to do? Will I have a choice?
There are multiple possible roles that you might be expected to take on including (but not limited to): contributing to the clinical part of the NHS111 service, backfill for clinicians dealing with acute respiratory patients, helping with outpatient clinics (this could be via telephone), training other clinicians and providing routine clinical cover.
How long will I be needed for?
You are likely to be needed for a short time period but at this stage, the exact length is unpredictable. You are free to stop working at any point. Contracts are likely to be drawn up for six months with the possibility for extension.
Will I have a contract?
Yes. You will have a contract that reflects all the working hour protections, pay arrangements, annual leave entitlement and hospital inductions that are provided to NHS employees.
What documentation do I need to have checked before I start work? Can this be done remotely?
Identify checks will be required but this will be a fast-track process with your local HR department.
Will I have a rota/need to work a specific number of hours?
Your working hours and pattern will be agreed between you and the department you will be placed in locally.
Will you check that I don’t have coronavirus?
If you develop symptoms, national guidance for testing will be followed.
Will I be provided with PPE if required?
Yes.
What happens if I treat patients while having coronavirus?
As soon as coronavirus is identified in staff, they will be withdrawn from work and contact tracing procedures will follow.
I haven’t been fit tested for the correct masks (FFP3)? Could I be asked to go into a room with a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19?
Clinicians preparing to assess a patient with suspected COVID-19 must wear PPE, which as a minimum should be:
A correctly fitted FFP3 respirator
Gown
Gloves
Eye protection
Clinicians seeing patients with confirmed COVID-19 must wear full PPE comprising of:
A FFP3 respirator
Disposable eye protection (and preferably a visor)
A long sleeved disposable gown
Gloves
For symptomatic, unconfirmed patients, clinicians should wear:
A fluid resistant surgical mask
Gloves
Apron
Eye protection if there is a risk of splashing into the eyes
I’m pregnant or immunosuppressed. What rights do I have to protect myself from infection at work?
Pregnant women and children are not thought to be at high risk. Immunosuppressed people may well be at increased risk, depending on the reason for the immunosuppression, drug type and dosage, and so on. A risk assessment will be conducted locally and you are advised to avoid COVID-19 exposure, which could mean redeployment to a non-frontline role. There are a range of opportunities in non-patient facing roles that we are in urgent need of support with, including (but not limited to) contributing to the clinical part of the NHS111 service,
backfill for clinicians dealing with acute respiratory patients, helping with outpatient clinics (this could be via telephone), training other clinicians and providing routine clinical cover.
Is there specific advice for other high risk chronic diseases?
People with chronic heart and lung disease have a higher risk of complications and higher mortality than the general population. Given the increased risk of COVID-19 for people in those groups, we would of course advise against returning to patient-facing clinical work. However, there are a range of opportunities in non-patient facing roles that we are in urgent need of support with.
How can I decline if I am asked to work beyond my clinical competence?
The HCPC acknowledges that you may be anxious about working in these very challenging circumstances. These are unprecedented times. If the epidemic worsens it is likely that clinicians will have to work outside their normal field of practice. When deciding the safest and best course of action in the circumstances, we’d encourage you to consider:
What is within your knowledge and skills
The protection and needs of all patients you have a responsibility towards
Minimising the risk of transmission and protecting your own health.
If a concern is raised about a registered professional, it will always be considered on the specific facts of the case, taking into account the factors relevant to the environment in which the professional is working. The HCPC would also take account of any relevant information about resources, guidelines, or protocols in place at the time.
I’m about to graduate as an AHP and would really like to help. Can I start work before I graduate?
We greatly appreciate your offer of support in the fight against COVID-19. HEE is in discussion with the HCPC and universities to see how you could safely help. We will share the outcome of these discussions as soon as we have it.

Dear Colleague
Covid-19 and professional standards activities (including appraisal and
revalidation)
I am writing about changes to professional standards activities in light of the latest
Government advice on managing the Covid-19 outbreak. Professional standards
activities safeguard patient safety and quality of care, support professional
development and ensure that action is taken when concerns arise.
However, in the
current situation it is entirely appropriate to free up capacity to maintain essential
care and minimise spread.
Medical Appraisal
As National Responsible Officer for NHS England and Improvement and the person
who delegates the Senior Responsible Owner function for The Medical Profession
(Responsible Officers) Regulations 2010 (amended 2013) in England I strongly
recommend that appraisals are suspended from the date of this letter until further
notice, unless there are exceptional circumstances agreed by both the appraisee
and appraiser.
This should immediately increase capacity in our workforce by
allowing appraisers to return to clinical practice.
Until reinstated, Responsible Officers (ROs) should classify appraisals which are
affected as ‘approved missed’ appraisals.
For clarity, affected appraisals will be
regarded as cancelled, not postponed.
Revalidation decisions
The GMC has now issued guidance that doctors who are due to revalidate before
the end of September 2020 will have their revalidation date deferred for one year.
This will be kept under review the GMC will make further deferrals as necessary.
This decision has been made to give doctors more time to reschedule and complete
appraisals, and to avoid the need for ROs to make revalidation recommendations
during this time.
The GMC has started making changes to its systems so that notifications about

NHS England and NHS Improvement
revalidation dates aren’t issued.
They will continue to send notifications when
doctors move on and off GMC connect lists so ROs can keep track of prescribed
connections.
Framework for Quality Assurance for Responsible Officers and Revalidation
In keeping with the need to minimise non-direct quality improvement activities, we
have decided to cancel the 2019/2020 Annual Organisation Audit, which we had
planned to launch on 6 April.
Mandatory training and other activities
Other measures to release clinical capacity and allow focus on the current priority
include amending local requirements for mandatory training and other CPD and
quality improvement activities not directly relevant to the current outbreak. I
encourage ROs to work within their organisations to make sensible changes in
these areas.
Responding to concerns about a doctor’s practice
Oversight of professional concerns must continue, but as the situation evolves, our
priority will be those concerns that are assessed as high risk.
I know that you and your teams are working hard to prepare for the challenge of the
coming weeks and months and hope that these measures will help you and your
clinicians to focus on best possible care for patients for the duration of this
outbreak.
Yours sincerely,
Professor Stephen Powis

21 March 2020
Dear Colleague,
CARING FOR PEOPLE AT HIGHEST RISK DURING COVID-19 INCIDENT
We are writing to update you on the latest advice that will be sent to all patients who
are considered to be at highest risk of severe illness that would require
hospitalisation from coronavirus (COVID-19).
A letter will be sent to these patients
asking them to stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact for at
least twelve weeks.
This builds on existing national guidance, including:
• https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/
• https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/
• https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus
This letter will be sent to patients who fall into one of the following groups (Further
detail on the Groups can be found at Annex 1 to the CMO letter this accompanies).
List of diseases and conditions considered to be very high risk (Group 1):
1. Solid organ transplant recipients
2. People with specific cancers
• People with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radical
radiotherapy for lung cancer
• People with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia,
lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment
• People having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for
cancer
• People having other targeted cancer treatments which can affect the immune
system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors.
• People who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last 6
months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs.
3. People with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic fibrosis, severe
asthma and severe COPD
4. People with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that significantly
increase the risk of infections (such as SCID, homozygous sickle cell disease)
5. People on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly increase risk of
infection
6. People who are pregnant with significant heart disease, congenital or acquired
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/
https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/
https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus

A copy of the letter sent to patients can be found in Annex 3. The patients of your
practice that have been contacted can be identified through an “at high risk” indicator
code that has been applied to each patient record by your clinical system supplier.
Your supplier will inform you of the code they have used, which should be treated as
temporary until a definitive list of COVID-19 ‘at risk’ SNOMED codes is released.
Your GP System supplier will also provide a report that will list those patients that
have been centrally identified as being at high risk.
You should have this by 23
March. We ask that you review this report for accuracy and, where any of these
patients have dementia, a learning disability or autism, that you provide appropriate
additional support to them to ensure they continue receiving access to care.
We have taken a two-pronged approach to identification of people on
immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly increase the risk of infection
(category 5). All patients on the following medications have been centrally identified
and will be contacted via the letter:
• Azathioprine
• Mycophenolate (both types)
• Cyclosporin
• Sirolimus
• Tacrolimus
Central datasets are not sophisticated enough to identify all categories of patients
who should be included in the vulnerable groups list. We are grateful for the help of
colleagues in the Medical Royal Colleges and societies who are cascading guidance
to secondary care to help them identify other high risk patients from their caseload.
We appreciate this is a complex task requiring difficult judgements, and we ask for
your help, as the GP central to the care of these patients, in achieving this. We are
writing to UK secondary care colleagues in two groups, (2 and 3):
Group 2
The Royal College of Physicians and associated medical societies will contact six
specialties1 with very specific guidance about identification of patients on
immunosuppression therapies who are among the very highest risk. We are unable
to adequately identify this group from central datasets which, for example, do not
reliably code patients taking biologics. We will ask specialists to identify such
patients from their caseload and contact the patients with a copy of the standard
letter and write to you with their names.
1 Dermatology, Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Neurology, Respiratory, Renal and
Rheumatology
3
Group 3
The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges will cascade more general guidance about
identifying other high risk groups across specialties. We will ask the wider group of
specialists to identify only those that they would consider to be at the very highest
risk, bearing in mind the severity and unpleasant nature of the intervention that will
be proposed for this group. We will also ask specialists to contact identified patients
with a copy of the standard letter and write to you with their names.
You may know of other patients (Group 4) who you would consider to be at very high
risk from infection. The RCGP will shortly publish guidance to support GPs
identifying additional high risk patients. The guidance will also support GPs to have
shared decision-making conversations with all high risk patients as needed, and help
GPs to understand what health needs these groups may have.
We ask that, if you choose to identify additional individuals you consider to be at
highest risk of severe outcomes, that you proactively contact this group of patients to
discuss your recommendation with them. There may be patients not in these
categories who contact you to say that they wish to be included in the group to be
shielded by the restrictive, stringent measures, and asking for a fit note to cover the
period of isolation. We ask you to use your professional judgement and consider the
RCGP guidance when advising this group.
The recommendation for shielding the very high-risk group is just that, and we ask
that your discussion with patients reflect this. Some patients may decide, on
weighing up the risks, that they would prefer not to follow the restrictive, stringent
measures. We ask that you help your patients to work through this if they wish to.
We also suggest that anybody with a terminal diagnosis who is thought to be in their
last 6 months of life should be excluded from this group (unless they wish to be
included), to allow them to maintain contact with their loved ones during the last
phase of their illness.
Please note this process is covered by your CNSGP arrangements in the usual way.
In addition, we ask that you take the action listed below with respect to patients in
your practice who are identified for the vulnerable group from any of the above
routes.
These discussions should align with the guidance set out in the letter we sent you on
19 March and upcoming RCGP guidance on supporting high risk patients.
1. Ongoing care arrangements
Please immediately review any ongoing care arrangements that you have with these
highest risk patients.
Wherever possible, patient contact, triage and treatment should be delivered via
phone, email or online. However, if you decide that the patient needs to be seen in
person, please arrange for your practice to contact them to organise a visit to the
surgery, a hub or their home as appropriate.
4
NHS Trusts have also been asked to review ongoing care arrangements and will
contact patients directly to make adjustments to hospital care and treatment as
needed.
2. Support with medicine supplies:
Patients have been informed that repeat prescription durations will not change during
this incident, and that patients will need to ensure that their medication can be
collected or delivered to them directly.
Repeatable prescriptions can be valid for a
year, but each repeat should be for no longer than the patient has now. For example,
if the patient has prescriptions for a 28 day supply now then the repeat dispensing
should be set up as 12 x 28 days’ supply.
Patients who currently have their medication delivered, by a chosen person or by a
pharmacy, should continue to do so.
Patients who need regular medicine, but have not yet set up online ordering and
delivery will need to be supported to do so.
We ask that you arrange that suitable
patients be put on electronic repeat dispensing as soon as possible in line with our
letter of 5 March.
Patients have been asked to arrange their own delivery or collection of their
prescriptions through a nominated person, online delivery or delivery from a
community pharmacy.
If they struggle to do this, we ask that your practice (via a
social prescriber) helps set up an appropriate arrangement.
3. Support with daily living
We have encouraged patients to discuss their daily needs with their carers, friends,
families and local voluntary groups.
This includes support for physical needs such
as food and shopping deliveries, as well as their mental health needs.
If patients contact you asking for help, we suggest that your social prescribing link
worker (or equivalent), where available, helps them to arrange additional support
and/or link them to local voluntary groups. Where not currently available, local
government and other voluntary sector organisations will also be able to arrange
support.
NHS England and NHS Improvement are also setting up a new volunteering portal
that they can use to access support for daily tasks.
This will be available from
Tuesday 24 March.
Given capacity, only the highest risk patients should be directed
to this service.
Patients who do not have family or friends that can help, can also be directed to
www.gov.uk/coronavirus-extremely-vulnerable to register for additional support with
daily living tasks such as shopping and social care.
Patients have been told that the letter they have received can be used as evidence
for their employer, to show that they cannot work outside the home.

Urgent medical attention
All patients who display symptoms of COVID-19, have been asked to contact the
NHS 111 online coronavirus service, or call NHS 111 if they do not have access to
the internet.
However, if patients have an urgent medical question relating to their pre-existing
condition, we have asked that they contact you, or their specialist consultant,
directly.
4. Looking after your own health
It is important that you look after your and your practice staff’s own health and
wellbeing at this time.
If, at any point, you think you or a member of your team have developed symptoms
of COVID-19, such as a new, continuous cough and/or high temperature (above
37.8), seek clinical advice using the NHS 111 online coronavirus service
(https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/) or, if you do not have access to the internet, call NHS
111.
You can also access support for managing your own mental health from the free,
confidential NHS Practitioner Health Service (https://www.practitionerhealth.nhs.uk/).
Please accept our sincere thanks for your help, patience and support at this
challenging time.
Yours sincerely

Details
This guidance is intended for:
people with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, and do not require hospital treatment, who must remain at home until they are well
those living in households with someone who shows symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus
The main messages are:
if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. See ending isolation section for more information
if you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill
for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14-day isolation period. See ending isolation section for more information
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community
if you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period
if you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible
if you have coronavirus symptoms:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
you do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home
testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home
plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home and consider what can be done for vulnerable people in the household
ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home
wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water, or use hand sanitiser
if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.
If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111.

NHS England and NHS Improvement
Publications approval reference: 001559
19 March 2020
This is the third of a series of regular updates to general practice regarding the
emerging COVID-19 situation. An electronic copy of this letter, and all other relevant
guidance from NHS England and NHS Improvement can be found here:
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
Dear GPs and their commissioners,
NEXT STEPS ON GENERAL PRACTICE RESPONSE TO COVID 19
We recognise the intense pressure that general practice is under right now as the
pandemic increases rapidly.
On 17 March you received Next Steps on the NHS response to COVID 19:
www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/publication/next-steps-on-nhs-response-to-covid-
19-letter-from-simon-stevens-and-amanda-pritchard/
This letter now describes the service delivery consequences for general practice and
further steps we are taking nationally to manage the workload consequences and
ensure that income can be protected if other routine work has to be substituted.
Supporting staff to stay safe and well at work is a critical immediate priority ,
including through expansion of testing, and supply of PPE. An issue of protective kit
commenced on 9 March 2020. If any general practice has concerns around th e kit,
please contact our National Supply Disruption line on 0800 915 9964 or email
supplydisruptionservice@nhsbsa.nhs.uk who will be available to help, Monday to
Friday 08:00-18:00.
1. Advice and guidance on coronavirus
Up-to-date advice from Public Health England, including the latest case definition,
can be found here and our latest guidance can be found here.
Anyone who is unwell should go to NHS111 online first for advice, rather than
approaching their GP practice. If a case comes to the surgery or extended hours
hub:
• If the patient is WELL then:
- they should go home immediately and self-isolate
- use nhs.uk/coronavirus for advice and guidance.
• If the patient is UNWELL then:
o use PPE as per current PHE guidance for possible cases
o isolate the patient
o if acutely unwell treat as appropriate
o if not then ask them to use NHS 111 online or ring NHS 111 from home
or the isolation room
o decontaminate as per the standard operating procedure (SOP).

2. Service implications and priorities
Responding to COVID-19 is already necessitating major immediate changes to how
general practice works.
Right now, all practices and their commissioners are asked to focus on six urgent
priorities:
1. Move to a total triage system (whether by phone or online). This does not
mean not advising/treating patients for other health issues, where there is
clinical need, or unilateral closing of practices doors, rather ensuring that
patients are appropriately triaged to the right health professional setting. The
upsurge in telephone calls to general practice means that providing a reliable
and timely response for patients has already become a vital operational
priority.
2. Agree locally with your CCG which practice premises and teams should
be used to manage essential face-to-face services.
3. Undertake all care that can be done remotely via appropriate channels,
guided by your clinical judgement. We ask you to read the guidance note at
annex A.
4. Prepare for the significant increase in home visiting as a result of social
distancing, home isolation and the need to discharge all patients who do not
need to be in hospital
5. Prioritise support for particular groups of patients at high risk. Next
week the NHS will be writing directly to all patients in this category, and you
will receive further advice shortly
6. Help staff to stay safe and at work, building cross-practice resilience
across primary care networks, and confirming business continuity plans.
To reduce the risk of respiratory disease, protect those most vulnerable and reduce
pressure on health services, please can you also ensure that you have ordered
sufficient stock of the recommended adult flu vaccines for 2020/21* to meet your
local needs before the 31st March 2020. In summary these are:
• For over-65s aTIV
• For under-65s at risk, including pregnancy women either QIVc or QIVe.
* www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NHS-England-JCVI-advce-and-
NHS-reimbursement-flu-vaccine-2020-21.pdf
3. Arrangements to free up capacity and protect income
We will seek to do all we can to support practices to manage inevitable increases in
workload at this extremely difficult time.
Patients will be clearly advised to visit
http://nhs.uk/coronavirus in the first instance and not to visit their practice, if they
have relevant symptoms.
The key principle is that we free up practice capacity to prioritise workload to both
prepare for and manage the COVID-19 outbreak. All routine CQC inspections have
http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NHS-England-JCVI-advce-and-NHS-reimbursement-flu-vaccine-2020-21.pdf
http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NHS-England-JCVI-advce-and-NHS-reimbursement-flu-vaccine-2020-21.pdf
been cancelled and advice is being issued on suspension of appraisal and
revalidation activities.
We ask all practices to consider stopping any private work they are doing to help free
up capacity.
We will make sure that funding does not influence clinical decision making by
ensuring that all GP practices in 2020/21 continue to be paid at rates that assume
that assume they would have continued to perform at the same levels from the
beginning of the outbreak as they had done previously, including for the purposes of
QOF, DES and LES payments.
This section:
• outlines the actions we are taking nationally now to support practices to free
up capacity – see table 1
• identifies activities that practices can suspend in the circumstances set out
where this is necessary to free up capacity to support the COVID-19 response
– see table 2. This may be added to or amended in due course as required
• recommends that commissioners suspend their locally commissioned
services, schemes and pilots unless these will directly support the response to
the Covid-19 outbreak – see table 3.
From the date of this letter until a new announcement is made, a practice is not
required to provide the activities set out in table (ii) where this is necessary as a
result of work generated by the COVID-19 response and where that would be
clinically appropriate as part of clinical prioritisation.
Commissioners are expected not to take remedial action under the contract in such
circumstances and swift changes to Regulations are expected to give statutory force
to this position. We will update practices once these Regulations come into force.
4. Further communications
We will continue to send regular updates, hold regular webinars and share
information as the situation unfolds. On Thursday 11th March we held two webinars.
The first discussed the move from the contain to delay phases, and support in place
for colleagues and patients. The second discussed how to use remote triaging and
online consultations in managing COVID-19. Although more than 1,000 people
attended each webinar, we recognise that not everyone who wanted to attend would
have been able to. They will be uploaded to our website on this page:
www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
http://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
The next webinar will be held today (Thursday 19 March), at 5pm. To join either:
Call one of the dial-in numbers before the start time (0800 121 4113 or 01296 480

Table 1: Actions we are taking nationally to free up capacity in general practice
Activity Update
1 QOF for 2019/20
QOF activity for 2019/20 is
largely complete and QOF
calculations will be made
as usual.
However, given the priority
that may need to be given
to COVID-19 work, we will
undertake a piece of
analysis to confirm the
impact and will make a
one-off adjustment for
practices who earned less
in 2019/20 than 2018/19
as a result of COVID-19
activities.
2 QOF for 2020/21 We will protect QOF
income as necessary to
respond to COVID-19.
3 Dispensary Services
Quality Scheme (DSQS)
payments
For dispensing practices
only, the DSQS will be
suspended with immediate
effect, with income
protected. This includes
ceasing DRUMs with
immediate effect.
Medication review should
continue if essential.
4 Investment and Impact
Fund (IIF)
We will defer the
introduction of an incentive
scheme for at least the first
half of 2020/21. Investment
for the first two quarters of
2020/21 will not be lost to
PCNs.
5 Network Contract DES
service requirements
The funding attached to
the PCN DES in 20/21 will
continue to be available to
practices signing up. The
introduction of the
Structured Medication
Review and Medicines
Optimisation Service
Specification will be
postponed, in the first
instance until October
2020.
Networks should make
every possible effort, to
begin work on the early
Cancer Diagnosis
specification as planned,
unless work to support the
COVID-19 response
intervenes.
People who are concerned
about any symptoms
related to suspected
cancer should still contact
their GP and GPs should
make sure they continue to
refer those for suspected
cancer for diagnostic tests
as normal.
Given the importance of
delivering a coordinated
service to care homes, the
Enhanced Health in Care
Homes service
requirements will continue
in line with the dates set
out in the 2020/21 GP
contract deal, and we will
ensure alignment with
COVID-19 pathways.
6 Network Contract DES:
workforce returns
The additional workforce
under the ARRS will be
critical to the COVID-19
response. However, we
recognise that PCNs may
need more time to
consider their workforce
needs.
We will therefore delay the
deadlines for the workforce
planning templates from 30
June to 31 August 2020,
and the associated
requirements on CCGs to
redistribute unused
https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/update-to-the-gp-contract-agreement-v2-updated.pdf
https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/update-to-the-gp-contract-agreement-v2-updated.pdf
additional roles funding to
other PCNs until the end of
September 2020.
7 Appraisals and revalidation We strongly recommend
that appraisals are
suspended, unless there
are exceptional
circumstances agreed by
both the appraisee and
appraiser.
This should
immediately increase
capacity in our workforce
by allowing appraisers to
return to clinical practice.
Until reinstated,
responsible officers should
classify appraisals which
are affected as ‘approved
missed’ appraisals.
For
clarity, affected appraisals
will be regarded as
cancelled, not postponed.
Separate advice on
revalidation is being
issued.
In the meantime, for those
doctors where appraisal
has been cancelled and a
recommendation is due,
responsible officers are
reminded that they may
make a positive
recommendation if the
required supporting
information has otherwise
been presented earlier in
the doctor’s revalidation
cycle.
At the same time, if
needed, doctors can be
reassured that deferral is a
neutral act and has no
impact on their ability to
practice as normal.
8 Scale down of CQC
inspections
CQC has announced that
from 16th March routine
inspections will be
suspended.
Table 2: Further activities practices may wish to consider suspending if
necessary to free up capacity for COVID-19 response
Activity Recommendation
9 New patient reviews
(including alcohol
dependency)
Practices may wish to
suspend the offer of a
consultation within six
months to new patients
joining the practice list
(including alcohol
dependency screening).
Using their clinical
judgement, contractors
may cancel consultations
which have been offered
but not yet taken up.
Where, in their clinical
judgement, the contractor
considers a patient to be
high risk and should
receive a consultation, it
should be undertaken
remotely or in exceptional
cases by home visit.
10 Over-75 health checks Where a patient who is
over 75 and who has not
had a consultation in the
previous 12 months, they
may request one for a
health check as per the
GMS contract. Contractors
may, using their clinical
judgement, not provide
that consultation if in their
judgement that is not the
right priority. They must, if
they consider it clinically
necessary for the patient to
have a consultation for any
reason, including in
relation to COVID-19,
continue to deliver that via
the appropriate channel.
11 Annual patient reviews,
including under QOF
These can be deferred if
necessary (possibly to
recommence from
October) unless they can
be viably conducted
remotely and/or in
exceptional cases in
person or by home visit as
per local clinical discretion.
12 Routine medication
reviews
These can be deferred if
necessary (possibly to
recommence from
October) unless they can
be viably conducted
remotely and/or in
exceptional cases in
person or by home visit as
per local clinical discretion.
Key medication reviews
should continue where a
patient is being regularly
monitored.
13 Clinical reviews of frailty These can be deferred
(possibly to recommence
from October) including
medication review, patient
discussion, potential
medical interventions and
recording of those
interventions for patients
over 65 living with severe
frailty. Where, in the
contractor’s clin ical
judgement, such a review
is necessary they should
be conducted remotely
and/or in exceptional
cases in person or by
home visit as per local
clinical discretion.
14 Friends and Family Test
(FFT)
Practices will not be
required to report to
commissioners about FFT
results.
15 Engagement with and
review of feedback from
Practices can suspend
engaging with and / or
reviewing feedback from
Patient Participation
Groups (PPG)
their PPG, and may pause
implementing any
improvements previously
agreed between the
practice and the PPG
unless, in the contractor’s
opinion, those are clinically
necessary. Consideration
should also be given to
stopping any similar local
activity that might involve
gatherings of potentially
vulnerable patients.
16
Dispensing list cleansing
For dispensing practices,
dispensing patient list
cleansing exercises can be
deferred (possibly to
recommence from
October) until these
measures have been
formally rescinded.
17 PCN clinical director PCN Clinical Directors may
delegate many of their
functions to a non-clinician
where appropriate. The
Core PCN Funding
(£1.50/head) and Clinical
Director funding may both
be used to secure
additional non-clinical
support to the Clinical
Director and to support the
COVID-19 response.
Table 3: Services and activities we are recommending local commissioners
consider suspending
Activity Recommendation
18 LESs/LISs and local and
national pilots
Unless commissioned
services are considered to
support the national
COVID-19 response,
LES/LISs, local pilots,
regional or nationally
commissioned pilots
should cease, based on
local discretion. Funding,
particularly to support
staffing, should be
maintained and re-directed
to the primary medical care
COVID-19 response.
Given the importance of
care homes services to the
COVID-19 response, and
the continued
implementation of the
Enhanced Health in Care
Homes service through the
Network Contract DES,
commissioners should not
decommission local care
homes services until the
requirements in the DES
come into effect, and
should ensure a carefully
managed transition from
local to national
requirements.
19 Local audit and local
assurance activities
Unless considered to
support the national
COVID-19 response the
default should be to cease
or reduce frequency.
20 Other local data collections
Unless considered to
support the national
COVID-19 response the
default should be to cease
or decrease frequency.
Where a practice provides services under local arrangements set out in table iii
above, the practice must confirm the position with the relevant local commissioner
before suspending any activity.
.
Annex A
Digital primary care and COVID-19
The following sets out practical steps to support GP practices with remote triage and
remote management of patients to:
• Enable and use a triage first model at the point of access by patients to
general practice.
• Enable the public to receive advice and care without attending practices in
person, unless in-person care is clinically required.
• Use telephone, video and online consultation technology to support triage and
remote management of patients.
Specifically, commissioners, PCNs and practices should be taking the following
actions:
• All practices should move to a triage first model as rapidly as possible to
protect patients and staff from possible infection.
• To support a triage first model, practices and commissioners should either
promote online consultation services where they are in place or rapidly
procure online consultation services. Rapid procurement for those practices
that do not currently have an online consultation solution will be supported
through a national bundled procurement. This will be available within the next
14 days and will be accessed by commissioners on behalf of practices.
Commissioners should approach our regional teams for more information on
this process.
• Triage may be delivered by telephone but practices should also promote
online consultation and introduce an online consultation service where they
don’t already have it. Telephone access should be maintained to ensure
services are available to those patients where there are barriers to digital
access.
• Practices should manage patients remotely unless in-person care is clinically
required, in order to minimise infection risk.
• Current pre-booked appointments should be carried out remotely unless in -
person care is clinically required.
• Video consultations should be used for remote management where
possible. Options are being developed nationally to enable roll out of video
consultation capability to all practices as soon as possible.
• To support a triage first model, online appointments that are pre-bookable by
patients should be converted to remote triage appointments (as per previous
guidance) OR turned off where online pre-bookable appointments are not
part of the triage process (for example if all triage is handled through an online
consultation system).
• The contractual commitment requiring 25% of appointments to be available
online does not apply to practices that have implemented a triage first model.
• Practices must not turn off other patient-facing digital services, ie repeat
prescription ordering and patient access to medical records. These services
should still be available to patients via the NHS App and other tools. If this
functionality has been switched off, it should be switched back on.
• Practices should retain appointments for 111 to directly book on behalf of
patients who have been through 111 triage, but should offer these as
telephone/video appointments unless in-person care is clinically necessary.
• Practices should enable record sharing across PCNs (as a minimum), where
this is not already in place.
• Patients should be strongly encouraged to use online services for repeat
prescription ordering.
• Practices must use the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) and should aim
to move patients to electronic repeat dispensing unless there is a clinical
reason not to do so. There should be no move to increase the duration of
prescriptions.
Some guidance or resources have been linked to above. Additional guidance and
resources on all these points will be rapidly developed for commissioners and
practices and will be made available on the our primary care coronavirus web pages
and on the Digital Primary Care Future NHS Site.
Commissioners should be identifying and reprioritising implementation resources in
their area to support practices and PCNs in delivering the above. Where there are
gaps and issues these should be discussed with NHS England and NHS
Improvement Regional Teams.
We recognise the importance of explaining these changes to patients and have
developed the following message for patients to support this, to be used as needed.
To reduce your chances of catching COVID-19 and reduce pressure on your
local GP practice during this busy time, appointments will be carried out over
the phone or through (ADD OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE) unless there is a
clinical need for you to come into the practice.
This will help minimise risk
while continuing to ensure people get the care and advice they need.
NHSx Digital Primary Care – text messaging and remote working advice for
Practices
SMS messaging
At this time, practices will need to be able to send messages to patients in much
greater volume than normal.
Most areas already have unlimited SMS plans. For
those that don’t and need additional credits for SMS messaging, they should urgently
secure the additional capacity through their local commissioning groups.
If your
CCG needs additional funding to cover this, please ask that they contact
pcdt@nhsx.nhs.uk.

mailto:pcdt@nhsx.nhs.uk
Remote working - laptops
GP practice staff will increasingly need to work from home or in settings outside the
practice. Some areas have already deployed laptops or other forms of remote
working for practice staff.
Where this has not happened and where additional
equipment is urgently needed, local commissioners will provision the equipment and
support services.
If local commissioners are unable to respond either through lack of
equipment or funding or both, we will support them nationally.
Please note that any
equipment used for access to clinical systems must conform with Securing
Excellence in Primary Care: The Primary Care (GP ) Digital Services Operating
Model 2020-21 standards.. A minimum specification and guidance for any laptop
devices procured for emergency purposes can be found at the end of this section.
Smartcards
Smartcards will be needed for certain functions in clinical systems such as electronic
prescription service and electronic referral service.
Smartcards are provided through
local commissioners who should be able to respond to your needs.
If that isn’t
happening, please contact pcdt@nhsx.nhs.uk..
Remote working – Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
NHSX has provided advice on staff using their own devices for access to NHS
systems during this period.
If your Data Protection Officer or Caldicott Guardian is unsure of appropriate action
to take, you can direct Information Governance questions to the NHSX IG Policy
team. If local commissioners are unable to respond either through lack of equipment
or funding or both, we will support them nationally, please ask that they contact
pcdt@nhsx.nhs.uk..
Telephony
If practices don’t have enough telephone capacity to deal with inbound calls from
patients and outbound calls from practices, please let us know as we are looking to
understand the extent of additional funding that might be required.
Headsets
Headsets are likely to be required to support telephone and video consultation.
Please advise if you need additional equipment and we will advise arrangements for
funding.
If you need more advice, please contact:
pcdt@nhsx.nhs.uk.
Please note we will be working with regional offices and CCGs to ensure they are
able to meet these requirements.
Remote working
The most appropriate method of connection is via a HSCN VPN token which will
provide connectivity to the clinical application, we are stipulating the provision of
smart card readers to enable spine connected services to function. Further

Data Security and Protection Toolkit Submission 2019/20
It is critically important that we remain resilient to cyber attacks during this period of
COVID-19 response. The Data Security & Protection Toolkit (DSPT) helps
organisations check they are in a good position to do that. Most organisations will
already have completed, or be near completion of, their DSPT return for 2019/20.
However, in light of events, NHSX recognises that it will be difficult for many
organisations to fully complete the toolkit without impacting on their COVID-19
response.
NHSX has therefore taken the decision to push back the final deadline for
DSPT submissions to 30 June 2020.
Organisations can choose to complete DSPT
before that date. If they do so, and if they fully meet the standard, those
organisations will be awarded 'Standards Met' status, as in previous years.
Where organisations have separate agreements with commissioners or in formation
sharing partners, the existing deadline remains unchanged unless agreed between
relevant parties.
Whilst the DSPT submission deadline is being relaxed to account for COVID-19, the
cyber security risk remains high.
All organisations must continue to maintain their
patching regimes. Trusts, CSUs and CCGs must continue to comply with the strict
48hr and 14 day requirements in relation to acknowledgment of, and mitigation for,
any High Severity Alerts issued by NHS Digital (allowing for frontline service
continuity).
This message will be made available on the news page of the news page of the Data
Security and Protection Toolkit.
Further advice for organisations completing their Data Security and Protection
Toolkit assessment is available from www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Home/Contact
Temporary lifting of restrictions for GP retainers who wish to opt in for
additional sessions
We recognise that some retained GPs may wish to support efforts to ease the
challenges primary care may face in relation to COVID-19. NHS England and NHS
Improvement is temporarily lifting the restrictions on the maximum number of day
time in hours sessions GPs currently supported by the National GP Retention
Scheme may conduct, provided the following two conditions are met:
1. Retained GPs’ increased participation is voluntary.
2. Retained GPs have access to their existing level of support including in
supervision during this period and that their needs are reviewed regularly.
Retained GPs, who wish to increase their sessional commitment above their agreed
number under the GP Retention Scheme, should notify their CCG via the local HEE
scheme lead of their intention.
Retained GPs and their employing practice will continue to receive the financial
support in line with their existing agreement. Any additional sessions retained
GPs choose to undertake during this temporary lift will not attract additional
scheme payments.
This position is effective immediately and for one calendar month in the first instance
(until 10 April 2020). The position will be reassessed regularly and is subject to
change.
Offer of PPV vaccine in response to COVID-19
We ask that where feasible and where vaccine stock is available, that you continue
seeking to identify and offer Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (PPV23) to
those eligible.
Given recent vaccine constraints, we recognise that PPV23 can be
https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/News
https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/News
http://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Home/Contact
offered at any time in the year to those most at risk including those aged 2 years and
over in clinical risk groups in the first instance. Public Health England has issued
guidance on those requiring prioritisation where vaccine is constrained please see

Dear Colleague,
IMPORTANT AND URGENT – NEXT STEPS ON NHS RESPONSE TO COVID-19
Thank you for your extensive work to date to prepare for this rapidly increasing
pandemic, following the NHS declaration of a Level 4 National Incident on 30
January.
Last night the Government announced additional measures to seek to reduce the
spread across the country. It is essential these measures succeed. However as the
outbreak intensifies over the coming days and weeks, the evidence from other
countries and the advice from SAGE and the Chief Medical Officer is that at the peak
of the outbreak the NHS will still come under intense pressure.
This letter therefore sets out important actions we are now asking every part of the
NHS to put in place to redirect staff and resources, building on multiple actions
already in train. These will:
• Free-up the maximum possible inpatient and critical care capacity.
• Prepare for, and respond to, the anticipated large numbers of COVID-19
patients who will need respiratory support.
• Support staff, and maximise their availability.

• Play our part in the wider population measures newly announced by
Government.
• Stress-test operational readiness.
• Remove routine burdens, so as to facilitate the above.
Please therefore now enact the following measures:
1. Free-up the maximum possible inpatient and critical care capacity
The operational aim is to expand critical care capacity to the maximum; free up
30,000 (or more) of the English NHS’s 100,000 general and acute beds from the
actions identified in a) and b) below; and supplement them with all available
additional capacity as per c) below. To that end, trusts are asked now to:
a) Assume that you will need to postpone all non-urgent elective operations from
15th April at the latest, for a period of at least three months. However you also
have full local discretion to wind down elective activity over the next 30 days
as you see best, so as to free up staff for refresher training, beds for COVID
patients, and theatres/recovery facilities for adaptation work. Emergency
admissions, cancer treatment and other clinically urgent care should continue
unaffected. In the interim, providers should continue to use all available
capacity for elective operations including the independent sector, before
COVID constraints curtail such work. This could free up 12,000-15,000
hospital beds across England.
b) Urgently discharge all hospital inpatients who are medically fit to leave.
Community health providers must take immediate full responsibility for urgent
discharge of all eligible patients identified by acute providers on a discharge
list. For those needing social care, emergency legislation before Parliament
this week will ensure that eligibility assessments do not delay discharge. New
government funding for these discharge packages and to support the supply
and resilience of out-of-hospital care more broadly is being made available.
(See section 6f of this letter). Trusts and CCGs will need to work with local
authority partners to ensure that additional capacity is appropriately
commissioned. This could potentially free up to 15,000 acute beds currently
occupied by patients awaiting discharge or with lengths of stay over 21 days.
c) Nationally we are now in the process of block-buying capacity in independent
hospitals. This should be completed within a fortnight. Their staff and facilities
will then be flexibly available to you for urgent surgery, as well as for
repurposing their beds, operating theatres and recovery facilities to provide
respiratory support for COVID-19 patients. As soon as we have the detailed
capacity map of what will be available in each part of the country we will share
that with you via Regional Directors. NHS trusts and foundation trusts should
3
free up their own private pay beds where they exist. In addition, community
health providers and social care providers are asked to free up community
hospital and intermediate care beds that could be used flexibly within the next
fortnight. These measures together could free up to 10,000 beds.
2. Prepare for, and respond to, large numbers of inpatients requiring
respiratory support
Emerging international and UK data on COVID-19 patients suggests that a
significant proportion who are hospitalised require respiratory support, particularly
mechanical ventilation and to a lesser extent non-invasive ventilation.
a) Work is well in hand nationally to secure a step change in oxygen supply and
distribution to hospitals. Locally, hospital estates teams have now reported on
their internal oxygen piping, pumping and bedside availability. All trusts able
to enhance these capabilities across their estate are asked to do so
immediately, and you will be fully reimbursed accordingly. The goal is to have
as many beds, critical care bays, theatre and recovery areas able to
administer oxygen as possible.
b) National procurement for assisted respiratory support capacity, particularly
mechanical ventilation, is also well under way in conjunction with the
Department of Health and Social Care. In addition, the Government is working
with the manufacturing sector to bring new manufacturers online. These
devices will be made available to the NHS across England, Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland according to need. Mark Brandreth, chief executive of
Agnes Jones and Robert Hunt foundation trust is now supporting this work.
c) In respect of PPE, the DHSC procurement team reports that nationally there
is currently adequate national supply in line with PHE recommended usage,
and the pandemic influenza stockpile has now been released to us. However
locally distribution issues are being reported. Michael Wilson, chief executive
of SASH, is now helping resolve this on behalf of the NHS. In addition if you
experience problems there is now a dedicated line for you: 0800 915 9964 /
0191 283 6543 / Email: supplydisruptionservice@nhsbsa.nhs.uk.
d) A far wider range of staff than usual will be involved in directly supporting
patients with respiratory needs. Refresher training for all clinical and patient-
facing staff must therefore be provided within the next fortnight. A cross-
specialty clinical group supported by the Royal Colleges is producing
guidance to ensure learning from experience here and abroad is rapidly
shared across the UK. This will include: a short education package for the
entire NHS workforce; a service guide, including for anaesthetics and critical
care; COVID-19 clinical management guides in collaboration with NICE.
mailto:supplydisruptionservice@nhsbsa.nhs.uk

e) Segregate all patients with respiratory problems (including presumed COVID-
19 patients). Segregation should initially be between those with respiratory
illness and other cases. Then once test results are known, positive cases
should be cohort-nursed in bays or wards.
f) Mental Health, Learning Disability and Autism providers must plan for COVID-
19 patients at all inpatient settings. You need to identify areas where COVID-
19 patients requiring urgent admission could be most effectively isolated and
cared for (for example single rooms, ensuite, or mental health wards on acute
sites). Case by case reviews will be required where any patient is unable to
follow advice on containment and isolation. Staff should undergo refresher
training on physical health care, vital signs and the deteriorating patient, so
they are clear about triggers for transfer to acute inpatient care if indicated.
3. Support our staff, and maximise staff availability
a) The NHS will support staff to stay well and at work. Please ensure you have
enhanced health and wellbeing support for our frontline staff at what is going
to be a very difficult time.
b) As extra coronavirus testing capability comes on line we are also asking
Public Health England as a matter of urgency to establish NHS targeted staff
testing for symptomatic staff who would otherwise need to self-isolate for 7
days. For those staff affected by PHE’s 14 day household isolation policy,
staff should - on an entirely voluntary basis - be offered the alternative option
of staying in NHS-reimbursed hotel accommodation while they continue to
work. Sarah-Jane Marsh, chief executive of Birmingham Women’s and
Children’s foundation trust is now supporting this work.
c) For staff members at increased risk according to PHE’s guidance (including
pregnant women), if necessary, NHS organisations should make adjustments
to enable staff to stay well and at work wherever possible. Adjustments may
include working remotely or moving to a lower risk area. Further guidance will
be made available and the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology will
provide further guidance about pregnant women.
d) For otherwise healthy staff who are at higher risk of severe illness from
COVID-19 required by PHE’s guidance to work from home, please consider
how they can support the provision of telephone-based or digital / video-
based consultations and advice for outpatients, 111, and primary care. For
non-clinical staff, please consider how they can continue to contribute
remotely. Further guidance will be made available
5
e) The GMC, NMC and other professional regulators are also writing to clinicians
who have relinquished their licence to practice within the past three years to
see whether they would be willing to return to help in some capacity.
f) Urgent work is also underway led by chief nursing officer Ruth May, NHS
chief people officer Prerana Issar and Health Education England, the relevant
regulators and universities to deploy medical and nursing students, and
clinical academics. They are finalising this scheme in the next week.
g) All appropriate registered Nurses, Midwives and AHP’s currently in non-
patient facing roles will be asked to support direct clinical practice in the NHS
in the next few weeks, following appropriate local induction and support.
Clinically qualified staff at NHSE/I are now being redeployed to frontline
clinical practice.
h) The four UK chief medical officers, the national medical director, the Academy
of Medical Royal Colleges and the GMC have written to all UK doctors
stressing that it will be appropriate and necessary for clinicians to work
beyond their usual disciplinary boundaries and specialisms under these
difficult circumstances, and they will support individuals who do so. (see
https://www.aomrc.org.uk/wp-
content/uploads/2020/03/0320_letter_supporting_doctors_in_COVID-19.pdf )
Equivalent considerations apply for nurses, AHPs and other registered health
professionals.
4. Support the wider population measures newly announced by Government
Measures announced last night are detailed at:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-
and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-
protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults
a) Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) and local
authorities in conjunction with their Local Resilience Forums (LRFs) have lead
responsibility for overseeing support for older and vulnerable people who are
going to be ‘shielded’ at home over the coming months. Community health
services and voluntary organisations should engage with LRFs on how best to
do this.
b) A number of these individuals would be expected to have routine or urgent
GP, diagnostic or outpatient appointments over the coming months. Providers
should roll out remote consultations using video, telephone, email and text
message services for this group as a priority and extend to cover all important
routine activity as soon as possible, amongst others. David Probert, chief

executive of Moorfields foundation trust, is now leading a taskforce to support
acute providers rapidly stand up these capabilities, with NHSX leading on
primary care. Face-to-face appointments should only take place when
absolutely necessary.
c) For patients in the highest risk groups, the NHS will be identifying and
contacting them over the coming week. They are likely to need enhanced
support from their general practices, with whom they are by definition already
in regular contact. GP services should agree locally which sites should
manage essential face-to-face assessments. Further advice on this is being
developed jointly with PHE and will be available this week.
d) As part of the overall ‘social distancing’ strategy to protect staff and patients,
the public should be asked to greatly limit visitors to patients, and to consider
other ways of keeping in touch such as phone calls.
5. Stress-test your operational readiness
a) All providers should check their business continuity plans and review the
latest guidance and standard operating procedures (SOP), which can be
found at www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/.
b) Trust Incident Management Teams – which must now be in place in all
organisations - should receive and cascade guidance and information,
including CAS Alerts. It is critical that we have accurate response to data
requests and daily sitrep data to track the spread of the virus and our
collective response, so please ensure you have sufficient administrative
capacity allocated to support these tasks.
c) For urgent patient safety communications, primary care providers will be
contacted through the Central Alerting System (CAS). Please register to
receive CAS alerts directly from the MHRA:
https://www.cas.mhra.gov.uk/Register.aspx.
d) This week we are undertaking a system-wide stress-testing exercise which
you are asked to participate in. It takes the form of a series of short sessions
spread over four days from today. Each day will represent a consecutive week
in the response to the outbreak, starting at ‘week six’ into the modelled
epidemic. We would strongly encourage all Hospital Incident Management
Teams with wider system engagement (including with primary care and local
government representation) to take part.

6. Remove routine burdens
To free you up to devote maximum operational effort to COVID readiness and
response, we are now taking the following steps nationally:
a) Cancelling all routine CQC inspections, effective immediately.
b) Working with Government to ensure that the emergency legislation being
introduced in Parliament this week provides us with wide staffing and
regulatory flexibility as it pertains to the health and social care sector.
c) Reviewing and where appropriate temporarily suspending certain
requirements on GP practices and community pharmacists. Income will be
protected if other routine contracted work has to be substituted. We will issue
guidance on this, which will also cover other parts of the NHS.
d) Deferring publication of the NHS People Plan and the Clinical Review of
Standards recommendations to later this year. Deferring publication of the
NHS Long Term Plan Implementation Framework to the Autumn, and
recommending you do the same for your local plans.
e) Moving to block contract payments ‘on account’ for all NHS trusts and
foundation trusts for an initial period of 1 April to 31 July 2020, with
suspension of the usual PBR national tariff payment architecture and
associated administrative/ transactional processes.
f) Additional funding to cover your extra costs of responding to the coronavirus
emergency. Specific financial guidance on how to estimate, report against,
and be reimbursed for these costs is being issued this week. The Chancellor
of the Exchequer committed in Parliament last week that “Whatever extra
resources our NHS needs to cope with coronavirus – it will get.” So financial
constraints must not and will not stand in the way of taking immediate and
necessary action - whether in terms of staffing, facilities adaptation,
equipment, patient discharge packages, staff training, elective care, or any
other relevant category.
COVID-19 presents the NHS with arguably the greatest challenge it has faced since
its creation. Our health service - through our skilled and dedicated staff - is renowned
for the professional, flexible and resilient way that it responds to adversity. Please
accept our sincere thanks for your leadership, and that of your staff, in what is going
to be a highly challenging period.
This is a time when the entire NHS will benefit from pulling together in a nationally
coordinated effort. But this is going to be a fast-moving situation requiring agile
8
responses. If there are things you spot that you think we all should be doing
differently, please let us know personally. And within the national framework, do also
use your discretion to do the right thing in your particular circumstances. You will
have our backing in doing so.
With best wishes,
Sir Simon Stevens

ANNEX: CORONAVIRUS COST REIMBURSEMENT
This guidance sets out the amended financial arrangements for the NHS for the period
between 1 April and 31 July. These changes will enable the NHS and partner
organisations (including Local Authorities and the Independent Sector) to respond to
COVID-19. We will continue to revise this guidance to reflect operational changes and
feedback from the service as the response develops.
We will shortly be making a payment on account to all acute and ambulance providers
to cover the costs of COVID-19-related work done so far this year, with final costs for
the current financial year being confirmed as part of the year end processes. This initial
payment will be based on information already submitted by providers. Future
payments will be based on further cost submissions.
All NHS providers and commissioners must carefully record the costs incurred in
responding to the outbreak and will be required to report actual costs incurred on a
monthly basis. Accurate record keeping during this time is crucial - record keeping
must meet the requirements of external audit, and public and Parliamentary scrutiny.
To support reimbursement and track expenditure we will in due course be asking all
relevant organisations to provide best estimates of expected costs from now until the
expected end of the peak outbreak. We will provide further guidance with relevant
assumptions in order to support you in making these estimates.
REVENUE COSTS
Contractual payments and provider reimbursement
We are suspending the operational planning process for 2020/21.
We will provide all NHS providers a guaranteed minimum level of income reflecting
the current cost base on the following basis:
a) Commissioners should agree block contracts with the NHS providers with
whom they have a contract (NHS Trusts, Foundation Trusts, Mental Health,
Community and Ambulance trusts) to cover the period 1 April to 31 July. This
should provide a guaranteed monthly payment. For CCGs the value of this
payment will be calculated nationally for each CCG/provider relationship. This
figure will be based on the average monthly expenditure implied by the
provider figures in the M9 Agreement of Balances return plus an uplift that
allows for the impact of inflation (including pay uplifts and CNST) but
excluding the tariff efficiency factor. It will not include activity growth. For
mental health trusts the uplift will include an additional sum consistent with
10
delivering the Mental Health Investment Standard. The monthly payment
should include CQUIN and assume 100% delivery.
b) Trusts should suspend invoicing for non-contracted activity for the period 1
April to 31 July. A sum equivalent to the historical monthly average will be
added to the block contract of the provider’s coordinating commissioner.
Providers should continue to record all activity including NCAs in SUS in the
normal way.
c) A national top-up payment will be provided to providers to reflect the difference
between the actual costs and income guaranteed by steps 1 and 2 where the
expected cost base (which will be calculated as the average monthly
expenditure over the period November to January uplifted for inflation) is higher.
The Financial Recovery Fund and associated rules will be suspended during
this period. The top-up payment will take into account individual provider CNST
contributions compared to that funded in the allowance for cost inflation.
We will provide these numbers to Commissioners and Providers on Monday 23 March.
Providers should claim for additional costs where the block payments do not equal
actual costs to reflect genuine and reasonable additional marginal costs due to
COVID-19. These reasonable costs should include:
a) Evidenced increases in staffing costs compared to the baseline period
associated with dealing with increased total activity.
b) Increases in temporary staffing to cover increased levels of sickness absence
or to deal with other caring responsibilities (e.g. to look after other family
members).
c) Payments for bank or sub-contractor staff to ensure all sickness absence is
covered consistent with Government’s announced policy and public health
advice which aren’t otherwise covered under normal practice; and
d) Additional costs of dealing with COVID-19 activity. For example: the costs of
running NHS111 assessment pods; increases in the volumes required or prices
of equipment to deal with the response to the virus which aren’t offset by
reductions elsewhere; extra costs of decontamination and transport for the
ambulance service; higher testing volumes in acute-based laboratories; and
community-based swabbing services.
Claims should be made on a monthly basis, alongside regular monthly financial
reports. This should provide sufficient funds for providers to deliver a break-even
11
position through the period and will provide the basis against which we will monitor
financial performance.
We will monitor the impact of any changes in income levels from non-NHS services,
in particular from local authorities. Providers should escalate to regional teams as
appropriate.
The payments made by commissioners under block contract arrangements should not
be revised to reflect any short falls in normal contractual performance during this
period. The majority of NHS acute providers are already exempt from the majority of
contract sanctions; for the duration of the outbreak until further notice any remaining
contract sanctions for all NHS provider groups are to be suspended.
It is important that providers and commissioners pay promptly during this time, so that
cash flow for NHS and non-NHS suppliers of goods and services does not become a
barrier to service provision.
The arrangements described above should mean there is minimal requirement for
interim working capital support during this period. Providers that believe they require
supplementary working capital support should follow the normal procedure to access
such support.
Funding for commissioners
Commissioner allocations for 2020/21 have already been notified as part of
operational planning and will not be changed. However, in assessing individual
commissioner financial positions and affordability we will take into account:
a) The impact of the block contracting approach set out above including both the
cost of removing the tariff efficiency factor and the benefit of excluding activity
growth from the calculation.
b) Expected reductions in investments for service developments
• the temporary arrangements for non-contracted activity, transferring
funding to make sure that lead commissioners have adequate funds to
pay providers; and
• the costs of additional service commitments as described below for
example for out of hours provision, additional NHS111 investment,
purchase of step-down beds and provision of rapid discharge/ additional
social care capacity.
c) We will also be reviewing planned transformation initiatives, and where we
consider that these will not be able to proceed during the coronavirus
emergency we will reflect this in the distribution of transformation funding.
12
d) In addition, a number of NHS commissioners are dependent on additional
central support to fully cover their expenditure. NHSE/I will calculate a central
top up payment on broadly the same basis as FRF to cover the difference
between allocations as set out above and expected costs.
Financial Governance
The maintenance of financial control and stewardship of public funds will remain
critical during the NHS response to COVID-19. Chief Executives, Accountable Officers
and Boards must continue to comply with their legal responsibilities and have regard
to their duties as set out in Managing Public Money and other related guidance. Any
financial mismanagement during this period will be dealt with in exactly the same way
as at any other time.
We recommend that NHS organisations undertake an urgent review of financial
governance to ensure decisions to commit resources in response to COVID-19 are
robust. Naturally, all organisations should test the resilience of their finance functions
and business continuity plans to make sure that the most important elements (running
payroll, paying suppliers, core reporting) can continue even with significant staff
absences. We are also asking you to consider the resilience of your fraud prevention
arrangements.
As normal financial arrangements have been suspended, no new revenue business
investments should be entered into unless related to Covid-19 or unless approved by
NHSE/I as consistent with a previously agreed plan. Where costs have already been
committed or contractual commitments entered into, providers should agree an
approach with NHSE/I as above.
Normal consultancy approval and agency reporting requirements must be maintained
during this period.
SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL FUNDING CONSIDERATIONS
Purchase of enhanced discharge support services
CCGs will be asked to work with their local authority partners to commission additional
out-of-hospital care and support capacity, in particular to facilitate step down of
patients from secondary care and so free up acute beds. These are expected to be a
blend of care home beds, hospices, and home-care support.
Detailed operational guidance for the procurement and management of these beds
will be issued separately including more detailed finance guidance. To make sure that
funding decisions do not restrict the pace of discharges, additional resources will be
provided to pay for the community bed or a package of care post-discharge for any
13
patient that needs it. New guidance will also ensure that eligibility assessments do not
delay new care packages being put in place. We will continue to review this approach
and will ask CCGs and local authorities to move to standard commissioning and
funding routes once the impact of Covid-19 sufficiently diminishes – you should plan
therefore on the basis of an average length of care package.
Additional funding will be provided based on monthly cost returns from CCGs.
Specialised services
As described above, Specialised Services contracts will follow the same principles as
CCG commissioned activity, and block values will be based on the average 2019/20
expenditure up to month 9, with an uplift to recognise the impact of pay uplifts and
other cost increases.
Arrangements for pass through Drugs and Devices costs will continue to operate as
currently on a cost and volume basis, to ensure that providers do not face any financial
consequences of any increases in activity or cost.
Specialised providers will be required to respond to the most serious cases of COVID-
19 through the provision of High Consequence Infectious Disease units,
Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation services and other specialised care functions.
Any specific investments and costs incurred by these units are being coordinated
through the National Highly Specialised team.
NHS 111
NHS 111 has been commissioned nationally to provide a dedicated Covid-19
response service. This service will continue to be contracted for and funded nationally.
In addition, having reviewed the pressures on the wider NHS 111 service additional
funding will be released from NHSE/I via lead commissioners, who will then make
necessary arrangements for payment to NHS 111 providers.
General Practice
The key principle is that from 1 April we free up practices to prioritise workload
according to what is necessary to prepare for and manage the outbreak, and therefore
guarantee that income will be protected if other routine contracted work has to be
substituted. This does not prevent us from continuing to measure activities (for
example those undertaken with QOF) but it ceases to put 2020/21 income at risk for
performance.
We will make sure that funding does not influence clinical decision making by ensuring
that all GP practices in 2020/21 continue to be paid at rates that assume they would
14
have continued to perform at the same levels from the beginning of the outbreak as
they had done previously, including for the purposes of QoF, DES and LES payments.
CCGs should plan to make payments on this basis. NHSE/I will reimburse any
additional costs as part of our wider finance agreement on Covid-19.
Out of Hours Provision
CCGs have been asked to procure additional GP out of hours provision in order to
provide home-based care for any patients that have tested positive for coronavirus in
the community. CCGs will be reimbursed for the additional costs incurred in delivering
this service through the allocations process. CCGs will be required to submit a monthly
return of additional cost incurred which will provide the basis of additional payments.
To keep the administrative burden to a minimum, where a CCG has contracted for this
service on behalf of itself and others, reimbursement will be directed through the lead
CCG.
Community Pharmacy
Where required, CCGs will be reimbursed for the following:
a) An NHS Urgent Medicines Supply Service for patients whose General Practice
is closed.
b) A Medicines Delivery Service to support Covid-19 positive and vulnerable
patients self-isolating at home.
c) Payments to contractors who are required to close due to Covid-19 related
reasons.
Optometry and dental
For the time being we expect that funding for dentistry and optometry will continue in
line with existing contractual arrangements using assumptions rolled over from
2019/20 where required. We will keep this under review and address any issues as
they arise.
Third and Independent Sector Providers
Details of reimbursement for any additional services to be procured from the third
sector or from independent sector organisations will be issued in due course.
15
CAPITAL COSTS
NHSE/I will shortly issue indicative capital allocations for 2020/21. Additional capital
expenditure will be required to support our response to the virus in a number of areas,
including purchase of pods, capital modifications to existing estate, purchasing of
ventilators and other medical equipment, and IT assets to enable smarter working
including remote consultations. In a number of cases NHSE/I may bulk-purchase
assets to secure the necessary resource as quickly as possible. However, this will not
always be practical or desirable, so below are the arrangements for providers and
commissioners to access capital in relation to the COVID-19 response. The key criteria
against which we will assess claims are:
a) The proposed expenditure must be clearly linked to delivery of our COVID-19
response;
NHS
b) In the case of asset purchases, the asset must be capable of being delivered
within the expected duration of the outbreak; and
c) In the case of modifications to estate, the works must be capable of being
completed within the expected duration of the outbreak.
Commissioner capital
We anticipate that individual claims for capital expenditure by commissioners will fall
within the delegated budgetary limits for NHSE/I of £10m. Any requests for capital
expenditure by commissioners including any assets being purchased on behalf of
general practice should be relayed to NHSE/I regional teams for assessment with the
national team, following which the required capital allocation will be issued.
Provider capital
We anticipate that individual claims for capital expenditure by providers will fall within
the delegated budgetary limits for trusts of £15m. Any requests for capital expenditure
by providers should be relayed to NHSE/I regional team for rapid assessment with the
national team to enable swift decision making and disbursement of cash where
appropriate. PDC charges will not be levied on any funding supplied in connection with
COVID-19.

Publications approval reference: 001559
20 March 2020
Dear HR colleague
Firstly, thank you for your continued commitment and work to support our people
through this unprecedented time.
In the last few days I have shared with you a number of communications to ensure
that you are fully sighted and kept informed of any new developments in our
response to COVID-19 and I am sincerely grateful for your ongoing support in this
unprecedented situation.
The health and wellbeing of our local communities and all colleagues working across
health and care is at the very centre of our collective efforts and attention and I know
we will continue to stand alongside our frontline colleagues and do everything in our
power to support them.
I appreciate that many of you are already resolving issues together locally and with
your ICS/STP leads and Regional Directors of Workforce & OD. I have heard of
some fantastic examples of local businesses reaching out directly to the NHS to offer
support and facilities, as well as joined up solutions with local authorities to support
childcare issues.
As we continue to work at pace with NHS Employers and our other partners, I
wanted to share with you some immediate updates:
Access to schools and childcare for children of ‘Key Workers’
The following definition has been provided by the Government for health and social
care:
This includes but is not limited to doctors, nurses, midwives, paramedics, social
workers, care workers, and other frontline health and social care staff including
volunteers; the support and specialist staff required to maintain the UK’s health and
social care sector; those working as part of the health and social care supply chain,
including producers and distributers of medicines and medical and personal
protective equipment.
This definition therefore includes all NHS staff and our colleagues in the partner
organisations who support the delivery of healthcare services. Both parents do not
have to be key workers to qualify for this support. We must remember that the
decision to close schools and nurseries has been made to limit the spread of
COVID-19, which means that if it is at all possible for children to be at home, then
they should be. The key worker exemption is designed to enable our NHS people to
be able to work and know that their children are being cared for.
We encourage members of staff with dependent children to contact their school or
childcare provider to establish what arrangements they and the local authority are
planning to have in place from Monday.
This is the link to the Department for Education’s website for full information and
please remember to regularly check as it is likely to be updated:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/closure-of-educational-settings-
information-for-parents-and-carers/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-
parents-and-carers
Key Worker – identification template letter
To help with NHS staff identification for the purposes of childcare and access to
supermarkets etc, we are expecting local valid photo security passes to be used. In
addition, we’ve attached at Annex 1 a template letter which may also support your
staff to confirm their status as a Key Worker. Many of you will already have
instigated this but the template is intended to be helpful if not done already.
Pay, terms and conditions for people returning to the NHS
In collaboration with the Department of Health and Social Care, Public Health
England, Health Education England and NHS Employers, and with input from the
NHS Staff Council Executive, latest pay, terms and conditions advice is being
collated into one central resource for workforce leaders in the NHS. The guidance I
hope will be issued early next week, once approved by Ministers.
ESR and recording absence
This is an urgent ask for your help and support so we can track and model
workforce data and make corresponding clinical and operational capacity
decisions about people needing urgent care.
It is vital that we are able to monitor all COVID-19 related absence and appreciate
the EPRR SitRep is an additional ask on top of normal absence-reporting
procedures, but currently, too little absence data is recorded if we are to stand this
element of the SitRep down. To enable all COVID-19 absence via ESR the following
is underway:
• Non-rostered staff: ESR has issued guidance (User Notices 2864 and 2868) on
this topic. Any type of absence can be recorded as ‘related’ to COVID-19,
whether that be special leave, self-isolation (recorded as Medical suspension with
pay) or actual sickness. You may have more detailed local arrangements but we
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers
ask that any absence recorded for non-rostered staff has the ‘related reason’ set
as COVID-19 for consistency.
• Rostered staff: we are working with a major e-rostering provider to have a
national COVID-19 code which will flow back into the appropriate field in ESR.
Please look for further communication from your e-rostering supplier about this.
Vulnerable staff groups
Attached at Annex 2 is a detailed note updating you on the definition of vulnerable
staff groups and the action that will be taken the week commencing 23 March. In
addition, there are specific actions every employer is being asked to take to support
their staff in high and at risk groups.
The NHS Employers website continues to be updated and I encourage you to keep
reviewing it: https://www.nhsemployers.org/covid19
Looking after staff right across the NHS remains a top priority, and that includes you.
Please keep sharing your insights and experiences with each other and with me.
There is an incredible wealth of experience and expertise in our professional
community and together we can make a difference for all our NHS staff at this critical
time.
Best wishes
Prerana Issar

Details
This guidance is intended for:
people with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, and do not require hospital treatment, who must remain at home until they are well
those living in households with someone who shows symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus
The main messages are:
if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. See ending isolation section for more information
if you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill
for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14-day isolation period. See ending isolation section for more information
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community
if you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period
if you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible
if you have coronavirus symptoms:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
you do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home
testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home
plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home and consider what can be done for vulnerable people in the household
ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home
wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water, or use hand sanitiser
if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.
If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111.

NHS England and NHS Improvement
19 March 2020
Dear HR colleagues
I wanted to write to you to acknowledge and thank you for all the work you are doing
to support the NHS response to COVID-19. The health and wellbeing of our local
communities and all colleagues working across heath and care is at the very centre
of all of our efforts and attention. We are aware that COVID19- is now an established
significant epidemic in the UK and the NHS is under extreme pressure. This
pressure will inevitably be exacerbated by staff shortages due to sickness or caring
responsibilities. It will be a challenge for all of us.
To alleviate some of this pressure, we are working with Public Health England who
are due to publish guidance for healthcare workers imminently. In addition, we are
putting in place arrangements for NHS staff to access hotel accommodation through
a national procurement programme and for local deployment. I will forward further
details on these arrangements soon.
I recognise of course that the COVID-19 pandemic will require significant workforce
flexibility and redirection of some resources for the benefit of the patients and
colleagues working under significant pressure. It may also be necessary to depart
from established procedures in order to mitigate risks and redeploy people to the
areas requiring more support. So I would like to reassure you that we are working at
pace with NHS Employers to share some very practical guidance for all HRDs which
will support in speeding up some HR processes and fill in any gaps. The aim is to
publish this guidance this week.
I also appreciate that some of the processes national bodies have in place and
require employers to respond in the workforce space may need to be temporarily
suspended or postponed. I will therefore be asking the HR network chairs group to
advise on what would be helpful in this respect.
Increasing pressure on our healthcare system could cause significant stress and you
may have concerns about health and wellbeing of people. As you know, there is
evidence that some staff will need additional support months or even years after a
particularly traumatic or stressful event.
we are developing a national framework
where employers will be able to access psychological support for a period of time
during and after the COVID-19 virus outbreak.
The model would be evidence based
in line with the presenting condition and we would be recommending treatment in
line with NICE guidelines specific to psychological trauma. You will of course be kept
informed of further developments.
Furthermore, in recognition of the current pressures on our services, we have
deferred the publication of the full NHS People Plan, along with other national
planning priorities. However, given the evolving situation, this timeline will be kept
under review with the government.
As ever, I would like to thank you for your relentless great work and continued
energy and support, particularly throughout these very challenging times.
Best wishes

Annex 2
Supporting our most vulnerable people
Preserving and protecting the health, safety and wellbeing of staff and keeping them
well is critical for the NHS as we respond to the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19). It
is essential that NHS organisations take every effort to support the physical and
mental wellbeing of our people to enable them to stay healthy and protect
themselves, colleagues, patients and families as we continue to deliver services
through this challenging period.
All NHS staff should be provided with supportive self-care advice in this period,
encouraged to rest, take any regular and prescribed medication and to look after
themselves and their teams.
Staff with comorbidity and those in higher risk groups
The Government is actively reviewing the advice to protect those people who are at
significantly increased risk from COVID-19 due to underlying health conditions. The
staff groupings can be seen at point 1 below. The national guidance should be
referenced and applied to staff who are in these groups.
Comorbidity is a medical term that is applied when individuals have multiple health
conditions that co-exist.
People with comorbidity are more likely to develop complications with their health.
Viruses can make chronic health problems worse and high risk groups may
experience a worsening of their conditions.
1) Staff in the very high risk groups
The NHS in England will now be directly contacting individuals who are deemed to
be high risk to recommend that they take more stringent measures to protect
themselves due to specific clinical conditions. The emphasis will be on both
protecting individuals and redeploying any staff who need to be into services, such
as 111, ambulance dispatch, virtual patient consultations. Individuals will be
contacted by the NHS Business Services Authority, GP practice or specialist, week
commencing 23 March and they will provide detailed advice on what steps
individuals should take next and why.
People who will be contacted are those who
may be at particular risk due to complex health problems such as:
1. Solid organ transplant recipients
2. People with specific cancers:
• People with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radical
radiotherapy for lung cancer
2
• People with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia,
lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment
• People having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for
cancer
• People having other targeted cancer treatments which can affect the immune
system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors.
• People who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last 6
months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs.
3. People with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic fibrosis, severe
asthma and severe COPD
4. People with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that significantly
increase the risk of infections (such as SCID, homozygous sickle cell)
5. People on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly increase risk of
infection
6. People who are pregnant with significant congenital heart disease
For the small number of NHS staff in this category, organisations can help staff by:
• Advising them not to contact their GP or healthcare team and to wait until they
are contacted directly. In this period, if staff identify to this category, they should
be supported to work flexibly, remotely or be redeployed from any high risk area.
• If staff have not been contacted by end of the week commencing 23 March by the
NHS, their GP or specialist and think they may be at particular risk due to these
specific health conditions, they should then get in touch with their GP practice for
further advice.
• Where staff receive a call from the NHS Business Services Authority, they should
then contact their line manager to discuss reasonable adjustments.
• Where staff are contacted and advice is provided to them, organisations should
support them as much as possible to adjust to this and allow them time to make
any necessary personal arrangements
2) Staff in ‘at risk’ groups
In addition, advice from Government confirmed that the groups of people who should
take particular care to minimise their social contact were:
• People over the age of 70
• Other adults who would normally be advised to have a flu vaccine (such as
those with chronic disease)
• Pregnant women. We know The Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists will provide and regularly review/ revise the latest guidance
and information. We therefore advise all staff who are pregnant to discuss
their individual circumstances with their local Occupational Health department.
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/news/national-guidance-on-managing-coronavirus-infection-in-pregnancy-published/
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/news/national-guidance-on-managing-coronavirus-infection-in-pregnancy-published/
3
For staff members in this category, the NHS will support staff to stay well and at
work. NHS organisations should make adjustments to enable this wherever possible.
Adjustments may include working remotely or moving to a lower risk area. Line
managers should get support from the locally nominated EPRR lead or, for example,
Medical/Nursing director or Chief Operating Officer to make this happen. NHS
organisations are encouraged to make it clear who the point of contact is in this
regard.
Action to be taken for staff will depend upon their condition and how stable it is.
Where a condition is unstable and there may be an increased risk to staff, the locally
nominated lead should ensure that conversations are undertaken with those staff as
to what steps need to be taken to keep an individual safe, and specialist advice
taken as required. In addition, they will continue to need the support of their line
manager and local occupational health service.
Where staff have to be redeployed or work from home, consideration should be
given to what duties they can continue to carry out in a role, and what support they
will need to do this.
Assistance should be provided to those staff who might be working or deployed in
higher risk areas by:
• Ensuring they are aware of the PHE guidance and how they can protect
themselves.
• Talk to them about their role and any elements which may put them at greater
risk.
• Discuss and develop a plan to implement any reasonable adjustments where
required, e.g. redeployment into less high-risk areas, reduced travel, working
from home.
• Seeking further advice from Occupational Health in the first instance, where
required further consultation with their specialist doctor regarding their
underlying condition in order to optimise their condition where possible.
• Signpost to further areas of support e.g. EAP programmes, counselling,
Our people are the most important consideration as they respond to the Coronavirus
pandemic. In these unprecedented times, our people more than ever will be making
every effort to care for patients and the population, and we must equal that with the
care for them.",a037e6e0-fb22-48ec-9a17-a35825e081f9.pdf

Details
This guidance is intended for:
people with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, and do not require hospital treatment, who must remain at home until they are well
those living in households with someone who shows symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus
The main messages are:
if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. See ending isolation section for more information
if you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill
for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14-day isolation period. See ending isolation section for more information
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community
if you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period
if you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible
if you have coronavirus symptoms:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
you do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home
testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home
plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home and consider what can be done for vulnerable people in the household
ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home
wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water, or use hand sanitiser
if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.
If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111.

If COVID19 becomes an established significant epidemic in the UK, NHS and HSC services in primary
and secondary care and public health across all four nations will be put under extreme pressure. This
pressure will inevitably be exacerbated by staff shortages due to sickness or caring responsibilities. It
will be a challenge for our profession. We are confident doctors will respond rapidly and professionally
and want to assure colleagues that we recognise this will require temporary changes to practice, and
that regulators and others will take this into account.
A significant epidemic will require healthcare professionals to be flexible in what they do. It may entail
working in unfamiliar circumstances or surroundings, or working in clinical areas outside of their usual
practice for the benefit of patients and the population as a whole. This can be stressful and you may
have concerns about both the professional practicalities and implications of working in such
circumstances.
We need to stick to the basic principles of being a good doctor. All doctors are expected to follow GMC
guidance and use their judgement in applying the principles to the situations they face, but these
rightly take account of the realities of a very abnormal emergency situation. We want doctors, in
partnership with patients, always to use their professional judgement to assess risk and to make sure
people receive safe care, informed by the values and principles set out in their professional standards.
A rational approach to varying practice in an emergency is part of that professional response.
It is the responsibility of GP practices, hospitals, trusts and health boards to ensure that clinicians
working in their organisations are supported to do this. They must bear in mind that clinicians may
need to depart, possibly significantly, from established procedures in order to care for patients in the
highly challenging but time-bound circumstances of the peak of an epidemic.
We expect employers, educational supervisors, professional bodies, and national NHS and HSC
organisations to be flexible in terms of their approach and the expectations of routine requirements.
Healthcare professional regulators, including the GMC, have already committed to take into account
factors relevant to the environment in which the professional is working, including relevant
information about resources, guidelines or protocols in place at the time.
Due consideration should and will be given to healthcare professionals and other staff who are using
their skills under difficult circumstances due to lack of personnel and overwhelming demand in a major
epidemic. This may include working outside their usual scope of practice.
The healthcare regulators
have already released a joint statement to explain this.
https://www.gmc-uk.org/news/news-
archive/how-we-will-continue-to-regulate-in-light-of-novel-coronavirus
We are determined to ensure the long-term prospects of doctors in training are not compromised.
The GMC, together with the education bodies in the four nations, are considering this.
Finally, we would like to thank you all for all the efforts you are already making. Many doctors across
the NHS, HSC and public health services have already made major contributions to the response to
COVID-19. We are very proud of the response of the medical profession in many disciplines whether
clinical, public health or laboratory to this challenge. It has been exemplary. We are confident of the
commitment, dedication, professionalism and hard work the whole profession has and will continue
to have in the very testing event of a significant epidemic in the UK.

NHS staff – hotel accommodation
20 March 2020
2 |2 |
Simon Stevens and Amanda Pritchard sent a letter to all NHS senior leaders on 17 March setting out the
steps that are being taken to support the NHS response to COVID-19. Part of that letter said:
Support our staff, and maximise staff availability
b) For those staff affected by PHE’s 14 day household isolation policy, staff should – on an entirely voluntary
basis – be offered the alternative option of staying in NHS-reimbursed hotel accommodation while they
continue to work.
NHS England and NHS Improvement have established a single process for NHS staff to secure
accommodation at hotels within their immediate area, if they have been affected by COVID-19 in some way.
The national response provides easy access to staff and while initially it will be a single phone number, in
due course it will also be available via an online portal.
Details on accessing the service are on the next slide, and the expectation is that the following staff groups
should be provided support:
• NHS staff who, as per the letter of 17 March, need hotel accommodation
• NHS staff whose family members are self-isolating and staff are not able to return home
• NHS staff who require emergency accommodation due to urgent response or mitigating factors
• Clinical Commissioning Groups can also provide accommodation to locum GPs/GPs and Community
Interest Company staff who are contracted to provide clinical services on a request and exception basis

3 |3 |
NHS staff who require accommodation at a hotel should:
Confirm with their line manager that accommodation is required; the line manager should then inform
the relevant finance team that bookings are being made so that this can be tracked by finance teams.
Contact CTM call centre on 01274 726424 (choosing ‘Hotel team’, then ‘Option 1’).
The booker should then be prepared to provide:
• Project code: NHS Support
• Guest name
• Telephone number for emergency
• Email address for confirmation
• Organisation name
• Organisation cost code
• Department
• Job title
Central Booking System
NHS Staff Hotel Accommodation
4 |4 |
The supplier of the service is CTM. In due course, an online booking system will be made available in
addition to the phone number.
CTM has national agreements with a wide number of hotel operators across the country. They will be
able to confirm availability at hotels as close to the required location as possible, however, certain
conditions will apply:
• Hotels should be informed as soon as possible if rooms are going to be cancelled, or room stays
are being extended
• Standard NHS England charges apply: outside of London the budget is £100 per night, within
London £150 per night
• We are working with hotels so that over the next few weeks as many rooms as possible come with
food included in the room rate
• Where food is currently not included, or where there are additional expenses for meals or sundry
items, please agree with your line manager and direct this to your employer rather than adding it to
the hotel bill.
• Hotels booked outside of this process will not be paid for through central finance
• The cost of the rooms will be paid on a central basis, but charged to the organisation’s cost code
connected to the COVID-19 response

NHS Staff Hotel Accommodation
5 |5 |
Hotel accommodation will be available to a range of health bodies and therefore members of staff of a
number of organisations will be sharing common areas within the hotels. This may obviously increase
the risk of passing the virus between healthcare colleagues working in different environments. We are
therefore requesting that where possible staff:
• Minimise time in communal areas of the hotel including receptions and corridors to reduce risk of
infection to colleagues.
• Where possible, to limit to 1 or 2 people at a time in lifts where possible, or to use the stairs if
appropriate.
• Ideally eat in your room. If meals are provided within the hotel, please try to sit at tables at least 2
metres apart from other residents in any bar or restaurant.
• We will be working with the hotels and providing guidance so they are aware of this and are
working to support you.
• We will update this hotel guidance pack and systems in due course, including a web portal to
make online bookings.

NHS England and NHS Improvement
19 March 2020
To cancer alliance
It is important that during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, appropriate
clinical priority is given in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and we
understand that service provision may need to flex as part of infection
control. The guidance below should be interpreted as modifying existing
Cancer Waiting Times guidance with immediate effect (19 March 2020) until
further notice:
• On receipt of a 2ww referral, providers should ensure that as far as
possible telephone triage is available to stream patients directly to a
test where appropriate and minimise interactions and appointments
with health services.
• A telephone appointment with an appropriate specialist clinician as
detailed in Cancer Waiting Times guidance will be accepted as ‘first
appointment’ for the purposes of recording Cancer Waiting Times data
until further notice.
• The policy remains that providers receiving referrals
may not downgrade urgent cancer referrals without the consent of the
referring primary care professional. Where capacity is particularly
constrained providers should ensure processes are in place to
prioritise particularly urgent referrals, including greater communication
between primary and secondary care to downgrade or avoid referrals
where possible.
• Where referrals are downgraded or avoided outside the usual policies
and NICE guidance, providers should seek to ensure appropriate
safety-netting so that if patients deteriorate or their risk of a cancer
diagnosis increases, they can be appropriately referred for further
investigation.
All providers receiving cancer referrals should continue to stay alert to
any further changes in this advice following updates from Government and
NHS England and NHS Improvement.

（COVID-19）的住戶的指南
更新日期 2020 年 3 月 16 日
病徵
冠狀病毒（COVID-19）最常見的病徵有：
·新的持續咳嗽和/或
·體溫過高
對於大多數人來說，冠狀病毒（COVID-19）將會引起輕度的疾病。
主要訊息
 ·如果您獨居並且有冠狀病毒（COVID-19）病徵，無論病徵輕重，請從出
現病徵之日起留在家中 7 天。（有關更多資訊，請參閲下面的結束隔離一
節）
 ·如果您與他人同住並且您或其中一個人出現冠狀病毒病徵，則所有住戶
成員都必須留在家中並且在 14 天期間不得離開屋子。為期 14 天的居家隔
離從家中第一個人生病當日開始計起。
 ·住在同一家的人們很可能會相互感染或已經被感染。留在家中 14 天將大
大減少住戶可能將病毒傳播給社區其他人的總體感染人數。
 ·對於住戶中開始出現病徵的任何人，從出現病徵之日起，他們都需要留
在家中 7 天，不論為期 14 天的隔離是在哪一天開始的。（有關更多資訊，
請參閲下面的結束隔離一節）
 ·如果可以的話，請為任何弱勢個體（例如長者和具有潛在健康狀況的
人）安排並搬到另一個安全空間，在居家隔離期間與朋友或家人住在一起
 ·如果無法為他們安排並搬到另一個安全空間，請盡可能遠離他們
 ·如果您有冠狀病毒病徵：
 ·請勿去全科醫生診所、藥房或醫院
 ·您無需聯絡 111告訴他們您目前留在家中
 ·如果您留在家中，則無需檢測冠狀病毒
 ·提前計劃並尋求其他人的幫助，以確保您可以成功留在家中，並考慮可
以為住戶中的弱勢群體做些什麼
 ·要求您的雇主、朋友和家人幫助您購買留在家中所需的日常用品
 ·經常用肥皂和水洗手至少 20秒鐘，或使用洗手液洗手

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#ending-isolation
 ·如果您覺得在家中無法抵抗病徵，病情惡化或 7天后病徵沒有好轉，請
使用 NHS 111 online冠狀病毒服務。如果家中沒有互聯網，請致電 NHS
111。若發生緊急醫療狀況，請致電 999
本指南適用於
該建議旨在：
 ·病徵可能是由冠狀病毒引起並且不需要住院接受治療的人，他們必須留
在家中直到病徵好轉
 ·居住在某人出現可能由冠狀病毒引起的病徵的住戶中
可以讓您度過 14 天的活動
為與您同住的人或家人制定一個計劃
您現在要做的事情就是計劃好您以及住戶中其他人如何在這 14天適應乏味的日子，以
便能夠遵循此建議。您可以準備的一些方法包括：
 ·與您的鄰居和家人商量，並交換住戶聯絡電話
 ·為您家中的弱勢成員考慮和計劃
 ·創建一個包含鄰居、學校、雇主、藥劑師和 NHS 111的電話號碼的聯絡
人列表
 ·盡可能設置網上購物賬戶
如果我們認為自己有冠狀病毒病徵，將對我的住戶進行檢測嗎？
如果您留在家中，則無需檢測冠狀病毒
為什麼留在家中很重要
出現可能由冠狀病毒引起的病徵的人及其住戶成員留在家中非常重要。留在家
中將有助於控制該病毒傳播給朋友、廣大社區尤其是最弱勢群體。
有病徵並獨居的人應在出現病徵之日起留在家中 7天（請參閱下方的結束自我
隔離）。這將減少您將病毒傳播給他人的風險。
如果您與他人同住並且您或其中一個人出現可能是由冠狀病毒引起的病徵，則
所有住戶成員都必須留在家中並且在 14 天期間不得離開屋子（請看自主我
離）。如果可能的話，除了運動以外，您甚至不應該外出購買食物或其它必需
品。如果您外出運動，請與他人保持安全距離。為期 14 天的居家隔離從家中
第一個人生病當日開始計起。

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#ending-isolation
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#ending-isolation
如果不可能的話，那麼當您離開家中購買必需品時，您應該盡力限制您的社交
接觸。
住在同一個住戶中的人們很可能會相互感染或已經被感染。留在家中 14天將
大大減少住戶可能將病毒傳播給社區其他人的總體感染人數。
留在家中可能時間很難過且令人沮喪，但是您可以做一些事情來打發時間。這
些包括：
 ·提前計劃，想一想您需要什麼才能留在家中整整 7天或 14天
 ·與您的雇主、朋友和家人商量，尋求他們的幫助，購買使您能夠成功留
在家中所需的一切
 ·想一想並計劃在此期間您將如何獲得食物和其它用品（例如藥物）
 ·要求朋友或家人送上您所需的物品或網上訂購必須品，但請確保這些物
品留在家外面，以供您領取
 ·確保您通過電話或社交媒體與朋友和家人保持聯絡
 ·想一想您在家中可以做的事情。能夠留在家中的人會好好利用一整天的
時間，例如做飯、閱讀、在線學習和看電影等活動
 ·許多人發現規劃整整 14天的日程（例如臨時日程表）會有所幫助。您也
可能會發現提前規劃好您的日程會有幫助，例如，如果住戶中有人的病徵
惡化，例如呼吸困難
 ·當您病徵好轉時，請記住做一些運動因為它對您的健康有所幫助。尋找
可以幫助您在家中進行輕運動的在線課程
留在家中時，請確保您做以下事情
留在家
您和所有的住戶成員應留在家中。請勿上班、上課或去公衆場所，也不要使用
公共交通或的士
如果可能的話，除了運動以外，您甚至不應該外出購買食物或其它必需品。如
果您外出運動，請與他人保持安全距離。為期 14天的居家隔離從家中第一個
人生病當日開始計起。
如果您需要食物雜貨、其它物品或領取藥物，或遛狗，則需尋求朋友或親戚的
協助。或者，您也可以用電話或上網訂購藥物。您也可以上網訂購物品。如果
您上網訂購物品，請確保您告訴送貨員將物品留在家外面，以供您領取。送貨
員不應入屋。
如果您是員工並且由于冠狀病毒而無法工作，請參閱 英國勞動和撫恤金部
的指南 查找有關您可用的支支援的資訊。

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-employees
如果您與孩子同住
盡您所能繼續遵循此建議，但是，我們知道並非所有這些措施都是可行的。
到目前為止，我們看到的是感染冠狀病毒的兒童受到的影響似乎較小。重要的
是，請盡最大可能遵守本指南。
如果您與脆弱的人同住
盡可能減少任何弱勢家庭成員在共享空間（如廚房、浴室和客廳）中度過的時
間，並確保共享空間通風良好。
嘗試與弱勢群體的人保持 2米（3步）距離，並鼓勵他們盡可能地睡在另一張
床上。如果可以，他們應該使用單獨的浴室，不應與其他住戶成員共用同一間
浴室。確保他們使用與家中其他成員不同的毛巾，不管是洗澡后用來擦身的毛
巾，還是用來擦手保持手部衛生的毛巾。
如果您確實與弱勢群體共用一間廁所和浴室，那麼每次使用后都務必清潔它們
（例如，抹一下您接觸過的表面），這一點很重要。另一個提示是考慮制定輪
流洗澡計劃，讓弱勢人群先使用該設施。
如果您與弱勢群體共用一間廚房，請避免在他們在場時使用。
如果可以的話，他們應該把飯菜帶回房間吃。（如果有）請使用洗碗機清洗和
烘乾家人使用過的餐具。（如果沒有）請使用您常使用的洗潔精和溫水清洗並
徹底烘乾使用過的餐具。如果弱視群體的人正在使用自己的餐具，請記住使用
單獨的茶巾將他們的餐具抹乾。
我們知道，對於某些人而言，留在家中並無法與其他人交流會很難受。您應盡
最大努力遵守本指南，並且住戶中的每個人都應經常洗手，避免觸摸臉部並清
潔經常觸摸的表面。
如果您在感染時喂母奶
目前尚無證據表明該病毒可通過母乳傳播。病毒可以通過與您密切接觸的任何
人的相同方式傳播給嬰兒。目前的證據表明，感染冠狀病毒的兒童的病徵比成
年人少得多。母乳喂養的好處超過通過母乳或密切接觸傳播病毒的任何潛在風
險；但是，您可以做出個人決定，是否要通過電話與您的助產士、家訪護士或
全科醫生進行討論。
如果您或您的家人正在餵配方奶或速溶牛奶，則在每次使用前應仔細對嬰兒用
品進行滅菌。請勿與他人共用奶瓶或吸奶器。
您可以在皇家婦產科醫師學院網站上找到更多資訊。
廢物的清理和處置
清理時，應使用您常使用的家用產品，例如清潔劑和漂白劑，因為它們對於清
除表面的病毒非常有效。清潔經常觸摸的表面，例如門把手、扶手、遙控器和
桌面。如果家中有年長或脆弱的人，這一點尤其重要。
可以將個人廢物（例如用過的紙巾）和一次性清潔布安全地存儲在一次性垃圾
袋中。這些袋子應放在另一個袋子中，綁緊並與其它廢物分開存放。在放置到
常用的外部家居廢物箱之前，應將其放置至少 72小時。
其他家居廢物可以照常處置。
洗衣房
為了最大程度地減少空氣中傳播病毒的可能性，請勿搖動髒衣服。
按照製造商的指示適當清洗衣物。所有髒衣服都可以在丟在同一桶内進行清
洗。
如果您家中沒有洗衣機，請在 7天（對於個人隔離）或 14天（對於居家隔
離）隔離期結束後再等待 72個小時，然後才能將衣物送至公共自助洗衣店。
您可以做些什麼來幫助自己更快痊愈
喝水以保持身體水分；您白天應該喝足夠的水，這樣您的尿（尿液）會呈淡白
色。您可以使用非處方藥（例如撲熱息痛）來緩解某些病徵。根據包裝或標籤
上的指示使用這些藥物，並且不要超過建議劑量。
如果您或您的家人需要看醫生
如果您的疾病或任何住戶成員的疾病持續惡化，請立即就醫。如果不是緊急狀
況，請通過 111.nhs.uk與 NHS 111 online聯絡。如果家中沒有互聯網，則應
致電 NHS 111。如果情況緊急並且您需要叫救護車，則應該告知電話接綫員您
或您的親戚有冠狀病毒病徵。
在您和家人留在家中期間，盡可能取消所有常規的門診和牙科預約。如果您擔
心或被要求在家隔離期間親自到診，請首先使用他們向您提供的電話號碼與您
的醫療聯絡人（例如您的全科醫生、當地醫院或門診服務）進行商討。如果您
擔心與冠狀病毒病徵有關，請聯絡 NHS 111 online。如果家中沒有互聯網，則
應致電 NHS 111。
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/
https://111.nhs.uk/
經常洗手
每天用肥皂和水清洗至少 20秒鐘或使用洗手液經常清潔雙手。這將有助於保
護您和與您同住的人。這一步驟是減少將病毒傳播給他人的風險最有效的方法
之一。
咳嗽和打噴嚏時請遮好
咳嗽或打噴嚏時請用一次性紙巾遮好您的口鼻。請打噴嚏到肘部彎曲處，而不
是噴在手中。
如果您有照護者，則在您打噴嚏或咳嗽後，他們應使用一次性紙巾抹走任何粘
液或痰液。然後，他們應該用肥皂和水洗手。
將紙巾丟入一次性垃圾袋中，並立即用肥皂和清水洗手或使用手部消毒液洗
手。
口罩
我們不建議使用口罩作為防止病毒傳播的有效方式。口罩在諸如醫院的臨床環
境中扮演著重要的角色，但是沒有什麽證據表明在這些環境之外使用口罩會帶
來益處。
不要接待訪客
請勿邀請或允許社交訪客（例如其他朋友和家人）入屋。如果有事要與不是家
中一員的人說，則請使用電話或社交媒體。
如果您或家庭成員接受基本的居家照護，則照護者應繼續探視。照護者將獲得
口罩和手套，以減少病毒傳播的風險。
如果在家中有寵物
目前，沒有證據表明伴生動物/寵物（如狗和貓）可以被冠狀病毒感染。
留在家中照顧您的健康
我們知道，對於某些人來說，長時間留在家中會很難受，令人沮喪和孤獨，您
或其他住戶成員可能會情緒低落。如果您家中沒有足夠的空間或花園讓您進行
一些戶外活動，則時間會更加難過。
重要的是要記住要照顧好自己的身心健康，並在需要時獲得支持。通過電話或
社交媒體與家人和朋友保持聯絡。還有一些有所幫助的支持和資訊來源，例如
Every Mind Matters website。
https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/
想一想您在家中可以做的事情。不介意留在家中的人會好好利用一整天的時
間，例如做飯、閱讀、在線學習和看電影等活動如果您病徵好轉，則可以在家
中或花園裡做輕度運動。
許多人發現如果提醒自己做這些事情如此重要對自己是很有幫助的。希望您的
家人不會出現類似流感的病徵。但是有些人會受到冠狀病毒的嚴重影響，特別
是長者和患有某些疾病的人士。留在家中，您可以保護他人的生命，並確保
NHS不會不堪重負。
結束自我隔離和家庭隔離
如果您有病徵，則可以在 7天后結束自我隔離。
為期 7天的自我隔離從您初次生病當日開始計起。
如果與他人同住，則所有健康狀況良好的住戶成員都可以在 14 天后結束家庭
隔離。為期 14 天的家庭隔離從家中第一個人生病當日開始計起。冠狀病毒的
潛伏期為 14天；14天后健康狀況良好的人不太可能感染冠狀病毒。
7 天后，如果第一個生病的人病徵好轉並且體溫不再過高，則可以恢復正常的
生活。如果在 14 天的家庭隔離期間任何其他家庭成員感到不適，則應遵循相
同的建議 - 即，在出現病徵 7 天后，如果病徵好轉並且體溫不再過高，他們
也可以恢復到正常的生活。
如果住戶成員在家庭隔離的 14 天后期（例如，在第 13 天或第 14 天）出現冠
狀病毒病徵 ，無需延長家庭隔離時間，但有新病徵的人必須留在家中 7 天
為期 14 天的家庭隔離將大大減少住戶中其他成員可能繼續將病毒傳播給其他
人的感染總人數，並且整個住戶無需重新開始為期 14 天的家庭隔離。這將為
社區帶來高度保護。進一步隔離該住戶成員幾乎沒有為社區帶來額外的保護。
在 14天的期限結束時，任何尚未康復的家庭成員都可以離開家庭隔離。
如果住戶中任何生病的人沒有任何好轉的跡象並且尚未尋求醫療建議，則應聯
絡 NHS 111 online如果家中沒有互聯網，則應致電 NHS 111。
儘管冠狀病毒感染已徹底消除，但某些人可能會有咳嗽的症狀並持續好幾周。
僅持續咳嗽並不意味著某人必須繼續自我隔離超過 7天。

Details
This guidance is intended for:
people with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, and do not require hospital treatment, who must remain at home until they are well
those living in households with someone who shows symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus
The main messages are:
if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. See ending isolation section for more information
if you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill
for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14-day isolation period. See ending isolation section for more information
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community
if you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period
if you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible
if you have coronavirus symptoms:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
you do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home
testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home
plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home and consider what can be done for vulnerable people in the household
ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home
wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water, or use hand sanitiser
if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.
If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111.

Details
This guidance is intended for:
people with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, and do not require hospital treatment, who must remain at home until they are well
those living in households with someone who shows symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus
The main messages are:
if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. See ending isolation section for more information
if you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill
for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14-day isolation period. See ending isolation section for more information
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community
if you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period
if you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible
if you have coronavirus symptoms:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
you do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home
testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home
plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home and consider what can be done for vulnerable people in the household
ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home
wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water, or use hand sanitiser
if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.
If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111.

Social media and comment moderation policy
Social media and comment moderation policy
Comments received via the NHS England website
Twitter
We encourage and welcome open, lively debate, but the decision to publish comments received via this site and our YouTube channel remains at our discretion. The views expressed by any third parties are solely theirs and are not necessarily endorsed by NHS England.
Comments on all pages may be closed after 4 weeks.
Moderation Policy
We ask you to please bear in mind our guidelines when submitting comments.
Where views have been sought, all comments will be considered before the response is published.
Moderation guidelines
We pre-moderate all of the comments we receive.
‘Pre-moderation’ means that comments will not be published instantly. Comments will be checked first by moderators who will monitor the site during normal working hours (0900 – 1700, GMT, Monday to Friday) and aim to process comments as quickly as possible.
This is not about censoring your views. The aim is to ensure that comments relate to the particular subject being discussed. Moderation will not be used to suppress legitimate, reasoned discussion.
Sometimes there is a delay in publishing whilst we seek information from various sources to be included in our response to questions.
We will normally approve comments for publication as long as they:
are on-topic. Please don’t post messages that are not related
respect other people. Comments should not be malicious or offensive in nature, and should not constitute a personal attack on a person’s character
don’t incite hatred on the basis of race, religion, gender, nationality or sexuality or any other personal characteristic
don’t reveal personal details, such as private addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or other online contact details
are reasonably concise, and don’t constitute spamming of the site
are not persistent or repetitive negative messages which aim to provoke a response and/or don’t constructively add to the conversation
don’t impersonate or falsely claim to represent a person or organisation
are not party political in nature. The NHS is always high on the political agenda, and whilst we acknowledge that references to political parties and their policies may often be inevitable, we reserve the right to exclude comments which are purely party-political in nature or seek to advertise political events.
don’t include swearing, hate-speech or obscenity
don’t break the law – this includes libel, condoning illegal activity, and breaking copyright
don’t advertise commercial products and services – you can mention relevant products and services as long as they support your comment
are in English – unfortunately, we do not currently have the resource to moderate comments in other languages
if you are aged 16 or under, please get you parent/guardian’s permission before submitting a comment. Users without this consent are not allowed to participate or provide us with personal information.
We reserve the right to suspend comments at any time, and remove comments older than six months. Where we choose not to publish a comment for a reason other than those listed above, we will reply to the commenter by email explaining our reason and inviting them to make appropriate changes so that the comment can be reconsidered.
We read every comment, and respond wherever we can. We endeavour to answer your questions where possible, but if you require an official response you should contact NHS England by post or email.
Twitter
NHS England uses Twitter, a free messaging service offered by a third party, as one tool in its efforts to communicate clearly, quickly and in an engaging manner to people interested in our work. You can follow us @NHSEngland
Twitter content delivered by NHS England includes (but is not limited to):
links to news releases, blog posts, videos, guidance and other approved, publicly available NHS England material
links to relevant information produced and published elsewhere (work of other NHS organisations, patient organisations, researchers, news organisations and others). This can include videos, blog posts, and retweets (RTs) from other Twitter users. (See below for our policy on RTs.)
interesting facts, quotes or observations related to our work
topical questions related to our work intended to provoke discussion
Retweets (RTs)
Tweets we repeat (RT) do not imply endorsement on the part of NHS England. We may retweet news, links and personal observations we believe are relevant to the work we do.
Twitter as a source of official policy
Tweets should not be considered as the authoritative source of new policy or guidance from NHS England. Any change or evolution in NHS England’s official position on legislation, guidance, investigations and audits will be communicated through more traditional channels: official publications and statements on our website, speeches, and media releases.
Importantly, our decision to RT should not be taken as explicit endorsement of any position or argument that may vary from NHS England’s current official position, nor should it be taken as an indication of a possible shift in the current official position.
Following
NHS England’s decision to follow a particular Twitter user does not imply endorsement of any kind. We follow accounts on Twitter we believe are relevant to our work. This could include following the Twitter accounts of companies and other commercial enterprises (and/or their employees) who comment on NHS England related issues.
Availability
We commit to updating and monitoring our Twitter account during regular office hours: 0900 – 1700, GMT. However, like many Twitter users, we may monitor and respond at other times of the day. We accept no responsibility for lack of service due to Twitter downtime.
@Replies and Direct Messages
We will read all @replies and Direct Messages sent to us and, when possible, will respond to them. Please note that, due to the volume of traffic on our Twitter account, it is not always possible to respond and we encourage users to use other ways to contact us if their question or comment requires urgent attention.
Complaints, Media Requests and Personal Issues
We encourage you to follow traditional channels to make a media request, freedom of information (FOI) request or complaint. See details of other ways to contact us.
NHS England Staff Tweeting
Some NHS England staff tweet under their own names or pseudonyms. Despite their professional affiliation with NHS England, their tweets do not represent the official position of the Board, and should be considered the product of each individual as a private citizen.

Symptoms
The most common symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) are recent onset of:
new continuous cough and/or
high temperature
For most people, coronavirus (COVID-19) will be a mild illness.
Main messages
if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. (The ending isolation section below has more information)
if you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill. See the explanatory diagram
for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14 day isolation period. The ending isolation section below has more information, and see the explanatory diagram
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community
if you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period
if you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible
if you have coronavirus symptoms:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
you do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home
testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home
plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home and consider what can be done for vulnerable people in the household
ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home
wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water, or use hand sanitiser
if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service. If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111. For a medical emergency dial 999
Who this guidance is for
This advice is intended for:
people with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, and do not require hospital treatment, who must remain at home until they are well
those living in households with someone who shows symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus
Things to help you prepare now
Make a plan for your household or family
The best thing you can do now is plan for how you can adapt your daily routine, and that of others in your household, to be able to follow this advice. Some of the ways in which you could prepare include:
talk to your neighbours and family and exchange phone numbers of household contacts
consider and plan for those in your home who are considered vulnerable
create a contact list with phone numbers of neighbours, schools, employer, chemist, NHS 111
set up online shopping accounts if possible
Will my household be tested if we think we have coronavirus symptoms?
Testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home.
Why staying at home is very important
It is very important that individuals with symptoms that may be due to coronavirus and their household members stay at home. Staying at home will help control the spread of the virus to friends, the wider community, and particularly the most vulnerable.
Those with symptoms and living alone should remain at home for 7 days after the onset of their symptoms (see ending self-isolation below). This will reduce the risk of you infecting others.
If you live with others and you or one of them have symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, then household members must stay at home and not leave your house for 14 days (more information in the ending self-isolation section below). If possible, you should not go out even to buy food or other essentials, other than exercise, and in that case at a safe distance from others. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in your house became ill.
If not possible, then you should do what you can to limit your social contact when you leave the house to get supplies.
It is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or may already be infected. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community.
Staying at home may be difficult and frustrating, but there are things that you can do to help make it easier. These include:
plan ahead and think about what you will need in order to be able to stay at home for the full 7 or 14 days
talk to your employer, friends and family to ask for their help to access the things you will need to make your stay at home a success
think about and plan how you can get access to food and other supplies such as medications that you will need during this period
ask friends or family to drop off anything you need or order supplies online, but make sure these are left outside your home for you to collect
make sure that you keep in touch with friends and family over the phone or through social media
think about things you can do during your time at home. People who have successfully completed a period of staying at home have kept themselves busy with activities such as cooking, reading, online learning and watching films
many people find it helpful to plan out the full 14 days, such as on a make-shift calendar. You may also find it helpful to plan in advance what you will do if, for example, someone in the household were to feel much worse, such as have difficulties breathing
when you are feeling better, remember that physical exercise can be good for your wellbeing. Look for online classes or courses that can help you take light exercise in your home
While you are staying at home, make sure you do the following things
Stay at home
You and all household members should remain at home. Do not go to work, school, or public areas, and do not use public transport or taxis.
If possible, you should not go out even to buy food or other essentials, other than exercise, and in that case at a safe distance from others. The 14-day period starts from the day the first person in your house became ill.
If you require help with buying groceries, other shopping or picking up medication, or walking a dog, you will need to ask friends or relatives. Alternatively, you can order medication by phone or online. You can also order your shopping online. Make sure you tell delivery drivers to leave items outside for collection if you order online. The delivery driver should not come into your home.
If you are an employee and unable to work due to coronavirus, please refer to this guidance from the Department for Work and Pensions to find out about the support that is available to you.
If you are living with children
Keep following this advice to the best of your ability, however, we are aware that not all these measures will be possible.
What we have seen so far is that children with coronavirus appear to be less severely affected. It is nevertheless important to do your best to follow this guidance.
If you have a vulnerable person living with you
Minimise as much as possible the time any vulnerable family members spend in shared spaces such as kitchens, bathrooms and sitting areas, and keep shared spaces well ventilated.
Aim to keep 2 metres (3 steps) away from vulnerable people you live with and encourage them to sleep in a different bed where possible. If they can, they should use a separate bathroom from the rest of the household. Make sure they use separate towels from the other people in your house, both for drying themselves after bathing or showering and for hand-hygiene purposes.
If you do share a toilet and bathroom with a vulnerable person, it is important that you clean them every time you use them (for example, wiping surfaces you have come into contact with). Another tip is to consider drawing up a rota for bathing, with the vulnerable person using the facilities first.
If you share a kitchen with a vulnerable person, avoid using it while they are present. If they can, they should take their meals back to their room to eat. If you have one, use a dishwasher to clean and dry the family’s used crockery and cutlery. If this is not possible, wash them using your usual washing up liquid and warm water and dry them thoroughly. If the vulnerable person is using their own utensils, remember to use a separate tea towel for drying these.
We understand that it will be difficult for some people to separate themselves from others at home. You should do your very best to follow this guidance and everyone in your household should regularly wash their hands, avoid touching their face, and clean frequently touched surfaces.
If you are breastfeeding while infected
There is currently no evidence to suggest that the virus can be transmitted through breast milk. Infection can be spread to the baby in the same way as to anyone in close contact with you. The current evidence is that children with coronavirus get much less severe symptoms than adults. The benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breast milk or by being in close contact; however, this will be an individual decision and can be discussed with your midwife, health visitor or GP by telephone.
If you or a family member are feeding with formula or expressed milk, you should sterilise the equipment carefully before each use. You should not share bottles or a breast pump with someone else.
You can find more information at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists website.
Cleaning and disposal of waste
When cleaning you should use your usual household products, like detergents and bleach, as these will be very effective at getting rid of the virus on surfaces. Clean frequently touched surfaces such as door handles, handrails, remote controls and table tops. This is particularly important if you have an older or vulnerable person in the house.
Personal waste (such as used tissues) and disposable cleaning cloths can be stored securely within disposable rubbish bags. These bags should be placed into another bag, tied securely and kept separate from other waste. This should be put aside for at least 72 hours before being put in your usual external household waste bin.
Other household waste can be disposed of as normal.
Laundry
To minimise the possibility of dispersing virus through the air, do not shake dirty laundry.
Wash items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. All dirty laundry can be washed in the same load.
If you do not have a washing machine, wait a further 72 hours after your 7-day (for individual isolation) or 14-day isolation period (for households) has ended when you can then take the laundry to a public launderette.
What you can do to help yourself get better
Drink water to keep yourself hydrated; you should drink enough during the day so your urine (pee) is a pale clear colour. You can use over-the-counter medications, such as paracetamol, to help with some of your symptoms. Use these according to the instructions on the packet or label and do not exceed the recommended dose.
If you or your family need to seek medical advice
Seek prompt medical attention if your illness or the illness in any household members is worsening. If it’s not an emergency, contact NHS 111 online. If you have no internet access, you should call NHS 111. If it is an emergency and you need to call an ambulance, dial 999 and inform the call handler or operator that you or your relative have coronavirus symptoms.
All routine medical and dental appointments should usually be cancelled whilst you and the family are staying at home. If you are concerned or have been asked to attend in person within the period you are home isolating, discuss this with your medical contact first (for example, your GP, local hospital or outpatient service), using the number they have provided. If your concerns are related to your coronavirus symptoms contact NHS 111 online. If you have no internet access, you should call NHS 111.
Wash your hands often
Clean your hands frequently each day by washing with soap and water for 20 seconds or using hand sanitiser.
This will help protect you and the people you live with. This step is one of the most effective ways of reducing the risk of passing infection to others.
Cover your coughs and sneezes
Cover your mouth and nose with disposable tissues when you cough or sneeze. If you do not have one to hand, sneeze into the crook of your elbow, not into your hand.
If you have a carer, they should use disposable tissues to wipe away any mucus or phlegm after you have sneezed or coughed. Then they should wash their hands with soap and water.
Dispose of tissues into a disposable rubbish bag and immediately wash your hands with soap and water or use a hand sanitiser.
Facemasks
We do not recommend the use of facemasks as an effective means of preventing the spread of infection. Facemasks play an important role in clinical settings, such as hospitals, but there’s very little evidence of benefit from their use outside of these settings.
Do not have visitors in your home
Do not invite or allow social visitors, such as other friends and family, to enter your home. If you want to speak to someone who is not a member of your household, use the phone or social media.
If you or a family member receive essential care in your home, then carers should continue to visit. Carers will be provided with facemasks and gloves to reduce the risk of you passing on the infection.
If you have pets in the household
At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs and cats can be infected with coronavirus.
Looking after your wellbeing while staying at home
We know that staying at home for a prolonged period can be difficult, frustrating and lonely for some people and that you or other household members may feel low. It can be particularly challenging if you don’t have much space or access to a garden.
It’s important to remember to take care of your mind as well as your body and to get support if you need it. Stay in touch with family and friends over the phone or on social media. There are also sources of support and information that can help, such as the Every Mind Matters website.
Think about things you can do during your time at home. People who have not minded staying at home for a week have kept themselves busy with activities such as cooking, reading, online learning and watching films. If you feel well enough you can take part in light exercise within your home or garden.
Many people find it helpful to remind themselves why what they are doing is so important. Hopefully, none of your family will suffer more than flu-like symptoms. But some people are badly affected by coronavirus, and particularly the elderly and those with certain medical conditions. By staying home, you are protecting the lives of others, as well as making sure the NHS does not get overwhelmed.
Ending self-isolation and household-isolation
Self-isolation
If you have been symptomatic, then you may end your self-isolation after 7 days. The 7-day period starts from the day when you first became ill
Household isolation
If living with others, then all household members who remain well may end household-isolation after 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day illness began in the first person to become ill. Fourteen days is the incubation period for coronavirus; people who remain well after 14 days are unlikely to be infectious.
After 7 days, if the first person to become ill feels better and no longer has a high temperature, they can return to their normal routine. If any other family members become unwell during the 14-day household-isolation period, they should follow the same advice - that is, after 7 days of their symptoms starting, if they feel better and no longer have a high temperature, they can also return to their normal routine.
Should a household member develop coronavirus symptoms late in the 14-day household-isolation period (for example, on day 13 or day 14) the isolation period does not need to be extended, but the person with the new symptoms has to stay at home for 7 days. The 14-day household-isolation period will have greatly reduced the overall amount of infection the rest of the household could pass on, and it is not necessary to restart 14 days of isolation for the whole household. This will have provided a high level of community protection. Further isolation of members of this household will provide very little additional community protection.
At the end of the 14-day period, any family member who has not become unwell can leave household isolation.
If any ill person in the household has not had any signs of improvement and have not already sought medical advice, they should contact NHS 111 online. If your home has no internet access, you should call NHS 111.
The cough may persist for several weeks in some people, despite the coronavirus infection having cleared. A persistent cough alone does not mean someone must continue to self-isolate for more than 7 days.

NHS England and NHS Improvement
Briefing: Primary care providers and the coronavirus (COVID-19)
The NHS and Public Health England (PHE) are well prepared for outbreaks of new
infectious diseases. The NHS has put in place measures to ensure the safety of all patients
and NHS staff while also ensuring services are available to the public as normal.
The approach being taken by the NHS is to identify potential cases of COVID-19, isolate
them and then contain the virus. This model is devised to protect primary care, the
ambulance service and our emergency departments so they can operate as usual and
assist the sickest patients.
What is the advice to patients and the public?
The advice to the public is to call NHS 111 now if they have been:
• to Wuhan or Hubei Province in China in the last 14 days (even if they do not have
symptoms)
• to other parts of China, including Macau and Hong Kong, in the last 14 days and
have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breath (even if it's mild)
• to Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Republic of Korea or Malaysia in the last 14
days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breath (even if it's mild)
• in close contact with someone with confirmed coronavirus.
Anyone who meets the above criteria is advised not to go to a GP surgery, community
pharmacy or hospital. Instead they should call NHS 111, stay indoors and avoid close
contact with other people.
Information for the public is available at nhs.uk
Is NHS 111 directing possible cases to GP practices and community pharmacies?
No. If someone calls NHS 111 they are assessed against a clinical pathway. If they are
identified as a possible COVID-19 case, NHS 111 will not refer them to a GP or community
pharmacy.
However, if someone calls NHS 111 and is assessed against the clinical pathway and they
are not a possible COVID-19 case, for example they have not recently travelled to any of
the affected areas or been in close contact with a confirmed case, NHS 111 would handle
their call as normal. This may mean referring them to a GP, pharmacist or dental practice,
based on patient need.

Coronavirus Primary Care Briefing – 18 February 2020
What do primary care providers do if a patient turns up with suspected COVID-19?
PHE has produced detailed guidance for primary care providers which is available here.
The key principles are to:
• identify potential cases as soon as possible
• prevent potential transmission of infection to other patients and staff
• avoid direct physical contact, including physical examination, and exposures to
respiratory secretions
• isolate the patient, obtain specialist advice and determine if the patient is at risk of
COVID-19 infection.
This guidance also includes information on patient transfers and cleaning your premises
following a possible case.
What if I’m a community pharmacist without a consultation room?
If your pharmacy does not have a consultation room, it is effectively a public place. The
same advice that would be given to any suspected case should be followed: go home
immediately, avoid contact with others, cover your mouth and nose on the way home and
call NHS 111.
If I come into contact with a suspected case, should I continue to see other patients?
The guidance for healthcare workers covers those who have travelled or have come into
contact with a known case. However, if primary care providers come into contact (using the
definition of close contact here) with a suspected case they should continue to practise as
normal. Should the case then be confirmed, PHE will undertake contact tracing which may
include the practitioner.
Is there any information my practice can share with patients?
Additional resources have been made available for primary care providers. Please ensure
that you share and display these as appropriate:
• posters for primary care settings are available on the PHE campaign resource
website.
• additional resources for telephone systems, SMS messaging systems, websites and
online booking systems are available in Annex 1.
What happens if someone self-isolating because of COVID-19 risk calls for a review
for another problem – who should handle this?
Patients should call NHS 111 in the first instance and they will be directed to the
appropriate resource. If a GP visit is needed, a telephone consultation should be held. If a
home visit is needed, speak with your local Health Protection Team (HPT) for advice on
personal protective equipment (PPE). If a visit is advised, whoever does the visit needs to
keep a minimum of two metres distance from the patient and avoid physical examination.

Coronavirus Primary Care Briefing – 18 February 2020
What Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is needed when dealing with patients?
If following the above guidance, PPE should not be needed when dealing with patients as
patients should be identified on entry and isolated as soon as possible.
Dental teams should continue to comply with existing PPE guidance HTM01 and continue
to use the same PPE they routinely do.
Are there supply issues with PPE?
No, there is a large stock of face masks in the UK. PHE manages stocks of PPE, including
face masks as part of its Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) stockpiles. In addition to
UK-held stocks, NHS Supply Chain has placed additional orders for PPE and is also
working with wholesalers to support frontline services.
In addition to this, NHS Supply Chain manages a ‘business as usual’ stock of face masks
and routinely supplies NHS secondary care services with PPE, including face masks. NHS
Supply Chain also retains its EU exit stockpile, which includes stocks of PPE.
Who carries out decontamination?
Every General Medical Practitioner (GMP) and General Dental Practitioner (GDP) has to be
registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and should be meeting the
requirements for the Health and Social Care Act to maintain a clean and safe environment.
It is the responsibility of the registered organisation to ensure their staff are appropriately
trained and have access to equipment. Details of how to clean are in the primary care
guidance.
Other primary care settings should follow the guidance. For additional information you can
contact your local Health Protection Team.
What PPE is needed when cleaning?
Use the PPE equipment that would normally be used when cleaning and disinfecting, in the
same way as if someone had vomited in the surgery. Cleaners should use disposable
plastic aprons and gloves and follow the usual cleaning COSH guidance. You do not need
Hazmat equipment to clean. The gloves and disposable aprons should already be available
and in supply at primary care providers.
What happens if a provider needs to close?
If providers are following the advice set out in the guidance, they should be identifying
patients as soon as possible and isolating them. It is only necessary to clean and
decontaminate the areas where a suspected case has been isolated. It is not always
necessary to deep clean the whole premises where only one consultation room needs to be
cleaned.
If the primary care setting is advised to close by the HPT, normal procedures are to be
followed. So, for GPs this would involve alerting the CCG in order for local contingencies to
be activated. GDPs are to inform their dental commissioning leads that the practice is
closing on advice of the HPT.

Coronavirus Primary Care Briefing – 18 February 2020
If pharmacies have to shut, they must inform the NHS 111 Directory of Services (DoS)
helpline (0300 0200 363). If they are likely to be closed for longer than 24 hours then they
must be clear that they are requesting a longer term withdrawal from providing the NHS 111
DoS. The local NHS England and NHS Improvement team must also be informed by the
pharmacy contractor. This is particularly critical for pharmacies providing the Community
Pharmacist Consultation Service (CPCS).
We would expect closure to be temporary for cleaning, and contingency plans by the CCG
(or appropriate commissioner) will be activated. Further information is available in the full
guidance for primary care settings.
How are people tested for COVID-19?
Most cases will require a single nose and throat swab for the diagnosis of COVID-19 which
will be sent to PHE Colindale or identified regional laboratories for testing.
Samples required are:
• either a combined nose and throat swab in one collection tube containing universal
transport medium
• or a single swab used for throat then nose
• or individual nose and throat swabs in separate collection tubes.
What further information is available for primary care?
Information published by Public Health England is available here.
NHS England and NHS Improvement have established a primary care working group to
address issues that may arise should the virus spread – such as capacity, supply chain, any
contracting issues, additional support, etc. Appropriate information will be circulated if and
when the situation develops.
Does any of this impact upon indemnity?
At present, this work is considered to be business as usual. However, the primary care
working group is examining the impact upon indemnity should the virus spread.

Coronavirus Primary Care Briefing – 18 February 2020
Do not go to a GP surgery, community pharmacy or hospital. Call 111, stay
indoors and avoid close contact with other people.
Further information is available on nhs.uk.
Like the common cold, coronavirus infection usually occurs through close contact
with a person with novel coronavirus via cough and sneezes or hand contact. A
person can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces if they do not wash
their hands.
The risk of being in close contact with a person with coronavirus or contaminated
surfaces is very low at the current time, as members of the public who have visited
Wuhan or Hubei province, China are currently in isolation.
Testing of suspected coronavirus cases is carried out in line with strict regulations.
This means that suspected cases are kept in isolation, away from public areas of the
hospital and returned home also in isolation. Any equipment that come into contact
with suspected cases are thoroughly cleaned as appropriate. Specific guidance has
also been shared with NHS staff to help safeguard them and others. Patients can be
reassured that their safety is a top priority, and are encouraged to attend all
appointments as usual.
Everyone is being reminded to follow Public Health England advice to:
• Always carry tissues with you and use them to catch your cough or sneeze.
Then bin the tissue, and wash your hands, or use a sanitiser gel.
• Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after using public
transport. Use a sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available.
• Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
• Avoid close contact with people who are unwell.
You can find the latest information and advice from Public Health England at Further
information is available on nhs.uk.

Wherever you can help, you’re needed
As a qualified and experienced health and social care professional who has either temporarily or permanently left the NHS, your colleagues and local community are in urgent need of your support to join the fight against COVID-19 in a number of different ways that don’t have to involve frontline care.
COVID-19 has the potential to put huge additional demand on our NHS and our fellow citizens. In such emergencies, the GPhC has powers to register on a temporary basis fit, proper and suitably experienced people to act as pharmacists and pharmacy technicians during the emergency.
We greatly appreciate the time and effort that you have already given the NHS and have put everything in place to ensure re-joining us is easy and safe for you (in fact it will be done automatically if you choose to return). You can choose how much time you contribute and are free to stop working at any point. Your contract will reflect standard terms and conditions such as working hour protections, pay arrangements, and annual leave entitlement.
This isn’t only about clinically treating patients – there is also a need to provide a calm and stoic presence whose ripple effect is felt way beyond any health or social care setting. Many members of the general public are anxious and need reassurance. Your expertise can help in so many ways, so even if you fall into a group which is considered to be at increased risk, you can still offer valuable support through a variety of roles in secondary, community and primary care.
We would be extremely grateful for any help that you are able to offer and have developed a survey to help understand how best to use your skills. Please complete it to indicate whether this is something you’d be willing to consider. Understandably, you will have important questions to ask before making your decision, whether that be around your own health and wellbeing, professional indemnity, pensions or remuneration. We have aimed to answer many of these here but if you have any further queries, do please contact the team at nhsi.pharmacy.returners@nhs.net.
Your expertise and experience will be valued beyond measure at this difficult time.
Frequently asked questions
What will I be paid if I return to work? How much will I get and how regularly?
During the emergency period you should be paid on the appropriate contract for the role you are fulfilling, providing you return to the same level of responsibility.
All staff that return to work in the NHS will be paid the substantive rate for their role. The actual amount and the frequency will be confirmed by your employer.
Pharmacists who return to work in a hospital or general practice setting will usually return on a pay point that is no lower than when you retired.
Community pharmacy is not part of the Agenda for Change pay model used in these settings.
However, employers will be expected to pay at comparable pay rates to reflect skill base and training.
Will I receive the same pay I received when I retired?
If you return to the NHS after retirement, you should be paid on the pay point which is no lower than the pay point before you retired for a similar role.
Community pharmacy is not part of the Agenda for Change pay model.
However, employers will be expected to pay at comparable pay rates to reflect skill base and training.
What if I have not retired, but just left the NHS? What will I be paid if I return to work? How much will I get and how regularly?
If you have not retired, but left NHS employment, you will be paid appropriately for the role you are filling.
If you return to work in roles covered by NHS national terms and conditions of service, the actual amount and the frequency will be confirmed by your employer.
Can I help without being in a face to face role?
Yes. There are also opportunities for face to face roles, such working with the COVID-19 Response Service (CRS) or NHS 111. In addition, local OOH providers, GP surgeries and PCNs have non face to face roles which urgently require support.
What if I do not want to return to the role I left, what if I want to return to a more junior role – how will my pay be affected?
If you want to return to a more junior role, you will still be paid the substantive rate for your role and should be paid at the top of the pay scale for that role. Community pharmacy is not part of the Agenda for Change pay model.
However, employers will be expected to pay at comparable pay rates to reflect skill base and training.
Where will I be placed/could I be sent to another part of the country?
We want to make sure that we look after anyone who chooses to temporarily return to work. This may mean that you are placed with a remote or digital service, such as CRS or 111, so you would not need to consider moving to a different area. In any instances where returning pharmacists or pharmacy technicians are needed to deliver face to face service provision, where possible, you will be sent to an area where you have worked before or are already linked with. There might be rare occasions where we would ask if you would consider moving to a different area to cover an acute workforce shortage, but this would of course be at your discretion and discussed with you beforehand.
Will I have insurance and indemnity covered?
If engaged by an NHS trust to provide NHS services, individuals will be covered by the Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts (CNST). If engaged by a GP practice to provide NHS services, individuals will be covered by the Clinical Negligence Scheme for General Practice (CNSGP). It is envisaged that where clinical staff are brought back to help in delivering NHS services for the purposes of dealing with the coronavirus outbreak that:
They will be covered under the CNST if they are engaged by an NHS trust to provide the NHS services (irrespective of where the services are provided – in hospital, a clinic or on GP premises), or
They will be covered by the CNSGP if they are engaged by a GP practice or Part 4 contractor to provide NHS services that are either:
Primary medical services (provided under a GP contract [Part 4 NHS Services Act 2006] – GMS/PMS/APMS)
Another type of NHS service provided as part of the activities of the GP practice
Indemnity for those working in community pharmacy should be discussed with the employer.
Will I have to pay to go back onto the GPhC register?
No, you will not have to pay to temporarily return to the GPhC register.
Will I be expected to -do revalidation?
No, this will not be necessary. However, all persons entered temporarily on the register will be required to meet the standards for pharmacy professionals.
As part of this, they will be required to work within their areas of competence and make clear to their employer if there are specific tasks or practices that they do not feel competent to undertake, for example due to developments that have taken place in pharmacy practice since their previous withdrawal from the register.
Will I receive an induction process?
Yes – you will receive a fast track induction that will cover key mandatory training requirements, as well as more specific guidance, for example, on the management of coronavirus and use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), return to practice courses are also available. There would also be local employer-led induction. Employers and service providers remain responsible for making sure that temporarily registered workers are competent for role, and are appropriately inducted, trained and supervised.
Will I need clearance from the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) – formerly the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB)
Yes, though if you have a recent DBS Certificate or have maintained a subscription to the DBS Update Service then it may not be necessary for a further application to be submitted.
An assessment will be undertaken by your employing organisation, utilising guidance from NHS Employers, to determine if a further check is required.
Where a new DBS application is required, the DBS are proposing to extend the scope of their services to include a new fast track check against the adults and/children’s barred lists.
These arrangements will enable employers to recruit into a regulated activity in advance of receiving the full disclosure certificate, where they have undertaken a risk assessment and put in place appropriate monitoring and supervision.
You will not be required to pay for a DBS check.
I have a co-morbidity or am a primary carer, can I also work?
Given the increased risk of covid-19 in those with co-morbidity and in the elderly population, we would advise this group against returning to face to face clinical work. However, there may be a non-face to face role that you are interested in exploring.
I’ve accepted temporary registration. What will happen next? How will I find out where I’ll be working?
With permission, your contact details will be passed on to regional teams so that you can be linked with local providers.
Will I be sent to multiple different pharmacies/practices/hospitals or stay in one role?
Ideally you would be placed in one role, but this cannot be guaranteed. Any proposed changes to your role would be discussed with you first.
Will I need to learn new skills?
Fast-track induction processes are being developed locally. This will include refreshing on old skills, such as dispensing processes and prescribing where appropriate, as well as new skills such as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) training.
What if I become ill when I am working?
If you become ill while working, you should immediately inform your line manager and withdraw from work. If you think you may be ill due to covid-19 you should follow national guidance in place at the time (likely to be self-isolation).
What if I change my mind and don’t want to work anymore – who do I tell?
If you change your mind and don’t want to work anymore you should tell your line manager. A professional approach would be expected – for example not leaving in the middle of a shift.
Could I be asked to work in an area I am not familiar with?
As far as possible, we aim to match you to a suitable role. In some situations, you may need to be placed in a different role according to service requirements. Where this is necessary, you will be supported adequately to take on these roles. Training and supervision will be given.
I am working in an educational or research role, what are the next steps for me?
If you have a joint contract between clinical and educational/research roles, your provider trust will contact you to discuss whether you are prepared to give up these activities in the short term (unless working on education or research in relation to covid-19) to provide more clinical support in the workplace. Those with teaching expertise may be able to help provide induction for others including those returning staff – for example, in the use of PPE, managing high flow oxygen or ventilated patients (if appropriately trained to do so).
I work in a part time clinical role, what are the next steps for me?
Discuss with your employers under what circumstances you should temporarily suspend your external commitments in order to provide more clinical support in your employing organisation. The balance between supporting front-line NHS services directly and delivering the business as usual work of the national bodies should be carefully balanced in each case.
What sort of work might I be expected to do? Will I have a choice?
There are multiple possible roles that you might be expected to take on including face to face roles in clinical areas across the NHS, medicines supply and assurance roles. Decisions as to how you are deployed will take account of individual knowledge, competence and experience.
How long will I be needed for?
You will be needed for a limited time period but at this stage, the exact length is unpredictable. You are free to stop working at any point. Contracts are likely to be drawn up for 6 months with the possibility for extension.
Will I have a contract?
Yes. You will have a contract that reflects all the working hour protections, pay arrangements, annual leave entitlement and inductions that are provided to new staff.
What documentation do I need to have checked before I start work? Can this be done remotely?
Identity checks will be required but this will be a fast-track process. Owners of registered pharmacies must continue to meet the Standards for Registered Pharmacies, including in respect of temporarily registered staff.
Will I have a rota/need to work a specific number of hours?
If you perform a role which requires one, you may be placed on a rota but this will be discussed with the organisation you will be placed in locally.
Will you check that I don’t have coronavirus?
If you develop symptoms, national guidance for testing will be followed.
What happens if I treat patients while having coronavirus?
As soon as coronavirus is identified in staff, they will be withdrawn from work and national guidance will be followed.
I’m pregnant or immunosuppressed. What rights do I have to protect myself from infection at work?
If you decide to return to work, a risk assessment will be conducted locally and you are advised to avoid COVID-19 exposure, which could mean redeployment to a non-frontline role where remote working is possible.
Is there specific advice for other high-risk chronic diseases?
People with chronic heart and lung disease have a higher risk of complications and higher mortality than the general population. We would not advise this group to return to directly face to face roles.
How can I decline if I am asked to work beyond my clinical competence?
If the epidemic worsens it is likely that healthcare professionals will have to work outside their normal field of practice. When deciding the safest and best course of action in the circumstances, individuals should consider factors including what is within their knowledge and skills; the protection and needs of all patients they have a responsibility towards; and minimising the risk of transmission and protecting their own health.
We do not want indemnity to be any barrier to flexible working, so the Government is planning to introduce additional indemnity coverage for clinical negligence liabilities that may arise when staff are working as part of the COVID-19 response or undertaking NHS work to backfill others, in the event that existing arrangements (CNST, CNSGP or individual arrangements) do not cover a particular activity.
The GPhC acknowledges that pharmacy professionals may be anxious about context not being taken into account when concerns are raised about their actions in very challenging circumstances. Where a concern is raised about a registered professional, it will always be considered on the specific facts of the case, taking into account the factors relevant to the environment in which the professional is working. The GPhC would also take account of any relevant information about resources, guidelines, or protocols in place at the time.
How would I handle patients’ requests for extra medication?
While there are currently no reported medicine shortages as a result of COVID-19, doctors and pharmacy professionals may face requests from patients for extra medication to stockpile. Medical Defence Organisations have advised doctors to resist pressure to overprescribe and to stick to existing policy on repeat prescribing unless they receive official advice stating otherwise.
Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians should support this messaging to patients, and discourage any attempt to stockpile medicines, whether on prescription, or by purchase of over the counter medications.

Wherever you can help, you’re needed
As a qualified and experienced health and social care professional who has either temporarily or permanently left the NHS, your colleagues and local community are in urgent need of your support to join the fight against COVID-19 in a number of different ways that don’t have to involve frontline care.
COVID-19 has the potential to put huge additional demand on our NHS and our fellow citizens. In such emergencies, the GMC can grant temporary registration to certain groups, the first being fully qualified and experienced doctors of good standing who have recently relinquished their registration or licence to practise. Those wishing to return to primary care will also need to be included on the Performers List.
We greatly appreciate the time and effort that you have already given the NHS and have put everything in place to ensure re-joining us is easy and safe for you (in fact it will be done automatically if you choose to return). You can choose how much time you contribute and are free to stop working at any point. Your contract will reflect standard terms and conditions such as working hour protections, pay arrangements, and annual leave entitlement.
This isn’t only about clinically treating patients – there is also a need to provide a calm and stoic presence whose ripple effect is felt way beyond any health or social care setting. Many members of the general public are anxious and need reassurance. Your expertise can help in so many ways, so even if you fall into a group which is considered to be at increased risk, you can still offer valuable support through a variety of roles in secondary, community and primary care.
We would be extremely grateful for any help that you are able to offer and have developed a survey to help understand how best to use your skills. Please complete it to indicate whether this is something you’d be willing to consider. Understandably, you will have important questions to ask before making your decision, whether that be around your own health and wellbeing, professional indemnity, pensions or remuneration.
We have aimed to answer many of these here but if you have any further queries, do please email nhsi.medical.nonGP.returners@nhs.net or nhsi.medicalGP.returners@nhs.net as appropriate.
Your expertise and experience will be valued beyond measure at this difficult time.
Thank you.
Frequently asked questions for returning doctors
What will I be paid if I return to work? How much will I get and how regularly?
During the emergency period, you should be paid on the appropriate contract for the role you are fulfilling, providing you return to the same level of responsibility.
All staff who return to work in the NHS will be paid the substantive rate for their role. The actual amount and the frequency will be confirmed by your employer.
Will I receive the same pay I received when I retired?
If you return to the NHS after retirement you should be paid on the pay point which is no lower than the pay point before you retired. Remuneration for GP work will be benchmarked to similar work and prevailing salary levels.
What if I have not retired, but just left the NHS? What will I be paid if I return to work? How much will I get and how regularly?
If you have not retired, but left NHS employment, you will be paid at the top of the appropriate pay scale for the role you are filling. If you return to work in roles covered by NHS national terms and conditions of service, the actual amount and the frequency will be confirmed by your employer.
Can I help without being in a directly face to face role?
Yes. There are many opportunities for non-face to face roles, such as working with the COVID-19 Response Service (CRS) or NHS 111. In addition, local OOH providers, GP surgeries and PCNs have non-face to face roles which urgently require support.
What if I do not want to return to the role I left and want to return to a more junior role – how will my pay be affected?
If you want to return to a more junior role, you will still be paid the substantive rate for that role and should be paid at the top of the pay scale for that role.
What are the pension payment arrangements for staff returning to the NHS to assist in the response to the COVID-19 outbreak?
The government is bringing forward emergency legislation in response to the COVID-19 outbreak that contains important information on pension arrangements for extra NHS staff. It provides for the suspension of the 16-hour rule which currently prevents staff who return to work after retirement from the 1995 NHS Pension Scheme from working more than 16 hours per week, in the first four weeks after retirement. It also provides for:
The suspension of both the abatement for special class status holders in the 1995 Scheme
The requirement for staff in the 2008 Section and 2015 NHS Pension Scheme to reduce their pensionable pay by 10% if they elect to ‘draw down’ a portion of their benefits and continue working.
Taken together, these measures will allow skilled and experienced staff who have recently retired from the NHS to return to work, and retired staff who have already returned to work to increase their commitments if required, without having their pension benefits suspended.
When will these measures take effect?
The legislation will give the Government the power to immediately bring these measures into effect, if required.
What will happen when these measures are no longer needed?
A six-month notice period will be given to staff and employers before these measures will cease to apply, at which point the relevant sections of the scheme regulations will take effect again. Staff and employers will therefore have six months’ notice to readjust their working patterns.
The impact of pension tax on high-earning clinicians is a big issue and a barrier to extra capacity amongst existing NHS staff. What are you doing about that?
The Chancellor will do this via a tax solution, which involves:
Increasing annual allowance taper thresholds by £90,000 from 6 April 2020. The taxable pay threshold rises from £110,000 to £200,000 and adjusted income threshold from £150,000 to £240,000
Ensuring that the very highest earners pay their fair share of pension tax by reducing the minimum level to which the annual allowance can taper down from £10,000 to £4,000 (this will only affect those with a total income (including pension accrual) over £300,000).
Where will I be placed/could I be sent to another part of the country?
We want to make sure that we look after anyone who chooses to temporarily return to work. This may mean that you are placed with a remote or digital service, such as the Covid Response Service or 111, so you would not need to consider moving to a different area. In any instances where returning doctors are needed to deliver face to face service provision, where possible, you will be sent to a Trust or GP practice you have worked with before or are already linked with. There might be rare occasions where we would ask if you would consider moving to a different area to cover an acute workforce shortage, but this would of course be at your discretion and discussed with you beforehand.
Will I have insurance and indemnity cover?
Yes – arrangements are already in place to indemnify any professional working in a hospital trust or GP practice.
How will clinical indemnity cover for returning doctors work?
If engaged by an NHS trust to provide NHS services, individuals will be covered by the Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts. If engaged by a GP practice to provide NHS services, individuals will be covered by the Clinical Negligence Scheme for General Practice. It is envisaged that where retired GPs and other clinical staff are brought back to help in delivering NHS services for the purposes of dealing with the coronavirus outbreak that:
They will be covered under the CNST if they are engaged by an NHS trust to provide the NHS services (irrespective of where the services are provided – in hospital, a clinic or on GP premises), or
They will be covered by the CNSGP if they are engaged by a GP practice or Part 4 contractor to provide NHS services that are either:
Primary medical services (provided under a GP contract [Part 4 NHS Services Act 2006] – GMS/PMS/APMS)
Another type of NHS service provided as part of the activities of the GP practice.
These arrangements should cover existing and returning doctors for the vast majority of NHS services.
Where do I go for more advice and support about indemnity?
We recognise that returning doctors may also want to access to medico-legal advice and support, and it is the Government’s intention to ensure this is not a barrier to their return. We are engaging with providers of such advice and support to ensure it is available to returning doctors, who have provided the following information:
The Medical Protection Society (MPS) will provide professional indemnity protection to their non-practising or retired members returning to work on the COVID-19 response at no cost. More information for returning members wanting to take advantage of the Coronavirus Support protection should visit www.medicalprotection.org/uk/articles/information-for-retired-doctors.
Medical and Dental Defence Union of Scotland (MDDUS) will automatically provide professional indemnity protection at no cost to their retired members returning to work on the COVID-19 response and will write shortly to all who have retired in the last 3 years setting out details. There is no need for retired MDDUS members to contact the company to take advantage of this Coronavirus Support product, but information will be available at MDDUS.com or if needed on 0333 043 0000.
The Medical Defence Union (MDU) has confirmed that retired members returning to work specifically to help out as part of the COVID-19 response should visit themdu.com/coronavirus, when they are ready to start in their new role. Membership benefits for non-claims matters, such as help with complaints, GMC investigations or inquests, can then be made available if needed. Their membership team can be contacted on 0800 716 376 for any questions not covered on the site.
If I opt to see patients remotely, does this affect my indemnity?
Many doctors might have to consult with patients remotely more frequently than normal. In making the decision to consult and advise patients remotely, doctors must balance the risks and benefits and be satisfied that they can adequately clinically assess the patient remotely. Medical Defence Organisations (MDOs) advise doctors to make a record of the reasoning behind any decisions made and the information they give to patients in case they need to explain the approach they’ve taken later on.
Will I have to pay to go back onto the GMC register?
You won’t need to pay a fee to re-join the medical register.
Will I be expected to re-do an appraisal or re-validation process?
You won’t need to revalidate during while you hold temporary registration.
Do I need to be included on the NHS (England) Medical Performers List (the ‘List’) to work as an emergency registered practitioner (‘ERP’) in primary care?
Yes. If you are doctor a working in primary care, your name must be included on the List during the time defined by the Government as an emergency. If you’re a GP who has left the List in the preceding three years, NHS England will be contacting you to invite you to be reincluded by filling in a short form. This contact will be via the last known email address or mailing address. If you do not hear from NHS England and you wish to offer your services, please email england.erplists@nhs.net. Once forms have been received, NHS England will confirm your inclusion on the List as an ERP.
Any primary care provider looking to secure your skills will need to see evidence of this as part of the governance arrangements that they will need to comply with.
Your details will also be notified to Primary Care Support England who will be required to add your name to the List so that it will be available on the public facing List.
Once the state of emergency has ended, NHS England will write to you to confirm that your name will be removed from the List and your name will no longer be shown on the public facing list.
I have made an application to join the I&R scheme, can I be included on the List as an ERP?
Any GP that has successfully registered as an ERP can suspend their involvement in the I&R Scheme.
To do so, they should notify the GP National Recruitment Office (GPNRO) via iandr@hee.nhs.uk that they have registered as an emergency practitioner. The GPNRO will then put on hold any requirements in relation to the I&R Scheme.
Will I receive an induction process?
Yes – you will receive a fast track induction that will cover key mandatory training requirements, as well as more specific guidance, for example, on the management of coronavirus and use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Some of this would be led by NHS employers. There would also be ward/departmental level induction. If you are a GP, the provider or practice where you are deployed will be responsible for providing you with the necessary induction and clinical supervision, dependent on your individual requirements.
Will I need clearance from the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) – formerly the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB)?
Yes, though if you have a recent DBS Certificate or have maintained a subscription to the DBS Update Service then it may not be necessary for a further application to be submitted.
An assessment will be undertaken by your employing organisation, utilising guidance from NHS Employers, to determine if a further check is required.
Where a new DBS application is required, the DBS are proposing to extend the scope of their services to include a new fast track check against the adults and/children’s barred lists.
These arrangements will enable employers to recruit into a regulated activity in advance of receiving the full disclosure certificate, where they have undertaken a risk assessment and put in place appropriate monitoring and supervision.
You will not be required to pay for a DBS check.
I have a co-morbidity or am a primary carer, can I also work?
Given the increased risk of COVID-19 in those with co-morbidity and in the elderly population, we would of course advise against returning to patient-facing clinical work if you belong to this group. However, there are a range of opportunities in non-patient facing roles that we are in urgent need of support with.
I’ve accepted temporary registration. What will happen next? How will I find out where I’ll be working?
The GMC will pass information about you and your registration to NHSE and we will be in touch with you directly.
Will I be sent to multiple different practices/hospitals or stay in one role?
Ideally you will be placed in one role, but this cannot be guaranteed. Any proposed changes to your role would be discussed with you first.
Will I need to learn new skills?
Fast-track induction processes are being developed locally. This will include refreshing on old skills, such as death certification and prescribing, as well as new skills such as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) training. If you are a GP, the provider or the practice where you are deployed will be responsible for providing you with the necessary induction.
What if I become ill when I am working?
If you become ill while working, you should immediately inform your line manager and withdraw from work. If you think you may be ill due to covid-19 you should follow national guidance in place at the time (likely to be self-isolation).
What if I change my mind and don’t want to work anymore – who do I tell?
If you change your mind and don’t want to work anymore you should tell your line manager. A professional approach would be expected – for example not leaving in the middle of a shift.
Could I be asked to work in an area I am not familiar with?
As far as possible, we aim to match doctors to suitable specialties. In some situations, you may need to be placed in a different specialty according to service requirements. Where this is necessary, you will be supported adequately to take on these roles. Training and supervision will be given.
The GMC’s guidance should be followed as far as is practical in the circumstances, and provides a framework for ethical decision making in a wide range of situations.
I am working in an educational or research role, what are the next steps for me?
If you have a joint contract between clinical and educational/research roles, your organisation will contact you to discuss whether you are prepared to give up these activities in the short term (unless working on education or research in relation to COVID-19) to provide more clinical support in the workplace. Those with teaching expertise may be able to help provide induction for others including those returning doctors – for example, in the use of PPE, managing high flow oxygen or ventilated patients (if appropriately trained to do so).
I work in a part time clinical role, what are the next steps for me?
Discuss with your employers under what circumstances you should temporarily suspend your external commitments in order to provide more clinical support in your employing organisation. The balance between supporting front-line NHS services directly and delivering the business as usual work of the national bodies should be carefully balanced in each case.
What sort of work might I be expected to do? Will I have a choice?
There are multiple possible roles that you might be expected to take on including (but not limited to): contributing to the clinical part of the Covid Response Service or NHS111 service, death certification, backfill for clinicians dealing with acute respiratory patients, helping with outpatient clinics (this could be via telephone), supporting Out of Hours provision, seeing Emergency Department patients with acute non-respiratory presentations, providing elective treatment on ‘cold’ sites, training other clinicians, delivering remote consultations. Psychological and pastoral support will be available in the roles you take on.
How long will I be needed for?
You are likely to be needed for a short time period but at this stage, the exact length is unpredictable. You are free to stop working at any point. Contracts are likely to be drawn up for six months with the possibility for extension.
Will I have a contract?
Yes. You will have a contract that reflects all the working hour protections, pay arrangements, annual leave entitlement and inductions that are provided to new FY1 doctors.
What documentation do I need to have checked before I start work? Can this be done remotely?
Identify checks will be required but this will be a fast-track process with your local HR department.
Will I have a rota/need to work a specific number of hours?
You may be placed on a rota but this will be discussed with the organisation you will be placed in locally.
Will you check that I don’t have coronavirus?
If you develop symptoms, national guidance for testing will be followed.
What happens if I treat patients while having coronavirus?
As soon as coronavirus is identified in staff, they will be withdrawn from work and national guidance will be followed.
I haven’t been fit tested for the correct masks (FFP3)? Could I be asked to go into a room with a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19?
Clinicians preparing to assess a patient with suspected COVID-19 must wear PPE, which as a minimum should be:
A correctly fitted FFP3 respirator
Gown
Gloves
Eye protection.
Clinicians seeing patients with confirmed COVID-19 must wear full PPE comprising of:
A FFP3 respirator
Disposable eye protection (and preferably a visor)
A long sleeved disposable gown
Gloves.
For symptomatic, unconfirmed patients, clinicians should wear:
A fluid resistant surgical mask
Gloves
Apron
Eye protection if there is a risk of splashing into the eyes.
I’m pregnant or immunosuppressed. What rights do I have to protect myself from infection at work?
If you decide to return to work, a risk assessment will be conducted locally and you are advised to avoid COVID-19 exposure, which could mean redeployment to a non-frontline role where remote working is possible.
Is there specific advice for other high-risk chronic diseases?
People with chronic heart and lung disease have a higher risk of complications and higher mortality than the general population. We would not advise this group to return to directly face to face roles.
How can I decline if I am asked to work beyond my clinical competence?
If the epidemic worsens it is likely that doctors will have to work outside their normal field of practice. When deciding the safest and best course of action in the circumstances, doctors should consider factors including what is within their knowledge and skills; the protection and needs of all patients they have a responsibility towards; and minimising the risk of transmission and protecting their own health.

Medical Defence Organisations (MDOs) advise that any doctor faced with clinical duties outside their clinical competence should explain their concerns clearly to someone with responsibility for providing the service to determine the safest way to proceed. If they have done so and still feel uncomfortable, their MDO can advise them further.
The GMC’s guidance should be followed as far as is practical in the circumstances, and provides a framework for ethical decision making in a wide range of situations.
The GMC acknowledges that doctors may be anxious about context not being taken into account when concerns are raised about their actions in very challenging circumstances. Where a concern is raised about a registered professional, it will always be considered on the specific facts of the case, taking into account the factors relevant to the environment in which the professional is working.

Details
This guidance is intended for:
people with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, and do not require hospital treatment, who must remain at home until they are well
those living in households with someone who shows symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus
The main messages are:
if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. See ending isolation section for more information
if you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill
for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14-day isolation period. See ending isolation section for more information
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community
if you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period
if you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible
if you have coronavirus symptoms:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
you do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home
testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home
plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home and consider what can be done for vulnerable people in the household
ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home
wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water, or use hand sanitiser
if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.
If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111.

NHS England and NHS Improvement
5 March 2020
This is the first of a series of regular updates to general practice regarding the
emerging COVID-19 situation
Dear colleagues
I recognise that COVID-19 is placing a new and increasing challenge on already
busy practices, and this will be an area of concern for you, your teams and your
patients.
I would like to reassure you that we are continually refining our plans for this
outbreak, working with our key partners, and drawing on lessons learned from
previous incidents and listening to feedback received on emerging COVID-19 issues.
In this letter, I would like to update you on what is happening, and share some key
resources and how we plan to communicate with you.
As part of our preparedness plans, we will have advice and plans in place to
prioritise work to help manage increased pressure on the workforce, models to
care for vulnerable and self-isolating members of the public and staff, and
approaches to temporarily increase workforce capacity. Further details of these
arrangements will be announced as required.
What is happening?
It is important that you are kept safe and informed during this period. You can find
the latest guidance for keeping yourself safe and well here:
www.gov.uk/government/collections/wuhan-novel-coronavirus
We have recently published standard operating procedures for primary care:
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/. Please can you read through
these and take the actions requested. Public Health England has also issued interim
advice for primary care which you can also find on our website:
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
An initial stock of protective kit (PPE) for each practice, including 400 general use
aprons, 300 pairs of examination gloves and 300 fluid repellent face masks will be
issued early next week to all practices. Larger surgeries will receive repeat deliveries
to ensure they have sufficient amounts.
Major regulators have issued guidance to support health professionals in these
challenging circumstances, encouraging partnership working, flexibility and operating
in line with the best available guidance. You can read the statement here:
https://www.nmc.org.uk/news/news-and-updates/how-we-will-continue-to-regulate-
in-light-of-novel-coronavirus/ The Care Quality Commission is also working closely
http://www.gov.uk/government/collections/wuhan-novel-coronavirus
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
https://www.nmc.org.uk/news/news-and-updates/how-we-will-continue-to-regulate-in-light-of-novel-coronavirus/
https://www.nmc.org.uk/news/news-and-updates/how-we-will-continue-to-regulate-in-light-of-novel-coronavirus/
with NHS England and NHS Improvement and writing to providers today outlining
their plans.
We would like to encourage all practices to check their business continuity plans
(BCPs) and identify specific roles and actions that could support practices with
managing local demand. Ensuring your BCPs are common with your neighbours
(primary care network, neighbourhood or CCG) will allow additional support if
needed.
Changes to online booking: To mitigate any risk that potentially infected patients
book appointments online and attend the practice when they should be receiving
advice to self-isolate or go through testing, all practices are now being advised to
change face-to-face appointments booked online to triage appointments via
telephone or video. You can read more on our website:
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
Prescriptions: Practices should not change their repeat prescription durations or
support patients trying to stockpile: these actions may put a strain on the supply
chain and exacerbate any potential shortages. Practices should consider putting all
suitable patients on electronic repeat dispensing as soon as possible. The whole
repeatable prescription can be valid for a year but each repeat should be for no
longer than the patient has now. For example, if the patient has prescriptions for a
month’s supply now then the repeat dispensing should be set up as 13 x 28 days’
supply.
Useful resources
You can download the latest materials to display to the public on our website:
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/. This will soon include posters
for GP practices that need to close for cleaning. On the same link you can also find
new wording for practice websites and other communications channels.
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
Our current standard patient guidance is as follows:
The latest information on symptoms of coronovirus infection and areas where recent
travel may have resulted in a high risk of exposure can be found on
https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/.
NHS 111 has an online coronavirus service that can tell you if you need medical help
and advise you what to do.
Use this service if:
• you think you might have coronavirus
• in the last 14 days you've been to a country or area with a high risk of
coronavirus
• you've been in close contact with someone with coronavirus.
Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. Call 111
if you need to speak to
someone.
Everyone is being reminded to follow the public health advice on the NHS website to
avoid catching or spreading coronavirus.
Please bookmark the dedicated NHS England and NHS Improvement COVID-19
web page https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/ that includes
important updates for the NHS including primary care providers (including general
practice, community pharmacy, dental and optical providers).
If you need any COVID-19 specific public health advice which is not already
covered in published guidance, please contact your Local Health Protection Unit or
your local commissioner.
How we plan to communicate with you
1. Urgent messages: Central Alerting System:
• For urgent patient safety communications, we will contact you through the Central
Alerting System (CAS).
• Please ensure you have registered to receive CAS alerts directly from the MHRA:
https://www.cas.mhra.gov.uk/Register.aspx
Practice action: Please use a generic practice email account, not a personal one.
For continuity of access, ideally use an nhs.net email account – it’s more secure.
Please register a mobile phone number for emergency communications.
2. At less urgent times: Commissioner’s cascade:
• For less urgent COVID-19 communications we will email you through your local
commissioner.
Practice action: Please share a dedicated nhs.net COVID-19 generic practice email
with your commissioner to receive communications and also share this email with
your local medical committee. In the event of user absence, practices should ensure
auto forward for emails to an alternative nhs.net account and designated deputy.

Supportive additional information
We will host a targeted webinar to discuss the support in place for colleagues and
patients in managing COVID-19, and details will be announced shortly via this
update and through your regional teams.
We will use a variety of additional methods to keep you informed of the emerging
situation, alongside Royal Colleges, regulators and professional bodies, and through
formal and informal networks including social and wider media. You can follow these
Twitter accounts to keep up to date:
• NHS England and NHS Improvement @NHSEngland
• Department of Health and Social Care @DHSC
• Public Health England @PHE_uk
Thank you for your understanding and continuing support, it is very much
appreciated.
Yours sincerely

What to do if you have symptoms
Stay at home for 7 days if you have either:
a high temperature
a new continuous cough
if you live with other people, they should stay at home for 14 days from the day the first person got symptoms.
This will help to protect others in your community while you are infectious.
Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.
You do not need to contact NHS 111 to tell them you’re staying at home.
Testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home.
Read the guidance about staying at home.

As of 9am, 233 patients in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) have died.
Cases identified in England
Confirmed cases in each local authority and NHS region are published by Public Health England (PHE).
Risk level
The risk to the UK has been raised to high.
Recent government action
The government published its coronavirus action plan on 3 March.
On 10 February, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, announced strengthened legal powers to protect public health.
The Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 have been put in place to reduce the risk of further human-to-human transmission in this country by keeping individuals in isolation where public health professionals believe there is a reasonable risk an individual may have the virus.

Dear colleague
GUIDANCE ON SUPPLY AND USE OF PPE
We are setting out, in a single document, everything that you need to know on the
supply and use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
1. Supplies you will be receiving
We have now moved to providing substantial extra deliveries and support will be
available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Services across the NHS are urgently
being sent stocks of PPE to help them manage cases and potential cases of COVID-
19 and keep staff safe. See section 6 for details of equipment being sent.
• On Thursday 2.6 million face masks and 10,000 hand sanitisers went to trusts
in London.
• On Friday 150 hospital trusts will have extra PPE kit delivered. Over the
weekend every other hospital trust will receive a further special delivery of
PPE.
• Every GP practice, dental practice and community pharmacy has now had a
PPE delivery.
• All care homes, hospices, and home care providers will have a PPE delivery,
and these began earlier this week.
To meet your needs, we are putting on substantial extra deliveries. We will aim to
deliver these in usual working hours but, given the volume of deliveries, please
ensure your organisation is prepared to receive some deliveries at evenings and
weekends.
2. Reporting supply disruption
The supply distribution helpline can answer PPE calls and emails 24/7 via the supply
disruption helpline on 0800 915 9964 or email
supplydisruptionservice@nhsbsa.nhs.uk to help with queries. Emails will be
answered within one hour.
Trusts should raise non-PPE orders with NHS Supply Chain in the usual way.
3. Securing additional supplies from manufacturers
COVID-19 is generating unprecedented global demand on the supply chain,
combined with a manufacturing slowdown in affected countries, especially China
which manufactures a large amount of PPE.
Government, NHS Supply Chain, and the NHS are doing everything to work with
industry to secure additional supplies and manufacture further PPE.
4. Shelf life of PPE items
The NHS’s stockpiled PPE is checked as part of the stock management process
operated through the NHS Supply Chain. This means rotating stock to make sure
that items which have been there the longest are issued first.
Some products may appear to have out-of-date ‘use by/expiration’ dates or have
relabelled ‘use by/expiration’ dates. Please be assured products being issued have
passed stringent tests that demonstrate they are safe. The PPE is exposed to
extreme conditions for prolonged periods, to see how the product deteriorates. All
that are not up to standard are destroyed and not distributed to trusts.
We have been working with independent test facilities and the Health and Safety
Executive (HSE) who, after being provided with scientific evidence, were content
with our assessment that these are safe to use by NHS staff.
5. Correct use of PPE
NHS England and NHS Improvement collates all advice to clinical staff, including
safe systems of working including the of use PPE, online here:
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/
mailto:supplydisruptionservice@nhsbsa.nhs.uk
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/
The full COVID-19 guidance collection is available at
https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-covid-19-list-of-guidance
6. Putting on PPE and fit test training
Public Health England (PHE) recommended PPE ensemble for healthcare workers
within a metre of a patient with possible or confirmed COVID-19 is:
• Fluid repellent facemask
• Apron
• Gloves
• Eye protection if there is a risk of splashing
The recommended PPE ensemble to be used for aerosol generating procedures on
patients with possible or confirmed COVID-19 is:
• FFP3 respirator
• Long sleeved disposable gown
• Gloves
• Eye protection (disposable goggles or full-face visor)
Some healthcare workers will not have worn items like FFP3 respirators before. To
protect their safety, we are asking trusts to ensure that all relevant staff have
received the necessary fit test training.
PHE has engaged with RPA (an independent Respiratory Protective Equipment
(RPE) fit testing company) who are running fit-test training sessions via webinars to
help staff who will be training to use Qualitative or Quantitive fit test methods for
FFP3 respirators for the first time or those seeking refresher training to ensure they
are able to train FFP3 users safely. Booking on to these courses is via RPA’s
helpline on 07947 968972 and 07947 968922. This training is free.
The linked Public Health England poster is intended as a guide for staff about how to
put on PPE, including FFP3 respirators.
A YouTube video is also available here: https://youtu.be/kKz_vNGsNhc
7. Disposing of PPE correctly
All PPE that is used when encountering confirmed cases of COVID-19 is single-use
only and should be changed immediately after each patient and/or following
completion of a procedure or task.
PPE should be disposed of after use into the correct waste stream i.e.
healthcare/clinical waste (this will require disposal via orange or yellow bag waste).
There might be further local guidance depending on the impact of the disease.

guidance on doing this safely is shared with staff.

Details
This guidance is intended for:
people with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, and do not require hospital treatment, who must remain at home until they are well
those living in households with someone who shows symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus
The main messages are:
if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. See ending isolation section for more information
if you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill
for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14-day isolation period. See ending isolation section for more information
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community
if you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period
if you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible
if you have coronavirus symptoms:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
you do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home
testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home
plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home and consider what can be done for vulnerable people in the household
ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home
wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water, or use hand sanitiser
if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.
If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111.

Details
This guidance is intended for:
people with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, and do not require hospital treatment, who must remain at home until they are well
those living in households with someone who shows symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus
The main messages are:
if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. See ending isolation section for more information
if you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill
for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14-day isolation period. See ending isolation section for more information
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community
if you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period
if you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible
if you have coronavirus symptoms:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
you do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home

if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.

Events are time-stamped on the date that PHE was informed of the new case or death.
The map shows circles that grow or shrink in line with the number of cases in that geographic area.
Data from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are represented on the charts, total indicators and on the country level map layer.

Wherever you can help, your NHS needs you
Thank you for your interest in helping the NHS fight COVID-19. The virus has the potential to put huge additional demand on our NHS and our fellow citizens. Your support will make more of a difference than ever before, not just to patients, but to colleagues and the wider community.
If you have retired from the NHS in the last three years, your regulator will be emailing you to outline next steps.
If you have previously left the NHS – either temporarily or permanently – or a member of the public who would like to help on a voluntary basis, we’ll be keeping these pages updated as frequently as possible, so please watch this space.
We will also be making announcements via the media, including social media.
Even if you fall into a group which is considered to be at increased risk, you can still offer valuable support through a variety of roles in secondary, community and primary care that are not patient-facing.
Thank you for your interest in helping the NHS fight against coronavirus.
Returning nurses and midwives
If you wish to join the Covid-19 temporary register as a nurse or midwife please visit the NMC’s website and complete their application form. You can find answers to some frequently asked questions here.

Details
This guidance is intended for:
people with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, and do not require hospital treatment, who must remain at home until they are well
those living in households with someone who shows symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus
The main messages are:
if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. See ending isolation section for more information
if you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill
for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14-day isolation period. See ending isolation section for more information
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community
if you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period
if you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible
if you have coronavirus symptoms:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
you do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home
testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home
plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home and consider what can be done for vulnerable people in the household
ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home
wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water, or use hand sanitiser
if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.
If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111.

What to do if you have symptoms
Stay at home for 7 days if you have either:
a high temperature
a new continuous cough
if you live with other people, they should stay at home for 14 days from the day the first person got symptoms.
This will help to protect others in your community while you are infectious.
Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.
You do not need to contact NHS 111 to tell them you’re staying at home.
Testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home.
Read the guidance about staying at home.
Number of cases
As of 9am on 21 March 2020, 72,818 people have been tested in the UK, of which 67,800 were confirmed negative and 5,018 were confirmed positive.
As of 9am, 233 patients in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) have died.
Cases identified in England
Confirmed cases in each local authority and NHS region are published by Public Health England (PHE).
Risk level
The risk to the UK has been raised to high.
Recent government action
The government published its coronavirus action plan on 3 March.
On 10 February, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, announced strengthened legal powers to protect public health.
The Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 have been put in place to reduce the risk of further human-to-human transmission in this country by keeping individuals in isolation where public health professionals believe there is a reasonable risk an individual may have the virus.

Details
This guidance outlines infection control for healthcare providers assessing possible cases of COVID-19. It should be used in conjunction with local policies.
In the absence of effective drugs or a vaccine, control of this disease relies on the prompt identification, appropriate risk assessment, management and isolation of possible and confirmed cases, and the investigation and follow up of close contacts to minimise potential onward transmission.
This video shows how to safely don (put on) PPE specific to COVID-19 and should be used in conjunction with the quick guide to donning PPE and local policies.

Details
This guidance is intended for:
people with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, and do not require hospital treatment, who must remain at home until they are well
those living in households with someone who shows symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus
The main messages are:
if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. See ending isolation section for more information
if you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill
for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14-day isolation period. See ending isolation section for more information
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community
if you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period
if you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible
if you have coronavirus symptoms:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
you do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home
testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home
plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home and consider what can be done for vulnerable people in the household
ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home
wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water, or use hand sanitiser
if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.
If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111.

Coronavirus (COVID-19)
March 2020
COVID-19 is a new illness. Lots
of people call it Coronavirus.
It can affect your lungs and your
airways.
Most people who get Coronavirus
will not be very ill.
Some older people or people who
already have health problems
may become more ill.
You may feel worried about
Coronavirus. This is normal.
Talk about how you feel with
people you can trust.
Coronavirus (COVID-19) – Easy read

We have a plan to slow down
how fast Coronavirus spreads.
There are things everyone can do
to help stop them and other
people getting Coronavirus.
1) Keep your hands clean.
Wash your hands lots of times
during the day:
use soap and water
use hand sanitiser (gel) if there is
no soap and water when you are out
make sure you wash your hands
when:
• you come home
• you visit other places
• before you touch food
Do not touch your eyes, nose
or mouth
Coronavirus (COVID-19) – Easy read
3
Always cough and sneeze into
a tissue.
Then throw the tissue away
and wash your hands.
2) Be ready to stay at home
Stay at home and don’t meet up
with other people for 7 days if you
have Coronavirus symptoms.
These are:
• a new cough, and you keep
coughing or
• a high temperature
After 7 days, if you feel better, you
can start your usual routine again.
Stay at home and don’t meet up
with other people for 14 days if
you share your home with
someone who has symptoms of
Coronavirus.

3) Make a plan
Think about what you will do if you
are asked to stay at home.
If you have support from family or
paid carers you should make a
plan with them.
4) Only use health services
when it is important to do so.
If you:
• are staying at home and
start to feel much more ill
or
• have stayed at home for 7
days and still have
symptoms of Coronavirus
then:
• get advice from NHS 111
online
• if you need to speak to
someone call 111
• you should not go to a GP
surgery, pharmacy or
hospital as you could pass
Coronavirus to others
Only dial 999 or go to Accident
and Emergency if there is an
emergency.

Dear Colleague,
We are writing to ask for your help with the management and shielding of patients
who are at the highest risk of severe morbidity and mortality from coronavirus
(COVID-19).
On Monday 16th March the UK government announced a package of measures,
advising those who are or may be at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19
to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures.
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-
and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-
protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults
This group has been identified to the public as those who are:
• aged 70 or older (regardless of medical conditions)
• under 70 with an underlying health condition listed below (i.e. anyone
instructed to get a flu jab as an adult each year on medical grounds):
• chronic (long-term) respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema or bronchitis
• chronic heart disease, such as heart failure
• chronic kidney disease
• chronic liver disease, such as hepatitis
• chronic neurological conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, motor neurone
disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), a learning disability or cerebral palsy
• diabetes
• problems with your spleen – for example, sickle cell disease or if you have
had your spleen removed
• a weakened immune system as the result of conditions such as HIV and
AIDS, or medicines such as steroid tablets or chemotherapy
• being seriously overweight (a BMI of 40 or above)
• those who are pregnant
This wider group, who broadly speaking comprise the criteria of adults eligible for an
annual flu vaccine, will not be proactively contacted but have instead been asked to
take steps to reduce their social interactions in order to reduce the transmission of
coronavirus.
There is a subset of this group who have clinical conditions which are likely to put
people at the highest risk of mortality and severe morbidity from COVID-19. We have
identified this group, based on expert consensus. More detailed information about
your essential role in this process is outlined in attached letter from Dr Nikita Kanani
and Ed Waller.
Given the difficulties of identifying those most vulnerable for some

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults

patients, in some cases this is going to require some clinical judgements by you
about your patients. You may know of specific additional patients in your practice
who you think are particularly high risk. On the other hand there are a limited number
of people that we can shield effectively or for whom this highly socially isolating
measure would be proportionate on health grounds; many patients who fulfil the
criteria may after discussion with you prefer not to be placed under such strict
isolation for what will be a prolonged period.
Further broad information about the
methodology we followed to identify this group is contained in Annex 1.
We recognise the significant pressures that GP practices are under, which the
necessity to self-isolate staff where they have symptoms compatible with coronavirus
has inevitably made more acute. We also know the changing pace of guidance and
requests that we make of you in support of your patients, as a result of the need to
address this new global pandemic, are significant. We massively appreciate all the
efforts GPs and other primary care staff are making, and will make, to care for
patients and communities at this difficult time, and know the public does as well. A
letter from Nikki Kanani and Ed Waller has been issued on the 19 March outlining
the current situation and highlighting the work that can be stopped in general
practice. A further letter from Nikki and Ed to support this process is attached in
annex 2.
Please accept our sincere thanks for your expertise, help, patience and support at
this challenging time.
Kind regards,
Professor Stephen Powis

Chief Medical Officer for England
Annex 1 – Identification of Vulnerable Groups: Methods
This annex explains the basis of the latest advice that has been sent to all patients
who are considered to be at highest risk of mortality and severe morbidity from
coronavirus (COVID-19). Emerging clinical data about COVID-19 indicated that the
death rate would be high for groups of people with particular chronic diseases. The
modelling suggests that if we were able to effectively shield these people it would
have a significant positive effect on the fatality rate in that group and overall (but a
modest effect on the overall curve). This group has therefore been recommended to
undertake shielding measures for their own protection.
In order to be effective these people would have to undergo strict social isolation with
no contact from the outside world beyond that absolutely necessary, for a period of
at least 12 weeks. A move which will significantly impact quality of life, increase
social isolation, and would not be without its own attendant physical and mental
health risks. We therefore drew up a list of conditions which we felt would justify
affected individuals taking such extreme measures. This group are a subset of a
wider more generally vulnerable group (broadly any adult eligible for an annual flu
vaccine), who have already been advised to follow social distancing measures to
reduce their number of contacts for a period of at least 12 weeks.
We developed a four pronged approach towards ensuring coverage across affected
groups by 1) identifying a core group of patients to be contacted centrally by NHS
England; 2) providing guidance to medical subspecialties in
secondary care and
asking them to identify and contact additional patients in their caseload who fall
under Group 1 category 5; 3) working with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges
to cascade general guidance for hospital specialties to help them identify and contact
further high risk patients from their caseload; 4) working with RCGP to issue
guidance to GPs to help them identify and contact high risk patients from their own
caseload (for example those with severe multimorbidity).
Group 1
We took the following steps when drawing up the list of patients who can be
identified centrally by extracting relevant groups from national datasets:
a) NHS England Clinical Reference Groups (groups of experts who advise the
NHS on Direct Commissioning) were asked to consider which conditions
would put patients at intermediate, high or very high risk of severe morbidity
or mortality from COVID-19
b) Based on our current understanding and specialist and wider advice senior
clinicians (NHSE, NHS Digital, PHE, CMO, DCMOs) categorised these
conditions into the following high risk groups (see below)
1. Solid organ transplant recipients
2. People with specific cancers
• People with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radical
radiotherapy for lung cancer
• People with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia,
lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment
• People having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments
for cancer
• People having other targeted cancer treatments which can affect the
immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors.
• People who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last
6 months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs.
3. People with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic
fibrosis, severe asthma and severe COPD
4. People with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that
significantly increase the risk of infections (such as SCID,
homozygous sickle cell disease)
5. People on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly
increase risk of infection
6. People who are pregnant with significant heart disease, congenital or
acquired
Group 2
There are some patients on this list who will be contacted by other routes due to
limitations in national datasets. For example, Cancer Units will contact all patients in
category 2; secondary care will contact most of the patients in category 5 via a
cascade from the Royal College of Physicians and associated medical societies
Group 3
In addition, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges will ask its members to identify
any other subgroups of patients they feel are at high risk, and will cascade templates
to hospital specialists. We will ask clinicians who have identified these patients to let
them know directly using a standard letter containing the information they need to
commence shielding and access support. We will ask hospital specialists to inform
the GP of the decision to include patients in the vulnerable group.
Group 4
In addition, we will issue GPs with specific guidance around identification of high risk
patients with complex / severe multimorbidity and ask the GP to contact these
groups directly to recommend they are considered for inclusion in the shielding
group.
We accept that given this is a new and rapidly moving disease there are inevitable
limitations in our methodology but have designed the most robust approach that was
possible at pace with the aim of identifying the maximum number of vulnerable
individuals in sufficient time to effectively shield this group.",428931ce-8374-4d90-8b78-9916b1de146f.pdf

What to do if you have symptoms
Stay at home for 7 days if you have either:
a high temperature
a new continuous cough
if you live with other people, they should stay at home for 14 days from the day the first person got symptoms.
This will help to protect others in your community while you are infectious.
Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.
You do not need to contact NHS 111 to tell them you’re staying at home.
Testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home.
Read the guidance about staying at home.

The government published its coronavirus action plan on 3 March.
On 10 February, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, announced strengthened legal powers to protect public health.
The Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 have been put in place to reduce the risk of further human-to-human transmission in this country by keeping individuals in isolation where public health professionals believe there is a reasonable risk an individual may have the virus.

COVID-19: NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme
19 March 2020
Dear all
Following the announcement of social distancing recommendations to help prevent
the spread of COVID-19, we are writing to set out temporary changes to the delivery
of the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme (NHS DPP).
Recommendations to limit unnecessary social contact mean that group-based face-
to-face delivery of the NHS DPP is no longer in line with government advice. As
such, we will stop delivering group-based face-to-face services on Friday 20
March 2020.
We have worked with NHS DPP providers to make temporary arrangements for the
continued delivery of the programme using fully remote arrangements. While each
provider’s remote offer will have subtle differences, all will have no in-person face-to-
face contact – for example, using telephone-based coaching. Alongside this we will
continue to offer digital services, again without in-person face-to-face contact. This
will ensure that all NHS DPP delivery is in line with government advice.
There may be temporary disruption in the flow of sessions to active participants as
providers move from a face-to-face to remote delivery model. We will work with
providers during this time to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible and to
minimise disruption to people participating in the programme.
• For participants who have already begun group-based face-to-face services, any
further in-person sessions will be cancelled from Friday 20 March 2020, and they
will move to a remote delivery model, following the same curriculum.
• Participants who have already begun the digital service will continue as planned.
• Participants who have not started a programme yet, or who are referred over the
coming months, will be offered a remote or digital programme. This will include a
phone option for those who are not digitally enabled.
• For participants who decline remote delivery and express a preference for face-
to-face groups, there will be the option of waiting until normal face-to-face
delivery is resumed, and they will not be discharged in the interim.
Next steps
• Providers will communicate details of their revised delivery arrangements with
you over the coming days, and we will amend contracts with providers to support
these alternative arrangements.
• Providers will tell participants about the cancellation of in-person sessions and
arrangements for establishing new remote sessions. Providers are asked to
share communications with site leads.

About accessibility
About accessibility
If you encounter any accessibility issues with this website, please let us know at england.web@england.nhs.uk.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the accessibility of third party websites, documents and multimedia content that we may link to.
What is accessibility and why does it matter?
To be accessible the NHS England website must be as easy to use and understand for as many visitors as possible. This website complies with the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) Level AA guidelines for accessibility and we are committed to maintaining and improving the accessibility of our site.
Text size
Can I change the font size used on the website?
Yes. This may be useful for you if you have low vision and need larger font sizes.
On a PC: from Internet Explorer select the View menu at the top of your window, scroll down and select the Text size option.
On an Apple Mac: from Safari select Preferences from the Edit menu at the top of the window. From there, click on Web content and uncheck the Show style sheets option. Then return to the list of preferences and choose Web browser. Then click on Language/fonts and choose the size you need.
Text colour
Can I change the font colours used on the website?
Yes. This may be useful for you if you have low vision and need high contrast colours. You can change the style and colour, and choose an alternative colour for links. You can also change background and foreground colours.
To ignore font and background colours in Internet Explorer on a PC, choose Internet options from the Tools menu at the top of the window. On the general tab of the window that appears, click the Accessibility button. This takes you to a menu where you can choose to ignore the way the page is formatted. To set your colour and font preferences, return to the Internet options menu and use the Colours and Fonts buttons.
Keyboard navigation
Do I have to use a mouse to navigate the NHS England website?
No. Use your arrow keys to scroll up or down the page. You can use your Tab key to move between links, and press Return or Enter to select one. To go back to the previous page, use the Backspace key.
PDF accessibility
We try to make sure that PDF documents on the NHS England website are as accessible as possible.
If you are having problems accessing a particular document, please let us know at england.web@england.nhs.uk.
Is there anything I can do to make PDF documents more accessible?
Useful information about services to make Acrobat documents more accessible is provided on Adobe’s website.
Further information can be found on Adobe pages on accessibility.
Downloading documents
What formats are downloadable documents provided in?
Downloadable documents on the NHS England site are provided in a variety of formats. The most common are PDF, Word and Excel. If you require a document in an alternative format, please contact us at england.web@england.nhs.uk.
What if I don’t have the software to open the document?
Most computers already have the software to open these document formats. If you do not have Adobe Acrobat Reader (for reading PDFs), it is available from the Adobe site.
How do I save documents to my computer?
If you have a PC, right-click on the link to the document. If you use a Macintosh, hold down the mouse button over the link. In both cases, a popup menu will then appear. Scroll down the menu and click on ‘Save target as’. You will then be asked to choose a folder on your computer where you can save the document.
Some browsers such as Firefox and Chrome automatically download documents to your computer when you open them.
Video accessibility
Are NHS England videos accessible?
Videos on the NHS England website are generally accompanied by closed captions. If this is not the case, please contact us at england.web@england.nhs.uk to request a text alternative. Don’t forget to let us know which video you are interested in.

Coronavirus (COVID-19)
Contents
Overview
Stay at home advice
COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways. It's caused by a virus called coronavirus.
Stay at home if you have coronavirus symptoms
Stay at home if you have either:
a high temperature – this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)
a new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual)
To protect others, do not go to places like a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. Stay at home.
Use the 111 online coronavirus service to find out what to do.
Use the 111 coronavirus service
Information:
Only call 111 if you cannot get help online.
How long to stay at home
if you have symptoms of coronavirus, you'll need to stay at home for 7 days
if you live with someone who has symptoms, you'll need to stay at home for 14 days from the day the first person in the home started having symptoms
If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.
If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.
Read our advice about staying at home.
How to avoid catching and spreading coronavirus (social distancing)
Everyone should do what they can to stop coronavirus spreading.
Do
wash your hands with soap and water often – do this for at least 20 seconds
always wash your hands when you get home or into work
use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available
cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze
put used tissues in the bin immediately and wash your hands afterwards
avoid close contact with people who have symptoms of coronavirus
only travel on public transport if you need to
work from home, if you can
avoid social activities, such as going to pubs, restaurants, theatres and cinemas
avoid events with large groups of people
use phone, online services, or apps to contact your GP surgery or other NHS services
Don't
do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean
do not have visitors to your home, including friends and family
Advice for people at high risk
If you're at high risk of getting seriously ill from coronavirus, there are extra things you should do to avoid catching it.
These include:
not leaving your home – you should not go out to do shopping, visit friends or family, or attend any gatherings
avoiding close contact with other people in your home as much as possible
Read the full advice on protecting yourself if you're at high risk from coronavirus on GOV.UK.
Who is at high risk?
You may be at high risk from coronavirus if you:
have had an organ transplant
are having certain types of cancer treatment
have blood or bone marrow cancer, such as leukaemia
have a severe lung condition, such as cystic fibrosis or severe asthma
have a condition that makes you much more likely to get infections
are taking medicine that weakens your immune system
are pregnant and have a serious heart condition

If you're at high risk, you will be contacted by the NHS by Sunday 29 March 2020. Do not contact your GP or healthcare team at this stage – wait to be contacted.
How coronavirus is spread
Because it's a new illness, we do not know exactly how coronavirus spreads from person to person.
Similar viruses are spread in cough droplets.
It's very unlikely it can be spread through things like packages or food.
Pregnancy advice
If you're pregnant and worried about coronavirus, you can get advice about coronavirus and pregnancy from the Royal College of Obstretricians and Gynaecologists.
Travel advice
There are some countries and areas where there's a higher chance of coming into contact with someone with coronavirus.
If you're planning to travel abroad and are concerned about coronavirus, see advice for travellers on GOV.UK.
Treatment for coronavirus
There is currently no specific treatment for coronavirus.
Antibiotics do not help, as they do not work against viruses.
Treatment aims to relieve the symptoms while your body fights the illness.
You'll need to stay in isolation, away from other people, until you have recovered.

Before you go
When you’re abroad
Before you go
check our travel advice for the country you are visiting. Sign up for email alerts to get the latest updates
follow @FCOtravel on Twitter and like our Facebook page
find out where your nearest British embassy or consulate will be, in case you need to contact them in an emergency
tell family and friends where you’re going and leave them your contact details, insurance policy details and itinerary. Store them securely online
ensure you have access to funds to cover emergencies and unexpected delays. Take more than one means of payment with you (cash, debit card, credit card)
find out if travellers cheques are appropriate for your destination and keep a separate record of their numbers
invest in a good travel guide to help you plan your trip and consider using online travel forums for more detail about your destination
check with your service provider to make sure your phone works abroad. Consider leaving your phone’s IMEI number with a friend or family member, to help block or locate the phone if there’s a problem
if you’re going to be driving abroad, make sure your licence is current and valid and be aware of the driving laws in the country you are visiting
if you’re travelling with children who are unaccompanied by one or both parents, check our guidance on permissions that you might need to get and check the policy of your airline or transport provider
Entry requirements, visas and passports
check the entry requirements of the country you’re travelling to
make sure you’ve got correct visas for the country you’re visiting and that your passport is valid
for some countries your passport must be valid for 6 months after the date you travel. Check the requirements for passport validity in our travel advice
if you’re applying for a passport for the first time, you need to attend an interview at HM Passport Office to verify your identity. It takes up to six weeks to get a first passport. More information
make a note of your passport number and take a photocopy with you, or store it securely online
fill in the emergency contact details in your passport. This will help government officials to contact next of kin if you have an accident
Insurance
get travel insurance and make sure it covers you for any activities you are likely to do, including extreme or water sports
if you’re travelling within the European Economic Area and Switzerland you can get a free European Health Insurance Card for free or reduced emergency care. You still need travel insurance to cover loss or damage to personal items
phone 112 to contact the emergency services in any EU country
Health
At least 8 weeks before your trip, check the latest country-specific health advice from the Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)
General information on travel vaccinations and a travel health checklist is available on the NHS website
If required, contact your health adviser or pharmacy for advice on other preventive measures and managing any pre-existing medical conditions while you’re abroad
Take enough medical supplies for the duration of your visit and any unexpected delays
The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in the UK can be different in other countries. For further information, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to
Further guidance can be found in best practice when travelling with medicines
When you’re abroad
think about what you are doing at all times and trust your instincts. Don’t take risks that you wouldn’t in the UK
don’t openly display valuables such as mobile phones or digital cameras and consider using a padlock on suitcases or backpacks
find out how to minimise your risk from terrorism and what to do if there’s a terrorist attack
find out about local customs and dress, behave accordingly and obey local laws. There may be serious penalties for breaking a law that might seem trivial at home
be careful when taking photographs, videos or using binoculars. These activities may be misunderstood by local authorities, especially near military installations.
store useful numbers on your phone such as the local police and the nearest British embassy or consulate
whether you’re living abroad or visiting, be aware of the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning, just as you would in the UK; the ‘Be Alarmed’ campaign gives practical advice on how to stay safe and lists the symptoms to look out for
if you intend to take part in any adventure sports or water sports during your trip, only use properly licensed and insured operators. Before taking part, make sure you fully understand the operating instructions and satisfy yourself that adequate safety precautions are in place
check import regulations for food and plants before you attempt to bring them back to the UK

What to do if you have symptoms
Stay at home for 7 days if you have either:
a high temperature
a new continuous cough
if you live with other people, they should stay at home for 14 days from the day the first person got symptoms.
This will help to protect others in your community while you are infectious.
Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.
You do not need to contact NHS 111 to tell them you’re staying at home.
Testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home.
Read the guidance about staying at home.
Number of cases
As of 9am on 21 March 2020, 72,818 people have been tested in the UK, of which 67,800 were confirmed negative and 5,018 were confirmed positive.
As of 9am, 233 patients in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) have died.
Cases identified in England
Confirmed cases in each local authority and NHS region are published by Public Health England (PHE).
Risk level
The risk to the UK has been raised to high.
Recent government action
The government published its coronavirus action plan on 3 March.
On 10 February, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, announced strengthened legal powers to protect public health.
The Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 have been put in place to reduce the risk of further human-to-human transmission in this country by keeping individuals in isolation where public health professionals believe there is a reasonable risk an individual may have the virus.

General
There may be legal notices elsewhere on GOV.UK that relate to how you use the site.

Details
This guidance is intended for:
people with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, and do not require hospital treatment, who must remain at home until they are well
those living in households with someone who shows symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus
The main messages are:
if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. See ending isolation section for more information
if you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill
for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14-day isolation period. See ending isolation section for more information
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community
if you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period
if you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible
if you have coronavirus symptoms:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
you do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home
testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home
plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home and consider what can be done for vulnerable people in the household
ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home
wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water, or use hand sanitiser
if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.
If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111.
For a medical emergency dial 999

FAQs for returning as temporarily registered nurses and midwives
Wherever you can help, you’re needed
As a highly skilled, experienced nurse or midwifery professional who may have temporarily or permanently left the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) register, we are seeking your support to join the fight against COVID-19. There are a number of different ways you can support the existing NHS workforce and local communities that include both direct and non-direct care.
COVID-19 has the potential to put huge additional demand on our NHS and health care systems so in response the government is granting emergency powers to allow the NMC to award temporary registration to certain groups of suitably experienced people. This includes nurse and midwives who have voluntarily left the register within recent years and may wish to return to practice. By offering to return, you can make a significant difference, not just to patients and those we care for, but to colleagues and the wider community we serve.
This isn’t only about clinically treating those with COVID-19. Members of the general public may feel anxious and welcome reassurance as a highly respected and experience healthcare professional. Your expertise may be able to offer help and support in so many ways through a wide range of valuable roles and in a range of settings.
We greatly appreciate the time and effort that you have already given as a nurse and/or midwife and you should be assured we are taking steps to make returning to practice as easy and safe as possible for you should you wish to do so.
If you wish to re-join the workforce please complete this survey to help understand how best to use your skills and begin this process.
We have aimed to answer many of these here but if you have any further queries, do please contact nhsi.nursing.returners@nhs.net or nhsi.midwives.returners@nhs.net as appropriate.
Your expertise and experience will be valued beyond measure in these challenging times.
Thank you.
Questions you may be considering
What is the COVID-19 temporary register?
The temporary register will come into force if the Secretary of State for Health and Care declares a state of emergency. At that point, if you have told the NMC that you’d be willing to join the temporary register and completed the ‘opt-in’ form, your details will be passed on to those leading the UKs health services.
As with the permanent register, your registration will be listed on its website. If you haven’t been contacted by the NMC to join the temporary register and feel you should have, visit: https://www.nmc.org.uk/news/coronavirus/temporary-registration/
What does re-registration mean? Do I need to do anything to re-register with the NMC?
As we are responding to an emergency, you will not be asked to meet the same requirements as if you were re-joining the register in a non-emergency situation. All registration requirements have been waived if you are joining the COVID-19 temporary register under the emergency registration legislation.
That means you won’t need to have practised for a minimum number of hours in the last three years and you won’t need to pay a registration fee.
Is returning to work voluntary?
Yes, this process is completely voluntary. Wherever and however you can help, you’re needed, and we would be extremely grateful for any support that you are able to offer. However, if you choose not to join on the temporary register there will be details within the NMC letter you receive as to what you need to do next to ‘opt-out’. Of course, opting out will not be detrimental to future employment or career opportunities to those who may choose not to temporarily register.
If I decide I want to remain on the register and work, what support will I be offered?
When you have completed your online survey confirming your wish to return to practice, you will be contacted to confirm where and when you would like to work. At this point a bespoke package of support will be agreed to enable you to return to work safely. This will include:
DBS and identity checks which will be undertaken remotely and quickly;
A fast track induction including all key mandatory training requirements to ensure you are supported to practise safely;
More specific guidance, for example, on the scope of your practice, management of coronavirus and use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Will I be expected to have an appraisal or undergo a professional re-validation process?
No, this will not be necessary under these circumstances, this is a temporary post so neither are required.
Will I need clearance from the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) – formerly the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB)?
Yes, though if you have a recent DBS Certificate or have maintained a subscription to the DBS Update Service then it may not be necessary for a further application to be submitted. An assessment will be done by your employing organisation, using guidance from NHS Employers, to determine if a further check is required.
Where a new DBS application is required, the DBS are proposing to extend the scope of their services to include a new fast track check against the adults and/children’s barred lists. These arrangements will enable employers to recruit into a regulated activity before receiving the full disclosure certificate, where they have undertaken a risk assessment and put in place appropriate monitoring and supervision.
Please note you will not be required to pay for a DBS check.
Will I get paid and how will this be agreed?
Yes, you will be remunerated for any work you do in a way that reflects the responsibilities you undertake. This will be discussed and negotiated with you at the point of your return into work.
Will I have a contract and how many hours can I work?
Yes, you will be offered a contract that reflects working hour protections, pay arrangements and annual leave entitlement etc. Your working hours and pattern will be agreed between you and the organisation in which you have decided to work.
Where can I work? Can I work without being in a directly patient-facing role?
Where possible, you will be offered work at an organisation where you have worked before or are already linked with. There might be rare occasions where we would ask if you would consider moving to a different area to cover local needs but this will be in accordance with your identified skills and competencies and will be discussed with you beforehand. There are also a range of opportunities for non-patient facing roles such as manning telephone triage lines or working with NHS111.
What if I’m concerned about my health, I’m pregnant, immunosuppressed, have health problems or am a primary carer?
Given the increased risk of COVID-19 in those with co-morbidity and in the elderly population, we would of course advise against returning to patient-facing clinical work if you belong to this group. There are a range of opportunities you may wish to consider in non-patient facing roles that may be more suited and these can be discussed in more detail as part of your bespoke offer. More information I s available here https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults
Once I’ve accepted temporary registration, what happens next?
Your contact details will be passed on to the teams working within your local or preferred areas so that they can begin talking through your options with you.
What sort of work might I be expected to do?
There are a range of different roles that you might want to consider, these include (but aren’t limited to): supporting clinical teams in NHS111 services, working on wards or in care homes, helping with outpatient clinics (this could be via telephone), providing education or training to other clinicians and providing routine clinical cover.
Your role will be very much dependent upon your expertise and skills, what you feel comfortable doing and the need within your local areas.
In these challenging circumstances it is recognised that as clinicians we may be asked to work outside our normal field of practice and the regulators have published a joint statement to explain this, to support you, you can access this here.
I am already in another role (such as education or research) - what are the next steps for me?
If you have a joint contract between clinical and educational/research roles, your organisation will contact you to discuss whether you are in a position to provide more clinical support. Those with teaching expertise may be able to help provide induction for others including those returning health care professionals – for example, in the use of PPE, managing high flow oxygen or ventilated patients (if appropriately trained to do so).
I work in a part time non-registered clinical role, with another non-clinical role. What can I do?
We’d recommend you discuss with your employers under what circumstances you should temporarily suspend your external commitments in order to provide more clinical support in your employing organisation. The balance between supporting point of care services directly and delivering the business as usual work should be carefully considered on a case by case basis.
I’m concerned about my accountability as a returning registrant, where can I seek advice?
We acknowledge that you may be anxious about returning to practice, especially in these unprecedented circumstances. You will be only asked to practice within your scope of competency and in line with the NMC Code. If a concern is raised about a nurse or a midwife while on the temporary register these would not be dealt with by way of any Fitness to Practise proceedings. However, where there were justifiable concerns the NMC Registrar would have the power to remove you from the temporary register.
Will I have insurance and indemnity cover?
Yes – arrangements are already in place to indemnify any professional working in a hospital trust or GP practice. For other places of work you will be able to discuss the options available to you at the point of deployment.
What happens at the end of my contract/temporary registration?
At this point your contract will come to an end and you will be removed from the register. To continue to practice as a registered nurse or midwife you would need to re-join the register permanently. The NMC will be able to help you if you wish to do this.
What if I change my mind and I don’t want to work anymore – who do I tell?
You are free to change your mind at any time. If you change your mind and don’t want to work anymore you should highlight this to your direct line manager and arrange for steps to taken for you to leave work safely and as appropriate. If you wish to opt out of the temporary register at any point please visit the NMC’s website and complete the opt-out form.
What if I become ill when I am working or concerned that I may have coronavirus?
If you become ill while working, local policy and national guidance must be followed to ensure your safety and the safety of others. You should immediately inform your line manager and withdraw from work. If you have concerns regarding COVID-19 please follow national guidance which you can access via NHS111.

pour les foyers potentiellement
infectés par le coronavirus
(COVID-19)
Mis à jour le 16 mars 2020
Les symptômes
Les symptômes les plus courants du coronavirus (COVID-19) sont
l'apparition récente d'une :
• toux continue et/ou
• forte fièvre
Pour la plupart des gens, le coronavirus (COVID-19) sera une maladie bénigne.
Principaux messages
• si vous vivez seul(e) et présentez des symptômes associés au
coronavirus (COVID-19), même s'ils sont légers, ne quittez pas votre
domicile pendant 7 jours à compter de l'apparition des symptômes.
(Consultez la section intitulée mettre fin à son confinement ci-dessous
pour obtenir plus d'informations)
• si vous vivez avec d'autres personnes et que vous ou l'une d'elles
présentez des symptômes associés au coronavirus, tous les membres du
foyer doivent rester à leur domicile et ne pas le quitter pendant 14 jours.
La période de 14 jours commence le jour où le premier occupant du
domicile est tombé malade
• il est probable que des personnes vivant sous le même toit se
transmettront le virus ou seront déjà infectées. Rester à votre domicile
pendant 14 jours réduira significativement le nombre total de concitoyens
que votre foyer pourrait infecter
• tout membre du foyer qui commence à présenter des symptômes doit
rester à domicile pendant 7 jours à partir de l'apparition des symptômes,
quel que soit le stade où il/elle en est de la période de confinement initiale
de 14 jours. (Consultez la section intitulée mettre fin à son confinement ci-
dessous pour obtenir plus d'informations)
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#ending-isolation
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#ending-isolation
• si possible, éloignez les individus vulnérables (comme les personnes
âgées et celles atteintes d'affections préexistantes) de votre domicile, afin
qu'ils séjournent avec des ami(e)s ou d'autres membres de la famille
pendant la période de confinement du foyer
• si vous n'êtes pas en mesure d'éloigner les personnes vulnérables de
votre domicile, tenez-vous autant que possible à distance d'eux
• si vous présentez des symptômes associés au coronavirus :

Personnes concernées par ces directives
Ces conseils sont destinés aux :
• personnes présentant des symptômes qui pourraient être causés par le
coronavirus, pour lesquelles une hospitalisation n'est pas nécessaire et
qui doivent rester confinées jusqu'à leur guérison
• personnes vivant au sein d'un foyer dont un membre présente des
symptômes qui pourraient être causés par le coronavirus
Mesures pour vous aider à vous préparer dès maintenant
Établissez un plan pour votre foyer ou famille
La meilleure mesure à prendre maintenant est d'établir un plan pour déterminer
comment adapter votre routine quotidienne, ainsi que celle des autres membres de
votre foyer, afin d'être en mesure de suivre ces conseils. Afin de vous préparer, vous
pouvez notamment :
https://111.nhs.uk/
https://111.nhs.uk/
• parler à vos voisins et à votre famille, et échanger vos numéros de
téléphone et coordonnées
• tenir compte des membres de votre foyer considérés comme vulnérables
et établir un plan les concernant
• créer une liste de contacts incluant les numéros de téléphone de vos
voisins, des écoles, de votre employeur, de votre pharmacien et NHS 111
• créer des comptes d'achat en ligne si possible
Mon foyer sera-t-il testé si nous pensons présenter des symptômes associés
au coronavirus ?
Il n'est pas nécessaire que vous fassiez des tests de dépistage du coronavirus si
vous restez à domicile.
Raisons pour lesquelles il est très important de rester à votre domicile
Il est très important que les individus présentant des symptômes qui
pourraient être causés par le coronavirus et les membres de leur foyer
restent à leur domicile. Rester chez soi aidera à contrôler la transmission du
virus à des ami(e)s, au reste de la population et, particulièrement, aux plus
vulnérables.
Les personnes présentant des symptômes et vivant seules devraient rester à
leur domicile pendant 7 jours à partir de l'apparition des symptômes
(consultez mettre fin à son confinement ci-dessous). Ceci réduira le risque de
transmission à d'autres personnes.
Si vous vivez avec d'autres personnes et que vous ou l'une d'elles présentez
des symptômes associés au coronavirus, tous les membres du foyer doivent
rester à leur domicile et ne pas le quitter pendant 14 jours (consultez mettre
fin à son confinement ci-dessous). Si possible, évitez de sortir, même pour
acheter de la nourriture ou d'autres produits essentiels, sauf pour faire de
l'exercice et, dans ce cas, tenez-vous à bonne distance des autres. La
période de 14 jours commence le jour où le premier occupant de votre
domicile tombe malade.
Si ce n'est pas possible, limitez au maximum vos contacts sociaux quand
vous quittez votre domicile pour vous approvisionner.
Il est probable que des personnes vivant sous le même toit se transmettront
le virus ou seront peut-être déjà infectées. Rester à votre domicile pendant
14 jours réduira significativement le nombre total de concitoyens que votre
foyer pourrait infecter.

Rester confiné(e) peut être difficile et frustrant, mais vous pouvez prendre
des mesures pour faciliter ce processus, notamment :
• établir un plan préalable et réfléchir à ce dont vous aurez besoin pour être
en mesure de rester confiné(e) pendant toute la durée des 7 ou 14 jours
• demander à votre employeur, à vos ami(e)s et à votre famille de vous
aider à obtenir ce dont vous avez besoin pour pouvoir rester à votre
domicile
• réfléchir à la manière dont vous allez vous procurer de la nourriture et
d'autres produits, comme des médicaments, dont vous aurez besoin
pendant cette période, et établir un plan de mise en œuvre
• demander à des ami(e)s ou à votre famille de vous apporter tout ce dont
vous avez besoin, ou commander des produits en ligne, mais vous
assurer qu'ils sont déposés à l'extérieur de votre domicile où vous les
récupérerez
• vous assurer de rester en contact avec vos ami(e)s et votre famille par
téléphone et par le biais des réseaux sociaux
• réfléchir aux activités que vous pouvez faire pendant votre période de
confinement à domicile. Les personnes qui ont réussi à rester confinées
pendant toute cette période se sont tenues occupées en se livrant à des
activités comme la cuisine, la lecture, l'apprentissage en ligne ou le
visionnage de films
• établir un plan pour la totalité des 14 jours, par exemple sur un calendrier
improvisé, s'est révélé utile pour de nombreuses personnes Prévoir vos
activités à l'avance en cas, par exemple, d'aggravation significative de
l'état d'un membre de votre foyer, comme l'apparition de difficultés
respiratoires, pourrait également vous aider
• une fois que vous irez mieux, n'oubliez pas que l'exercice physique peut
contribuer à améliorer votre bien-être. Rechercher des cours ou
formations en ligne pour vous aider à faire un peu d'exercice à votre
domicile
Pendant votre période de confinement à domicile, assurez-vous de faire les
choses suivantes
Confinement à domicile
Vous et tous les membres de votre foyer devriez rester à domicile. Ne vous
rendez pas au travail, à l'école ou dans des lieux publics, et
n'empruntez pas les transports publics ou les taxis.
Si possible, évitez de sortir, même pour acheter de la nourriture ou d'autres
produits essentiels, sauf pour faire de l'exercice et, dans ce cas, tenez-vous
à bonne distance des autres. La période de 14 jours commence le jour où le
premier occupant de votre domicile tombe malade.
Si vous avez besoin d'aide pour acheter des denrées alimentaires, d'autres
produits ou pour aller chercher des médicaments ou aller promener votre
chien, sollicitez l'aide de vos ami(e)s ou des membres de votre famille. Vous
pouvez également faire vos courses ou commander des médicaments par
téléphone ou en ligne. Dans ce cas, n'oubliez pas de dire aux livreurs de
laisser les articles à l'extérieur où vous les récupérerez. Le livreur ne doit pas
entrer chez vous.
Si vous êtes employé(e) et ne pouvez pas travailler en raison du coronavirus,
veuillez vous référer à ces directives du ministère du Travail et des Retraites
(Department for Work and Pensions) pour prendre connaissance des
mesures de soutien à votre disposition.
Si vous vivez avec des enfants
Veuillez suivre ces conseils du mieux que vous pouvez. Toutefois, nous
sommes conscients qu'il ne sera pas possible d'appliquer toutes ces
mesures.
Nous avons constaté jusqu'à présent que les enfants atteints du coronavirus
semblent être affectés moins gravement. Il est néanmoins important que
vous fassiez de votre mieux pour suivre ces conseils.
Si vous vivez avec une personne vulnérable
Réduisez autant que possible le temps passé par la personne vulnérable
dans les espaces communs, comme les cuisines, les salles de bains et les
espaces de détente, et veillez à ce que les espaces communs soient bien
ventilés.
Efforcez-vous de rester à 2 mètres (3 pas) des personnes vulnérables avec
lesquelles vous vivez et encouragez-les à dormir dans un autre lit dans la
mesure du possible. Si possible, elles devraient utiliser une salle de bains
différente de celle des autres occupants de votre domicile. Assurez-vous
qu'elles n'utilisent pas les mêmes serviettes que les autres occupants de
votre domicile pour se sécher après un bain ou une douche, et après s'être
lavé les mains.
Si vous partagez des toilettes ou une salle de bains avec une personne
vulnérable, il est important de les nettoyer après chaque utilisation (par
exemple, en essuyant les surfaces que vous avez touchées). Une autre
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-employees
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-employees
astuce consiste à établir un planning d'utilisation de la salle de bains, les
personnes vulnérables y ayant accès en premier.
Si vous partagez une cuisine avec une personne vulnérable, évitez de
l'utiliser en sa présence.
Dans la mesure du possible, elles devraient emporter et manger leurs repas
dans leur chambre. Si vous en avez un, utilisez un lave-vaisselle pour laver
et sécher la vaisselle et les couverts sales de la famille. Si ce n'est pas
possible, lavez-les en utilisant votre liquide vaisselle habituel et de l'eau
chaude, puis séchez-les soigneusement. Si la personne vulnérable utilise ses
propres ustensiles, n'oubliez pas d'utiliser un torchon différent pour les
sécher.
Nous comprenons qu'il sera difficile pour certaines personnes de vivre
isolées des autres occupants de leur domicile. Vous devriez faire tout votre
possible pour suivre ces directives et tous les membres de votre foyer
devraient se laver les mains régulièrement, éviter de toucher leur visage et
nettoyer régulièrement les surfaces qu'ils ont touchées.
Si vous allaitez alors que vous êtes infectée
Actuellement, aucune donnée ne suggère que le virus peut être transmis par
le lait maternel. L'infection peut être transmise au bébé de la même manière
qu'à n'importe quelle personne en contact étroit avec vous. Les données
actuelles indiquent que les enfants atteints du coronavirus présentent des
symptômes beaucoup moins graves que les adultes. Les avantages associés
à l'allaitement surpassent les risques potentiels de transmission du virus par
le lait maternel ou un contact rapproché. Toutefois, il s'agira d'une décision
individuelle et vous pouvez en discuter avec votre sage-femme, un visiteur
de santé ou un médecin généraliste par téléphone.
Si vous ou un membre de votre famille nourrissez un bébé avec du lait
maternisé ou exprimé, vous devriez soigneusement stériliser le matériel
avant chaque utilisation. Vous ne devriez pas partager des biberons ou un
tire-lait avec un tiers.
Vous trouverez davantage d’informations sur le site du Collège royal des
obstétriciens et gynécologues (Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists).
Nettoyage et élimination des déchets
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/
Lors de votre nettoyage, vous devriez utiliser vos produits ménagers
habituels, comme des détergents et de l'eau de Javel, car ils seront très
efficaces pour éliminer le virus des surfaces. Nettoyez les surfaces touchées
fréquemment comme les poignées de porte, les rampes, les télécommandes
et les plateaux de tables. Ceci est particulièrement important si une personne
âgée ou vulnérable vit sous votre toit.
Les déchets personnels (comme les mouchoirs usagés) et les lingettes de
nettoyage jetables peuvent être éliminés en toute sécurité dans des sacs
poubelle jetables. Ces sacs devraient être placés dans un autre sac,
solidement fermés et conservés à l'écart des autres déchets. Ils devraient
être gardés à l'écart pendant au moins 72 heures avant d'être mis dans votre
conteneur extérieur habituel.
Les autres déchets ménagers peuvent être éliminés comme d'habitude.
Lessive
Afin de réduire la possibilité de disperser le virus dans l'air, ne secouez pas
votre linge sale.
Lavez les articles de manière appropriée et conformément aux instructions
fournies par le fabricant. Tout le linge sale peut être lavé dans la même
machine.
Si vous ne possédez pas de machine à laver, attendez 72 heures après la fin
de votre période de confinement de 7 jours (confinement individuel) ou de
14 jours (pour les foyers) pour pouvoir laver votre linge dans une laverie
publique.
Les mesures que vous pouvez prendre pour contribuer à votre rétablissement
Buvez de l'eau pour rester hydraté(e). Vous devriez boire assez pendant la
journée pour que votre urine (pipi) soit pâle et non trouble. Vous pouvez
utiliser des médicaments en vente libre, comme le paracétamol, pour vous
aider à combattre certains symptômes. Utilisez-les en respectant les
instructions sur l'emballage ou le dépliant, et n'excédez pas la dose
recommandée.
Si vous ou votre famille avez besoin d'un avis médical
Consultez rapidement un médecin si votre maladie ou celle d'un membre de
votre foyer s'aggrave. S'il ne s'agit pas d'une urgence, contactez NHS 111 en
ligne à l'adresse 111.nhs.uk. Si vous n'avez pas accès à Internet, vous
devriez appeler NHS 111. S'il s'agit d'une urgence et que vous avez besoin
d'appeler une ambulance, composez le 999 et informez le gestionnaire
d'appel ou l'opérateur que vous ou le membre de votre famille présentez des
symptômes associés au coronavirus.
Tous les rendez-vous médicaux et dentaires de routine devraient
normalement être annulés pendant la période où vous et votre famille restez
à domicile. Si vous êtes inquiet/inquiète ou qu'il vous a été demandé de vous
présenter en personne pendant votre période de confinement à domicile,
discutez-en au préalable avec votre contact médical (par exemple, votre
médecin généraliste, votre hôpital local ou votre service ambulatoire) en
utilisant le numéro qui vous a été fourni. Si vos inquiétudes concernent vos
symptômes associés au coronavirus, contactez NHS 111 en ligne. Si vous
n'avez pas accès à Internet, vous devriez appeler NHS 111.
Lavez-vous souvent les mains
Lavez-vous les mains fréquemment chaque jour en utilisant du savon et de
l'eau pendant 20 secondes ou en utilisant un gel hydroalcoolique. Ceci
contribuera à vous protéger, ainsi que les personnes avec lesquelles vous
vivez. Cette mesure est l'un des moyens les plus efficaces pour réduire le
risque de transmettre l'infection à d'autres.
Couvrez votre visage lorsque vous toussez et éternuez
Couvrez votre bouche et votre nez avec des mouchoirs jetables quand vous
toussez ou éternuez. Si vous n'en avez pas à portée de main, éternuez dans
le creux de votre coude, pas dans votre main.
Si vous avez un(e) soignant(e), il/elle devrait utiliser des mouchoirs jetables
pour essuyer tout mucus ou flegme quand vous avez éternué ou toussé.
Il/Elle devrait ensuite se laver les mains avec du savon et de l'eau.
Éliminez les mouchoirs dans un sac poubelle jetable et lavez-vous
immédiatement les mains avec du savon et de l'eau ou en utilisant un gel
hydroalcoolique.
Masques faciaux
Nous ne recommandons pas l'utilisation de masques faciaux comme un
moyen efficace de prévenir la propagation de l'infection. Les masques
faciaux jouent un rôle important dans des contextes cliniques, comme dans
https://111.nhs.uk/
les hôpitaux, mais très peu de preuves confirment que leur utilisation en
dehors de ces contextes présente un avantage.
Ne recevez pas de visites à domicile
N'invitez personne et n'acceptez pas de visites sociales, comme celles
d'autres ami(e)s ou membres de votre famille, à l'intérieur de votre domicile.
Si vous voulez parler à une personne qui ne vit pas avec vous, utilisez le
téléphone ou les réseaux sociaux.
Si vous ou un membre de votre famille recevez des soins essentiels à
domicile, les soignant(e)s devraient continuer les visites. Des masques
faciaux et des gants seront fournis aux soignant(e)s afin de réduire le risque
que vous leur transmettiez l'infection.
Si vous avez des animaux de compagnie à votre domicile
À l'heure actuelle, il n'est pas prouvé que les animaux de compagnie, comme les
chiens et les chats, puissent être infectés par le coronavirus.
Veiller à votre bien-être pendant votre confinement à domicile
Nous savons que rester à domicile pendant une période prolongée peut être
difficile et frustrant, que certaines personnes peuvent souffrir de solitude et
que vous ou d'autres membres de votre foyer pouvez être déprimé(e)(s).
Cela peut être particulièrement éprouvant si vous vivez dans un espace
réduit ou sans accès à un jardin.
Il est important de prendre soin de votre esprit comme de votre corps, et
d'obtenir un soutien si vous en avez besoin. Restez en contact avec votre
famille et vos ami(e)s par téléphone ou sur les réseaux sociaux. Il existe
également des sources de soutien et d'information utiles, comme le site
Internet Every Mind Matters.
Réfléchissez aux activités que vous pouvez faire pendant votre période de
confinement à domicile. Les personnes qui n'ont pas été perturbées par le
fait de rester à leur domicile pendant une semaine se sont tenues occupées
en se livrant à des activités comme la cuisine, la lecture, l'apprentissage en
ligne ou le visionnage de films. Si vous vous sentez assez bien, vous pouvez
faire un peu d'exercice chez vous ou dans votre jardin.
Pour beaucoup de personnes, il est utile de se rappeler la raison pour
laquelle ce qu'elles font est si important. Avec un peu de chance, aucun
membre de votre famille ne souffrira de symptômes plus graves que ceux
d'une grippe. Cependant, certaines personnes sont gravement affectées par
https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/
le coronavirus, particulièrement les personnes âgées et celles souffrant de
certains troubles médicaux. En restant chez vous, vous protégez la vie
d'autres personnes, tout en garantissant que le NHS ne sera pas débordé.
Mettre fin à son confinement ou à celui de son foyer
Si vous avez présenté des symptômes, vous pouvez mettre fin à votre
confinement au bout de 7 jours.
La période de 7 jours commence le jour où vous tombez malade.
Si vous vivez avec d'autres personnes, tous les membres de votre foyer non
affectés par le coronavirus peuvent mettre fin à leur confinement au bout de
14 jours. La période de 14 jours commence le jour où la première personne
tombe malade. La période d'incubation du coronavirus est de quatorze jours ;
les personnes qui ne présentent pas de symptômes au bout de 14 jours ne
sont donc probablement pas contagieuses.
Au bout de 7 jours, si la première personne à être tombée malade se sent
mieux et n'a plus de forte fièvre, elle peut reprendre ses activités habituelles.
Si un autre membre de votre famille tombe malade pendant la période de
confinement de 14 jours, il doit suivre les mêmes conseils, c'est-à-dire que
s'il se sent mieux et n'a plus une forte fièvre 7 jours après l'apparition de ses
symptômes, il peut reprendre ses activités habituelles.
Si un membre du foyer développe des symptômes associés au coronavirus
vers la fin de la période de confinement de 14 jours (par exemple, le 13e ou
14e jour), il n'est pas nécessaire de prolonger la période de confinement,
mais la personne présentant les nouveaux symptômes doit rester à
domicile pendant 7 jours.
La période de confinement de 14 jours aura significativement réduit le
nombre total de personnes que le reste du foyer pourrait infecter et il n'est
pas nécessaire d'entamer une nouvelle période de confinement de 14 jours
pour tous les membres du foyer. Cette démarche aura apporté un niveau
élevé de protection de la population. Un confinement supplémentaire des
membres de ce foyer n'apportera qu'une très faible protection
supplémentaire à la population.
À l'issue de la période de 14 jours, tout membre de la famille qui n'est pas
tombé malade peut mettre fin à son confinement.
Si une personne malade au sein du foyer n'a présenté aucun signe
d'amélioration et n'a pas encore consulté un médecin, elle devrait
contacter NHS 111 en ligne. Si votre domicile ne dispose pas d'un accès à
Internet, vous devriez appeler NHS 111.
La toux peut persister plusieurs semaines chez certaines personnes, alors
même que l'infection causée par le coronavirus a été traitée. Une toux
persistante isolée ne signifie pas qu'une personne doit continuer à s'isoler
pendant plus de 7 jours.

Details
This guidance is intended for:
people with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, and do not require hospital treatment, who must remain at home until they are well
those living in households with someone who shows symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus
The main messages are:
if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. See ending isolation section for more information
if you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill
for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14-day isolation period. See ending isolation section for more information
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community
if you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period
if you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible
if you have coronavirus symptoms:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
you do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home
testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home
plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home and consider what can be done for vulnerable people in the household
ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home
wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water, or use hand sanitiser
if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.
If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111.

Social media and comment moderation policy
Social media and comment moderation policy
Comments received via the NHS England website
Twitter
We encourage and welcome open, lively debate, but the decision to publish comments received via this site and our YouTube channel remains at our discretion. The views expressed by any third parties are solely theirs and are not necessarily endorsed by NHS England.
Comments on all pages may be closed after 4 weeks.
Moderation Policy
We ask you to please bear in mind our guidelines when submitting comments.
Where views have been sought, all comments will be considered before the response is published.
Moderation guidelines
We pre-moderate all of the comments we receive.
‘Pre-moderation’ means that comments will not be published instantly. Comments will be checked first by moderators who will monitor the site during normal working hours (0900 – 1700, GMT, Monday to Friday) and aim to process comments as quickly as possible.
This is not about censoring your views. The aim is to ensure that comments relate to the particular subject being discussed. Moderation will not be used to suppress legitimate, reasoned discussion.
Sometimes there is a delay in publishing whilst we seek information from various sources to be included in our response to questions.
We will normally approve comments for publication as long as they:
are on-topic. Please don’t post messages that are not related
respect other people. Comments should not be malicious or offensive in nature, and should not constitute a personal attack on a person’s character
don’t incite hatred on the basis of race, religion, gender, nationality or sexuality or any other personal characteristic
don’t reveal personal details, such as private addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or other online contact details
are reasonably concise, and don’t constitute spamming of the site
are not persistent or repetitive negative messages which aim to provoke a response and/or don’t constructively add to the conversation
don’t impersonate or falsely claim to represent a person or organisation
are not party political in nature. The NHS is always high on the political agenda, and whilst we acknowledge that references to political parties and their policies may often be inevitable, we reserve the right to exclude comments which are purely party-political in nature or seek to advertise political events.
don’t include swearing, hate-speech or obscenity
don’t break the law – this includes libel, condoning illegal activity, and breaking copyright
don’t advertise commercial products and services – you can mention relevant products and services as long as they support your comment
are in English – unfortunately, we do not currently have the resource to moderate comments in other languages
if you are aged 16 or under, please get you parent/guardian’s permission before submitting a comment. Users without this consent are not allowed to participate or provide us with personal information.
We reserve the right to suspend comments at any time, and remove comments older than six months. Where we choose not to publish a comment for a reason other than those listed above, we will reply to the commenter by email explaining our reason and inviting them to make appropriate changes so that the comment can be reconsidered.
We read every comment, and respond wherever we can. We endeavour to answer your questions where possible, but if you require an official response you should contact NHS England by post or email.
Twitter
NHS England uses Twitter, a free messaging service offered by a third party, as one tool in its efforts to communicate clearly, quickly and in an engaging manner to people interested in our work. You can follow us @NHSEngland
Twitter content delivered by NHS England includes (but is not limited to):
links to news releases, blog posts, videos, guidance and other approved, publicly available NHS England material
links to relevant information produced and published elsewhere (work of other NHS organisations, patient organisations, researchers, news organisations and others). This can include videos, blog posts, and retweets (RTs) from other Twitter users. (See below for our policy on RTs.)
interesting facts, quotes or observations related to our work
topical questions related to our work intended to provoke discussion
Retweets (RTs)
Tweets we repeat (RT) do not imply endorsement on the part of NHS England. We may retweet news, links and personal observations we believe are relevant to the work we do.
Twitter as a source of official policy
Tweets should not be considered as the authoritative source of new policy or guidance from NHS England. Any change or evolution in NHS England’s official position on legislation, guidance, investigations and audits will be communicated through more traditional channels: official publications and statements on our website, speeches, and media releases.
Importantly, our decision to RT should not be taken as explicit endorsement of any position or argument that may vary from NHS England’s current official position, nor should it be taken as an indication of a possible shift in the current official position.
Following
NHS England’s decision to follow a particular Twitter user does not imply endorsement of any kind. We follow accounts on Twitter we believe are relevant to our work. This could include following the Twitter accounts of companies and other commercial enterprises (and/or their employees) who comment on NHS England related issues.
Availability
We commit to updating and monitoring our Twitter account during regular office hours: 0900 – 1700, GMT. However, like many Twitter users, we may monitor and respond at other times of the day. We accept no responsibility for lack of service due to Twitter downtime.
@Replies and Direct Messages
We will read all @replies and Direct Messages sent to us and, when possible, will respond to them. Please note that, due to the volume of traffic on our Twitter account, it is not always possible to respond and we encourage users to use other ways to contact us if their question or comment requires urgent attention.
Complaints, Media Requests and Personal Issues
We encourage you to follow traditional channels to make a media request, freedom of information (FOI) request or complaint. See details of other ways to contact us.
NHS England Staff Tweeting
Some NHS England staff tweet under their own names or pseudonyms. Despite their professional affiliation with NHS England, their tweets do not represent the official position of the Board, and should be considered the product of each individual as a private citizen.

What to do if you have symptoms
Stay at home for 7 days if you have either:
a high temperature
a new continuous cough
if you live with other people, they should stay at home for 14 days from the day the first person got symptoms.
This will help to protect others in your community while you are infectious.
Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.
You do not need to contact NHS 111 to tell them you’re staying at home.
Testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home.
Read the guidance about staying at home.
Number of cases
As of 9am on 21 March 2020, 72,818 people have been tested in the UK, of which 67,800 were confirmed negative and 5,018 were confirmed positive.
As of 9am, 233 patients in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) have died.
Cases identified in England
Confirmed cases in each local authority and NHS region are published by Public Health England (PHE).
Risk level
The risk to the UK has been raised to high.
Recent government action
The government published its coronavirus action plan on 3 March.
On 10 February, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, announced strengthened legal powers to protect public health.
The Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 have been put in place to reduce the risk of further human-to-human transmission in this country by keeping individuals in isolation where public health professionals believe there is a reasonable risk an individual may have the virus.

Details
This guidance is intended for:
people with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, and do not require hospital treatment, who must remain at home until they are well
those living in households with someone who shows symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus
The main messages are:
if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. See ending isolation section for more information
if you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill
for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14-day isolation period. See ending isolation section for more information
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community
if you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period
if you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible
if you have coronavirus symptoms:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
you do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home
testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home
plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home and consider what can be done for vulnerable people in the household
ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home
wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water, or use hand sanitiser
if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.
If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111.

Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.
You do not need to contact NHS 111 to tell them you’re staying at home.
Testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home.

On 10 February, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, announced strengthened legal powers to protect public health.
The Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 have been put in place to reduce the risk of further human-to-human transmission in this country by keeping individuals in isolation where public health professionals believe there is a reasonable risk an individual may have the virus.

gospodarstw domowych z
podejrzeniem zakażenia
koronawirusem (COVID-19)
Aktualizacja 16 marca 2020 r.
Objawy
Najczęstszymi objawami świadczącymi o zakażeniu koronawirusem (COVID-
19) są:
• utrzymujący się kaszel i/lub
• wysoka temperatura
U większości osób zakażenie koronawirusem (COVID-19) przebiega łagodnie.
Najważniejsze wytyczne
• osoby mieszkające samotnie, u których wystąpią nawet łagodne objawy
zakażenia koronawirusem (COVID-19), powinny pozostać w domu przez
7 dni od ich wystąpienia. (Więcej informacji na ten temat przedstawiono w
części dotyczącej zakończenia izolacji
• jeśli objawy koronawirusa wystąpią u któregokolwiek domownika w
domach zamieszkanych przez kilka osób, wszyscy członkowie
gospodarstwa domowego muszą pozostać w domu i nie opuszczać go
przez 14 dni. Okres 14 dni rozpoczyna się od dnia zachorowania
pierwszej osoby.
• prawdopodobnie osoby mieszkające w tym samym gospodarstwie
domowym będą zarażać się nawzajem lub już zostały zarażone.
Pozostanie w domu przez 14 dni w znacznym stopniu zredukuje ogólną
liczbę osób, które mogłyby zostać zakażone w społeczności lokalnej.
• każdy członek gospodarstwa domowego, który zacznie wykazywać
objawy musi pozostać w domu przez 7 dni od ich wystąpienia, niezależnie
od tego, który to będzie dzień z 14 ustalonych dni kwarantanny. (Więcej
informacji na ten temat przedstawiono w części dotyczącej zakończenia
izolacji
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#ending-isolation
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#ending-isolation
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#ending-isolation
• o ile to możliwe, należy przenieść osoby wymagające szczególnej opieki
(takie jak osoby w podeszłym wieku oraz te z istniejącymi problemami
zdrowotnymi) do znajomych lub rodziny na czas kwarantanny domowej.
• jeśli osoby wymagające szczególnej opieki muszą pozostać w domu,
należy przebywać jak najdalej od nich.
• w razie wystąpienia objawów koronawirusa:
• nie należy udawać się do przychodni zdrowia, apteki ani szpitala
• nie ma konieczności kontaktowania się z numerem 111 w celu
przekazania informacji o pozostaniu w domu
• badanie na obecność koronawirusa nie jest konieczne w razie
pozostawania w domu
• należy planować z wyprzedzeniem i zwracać się o pomoc do innych, aby
z powodzeniem pozostać w domu oraz zastanowić się, co można zrobić
dla osób wymagających szczególnej opieki w gospodarstwie domowym
• należy zwrócić się o pomoc do swojego pracodawcy, znajomych i rodziny,
aby uzyskać produkty niezbędne do pozostania w domu
• należy myć regularnie ręce przez 20 sekund, za każdym razem wodą z
mydłem lub używać środka odkażającego
• jeśli z objawami nie można poradzić sobie w domu, stan zdrowia ulega
pogorszeniu lub objawy nie ustępują po 7 dniach, należy skorzystać z
usługi NHS 111 online ds. koronawirusa. W razie braku dostępu do
Internetu należy dzwonić do NHS 111. W stanach nagłego zagrożenia
zdrowia należy zadzwonić pod numer 999.
Dla kogo przeznaczone są niniejsze wytyczne
Niniejsze wytyczne przeznaczone są dla:
• osób z objawami wywołanymi przez koronawirusa i niewymagajacymi
leczenia szpitalnego, które muszą pozostać w domu, dopóki nie poczują
się lepiej
• mieszkających w gospodarstwie domowym z osobami wykazującymi
objawy koronawirusa
Co może obecnie pomóc w przygotowaniach
Przygotowanie planu dla swojego gospodarstwa domowego lub rodziny
Najlepszym rozwiązaniem jest obecnie takie przygotowanie planu adaptacji swoich
codziennych czynności oraz czynności pozostałych członków gospodarstwa
domowego, aby można było zastosować się do wytycznych. Niektóre ze sposobów
umożliwiających przygotowania obejmują:
• rozmowy z sąsiadami i rodziną, aby wymienić się numerami telefonów
• rozważenie i ustalenie planu dla domowników uznanych za osoby
wymagające szczególnej pomocy
https://111.nhs.uk/
• opracowanie listy kontaktów z numerami telefonów sąsiadów, szkół,
pracodawcy, farmaceuty, NHS 111.
• w miarę możliwości założenie kont w sklepach świadczących usługę
zakupów przez Internet
Czy domownicy zostaną poddani testom po wystąpieniu u nich objawów
przypominających koronawirusa?
Badanie na obecność koronawirusa nie jest konieczne w razie pozostawania w
domu.
Dlaczego pozostawanie w domu jest tak ważne
Pozostawanie w domu przez osoby z objawami, które mogą być wywołane
wirusem jest bardzo ważne. Pozostawanie w domu pomoże w kontroli
rozprzestrzeniania się wirusa na znajomych, szerszą społeczność, a
szczególnie na osoby najbardziej narażone na zagrożenia.
Osoby mieszkające samotnie powinny pozostać w domu przez 7 dni po
wystąpieniu objawów (patrz część dotyczącą zakończenia samoizolacji
poniżej). Obniży to ryzyko zakażenia innych osób.
Jeżeli objawy koronawirusa wystąpią u któregokolwiek z domowników w
domach zamieszkanych przez kilka osób, wszyscy członkowie gospodarstwa
domowego muszą pozostać w domu i nie opuszczać go przez 14 dni (patrz
część dotyczącą zakończenia samoizolacjiponiżej). O ile to możliwe, nie
należy wychodzić z domu w celu innym niż aktywność fizyczna, nawet po
zakup żywności oraz innych niezbędnych rzeczy. W takim przypadku należy
zachować bezpieczną odległość od innych osób. 14-dniowy okres
rozpoczyna się od dnia zachorowania pierwszej osoby w gospodarstwie
domowym.
Jeśli to niemożliwe, należy dołożyć wszelkich starań, aby ograniczyć kontakty
towarzyskie po wyjściu z domu po zaopatrzenie.
Prawdopodobnie osoby mieszkające w tym samym gospodarstwie domowym
będą zarażać się nawzajem lub już zostały zarażone. Pozostanie w domu
przez 14 dni w znacznym stopniu zredukuje ogólną liczbę osób, które
mogłyby zostać zakażone w spłeczności lokalnej.
Pozostawanie w domu może być trudne i irytujące, ale można podjąć
działania, które to ułatwią. Należy do nich:
• planowanie z wyprzedzeniem i przemyślenie, co umożliwi pozostanie w
domu przez 7 lub 14 dni
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#ending-isolation
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#ending-isolation
• należy zwrócić się o pomoc do swojego pracodawcy, znajomych i rodziny,
aby uzyskać dostęp do produktów niezbędnych do pozostania w domu
• należy przemyśleć i zaplanować dostęp do żywności oraz innych
produktów, takich jak leki, które mogą być potrzebne podczas
pozostawania w domu
• należy zwrócić się z prośbą do znajomych i rodziny o dostarczenie
wszystkiego, co niezbędne lub złożenie zamówienia w Internecie,
upewniając się, że zostanie pozostawione przed domem
• należy pozostawać w kontakcie ze znajomymi i rodziną, wykorzystując
telefon lub media społecznościowe
• należy zastanowić się, co można robić podczas pozostawania w domu
Osoby, które przetrwały w domu okres kwarantanny starały się zajmować
gotowaniem, czytaniem, nauką w Internecie oraz oglądaniem filmów.
• dla wielu osób pomocne okazuje się dokładne zaplanowanie 14 dni, np.
za pomocą samodzielnie wykonanego kalendarza. Pomocne może
okazać się również wcześniejsze planowanie czynności, które należy
podjąć, jeśli któryś z domowników poczuje się znacznie gorzej,
doświadczając trudności z oddychaniem
• powracając do zdrowia, należy pamiętać o ćwiczeniach fizycznych, które
mogą poprawić samopoczucie W internecie można wyszukać lekcje i
kursy, które pomogą w wykonywaniu lekkich ćwiczeń w domu
Podczas pozostawania w domu należy wykonywać wskazane niżej czynności
Pozostać w domu
Wraz z pozostałymi członkami gospodarstwa domowego należy pozostać w
domu. Nie należy chodzić do pracy, szkoły oraz miejsc publicznych,
nie należy korzystać z transportu publicznego ani taksówek.
O ile to możliwe, nie należy wychodzić z domu w celu innym niż aktywność
fizyczna, nawet po zakup żywności oraz innych niezbędnych rzeczy. W takim
przypadku należy zachować bezpieczną odległość od innych osób. 14-
dniowy okres rozpoczyna się od dnia zachorowania pierwszej osoby.
Jeśli potrzebna jest pomoc przy zakupie artykułów spożywczych, innych
artykułów, odbioru leków lub wyprowadzania psa na spacer, należy zwrócić
się o pomoc do znajomych lub krewnych. Alternatywnie, leki można zamówić
przez telefon lub przez Internet. Zakupy również można zamówić przez
Internet. Należy poinformować dostawców, aby pozostawili zakupy na
zewnątrz do obioru, jeśli zostały zamówione przez Internet. Dostawca nie
powinien wchodzić do domu.
Osoby zatrudnione, które nie mogą chodzić do pracy z powodu
koronawirusa, powinny zapoznać się z wytycznymi Ministerstwa Pracy i
Emerytur (z ang. Department for Work and Pensions), aby dowiedzieć się,
jakie wsparcie mogą uzyskać.
Osoby mieszkające z dziećmi
Należy w miarę swoich możliwości zastosować się do niniejszych
wytycznych, chociaż nie wszystkie działania będą możliwe do wykonania.
Z tego, co wiadomo do chwili obecnej wynika, że dzieci wydają się łagodniej
przechodzić zakażenie koronawirusem. Tym niemniej ważne jest jak
najdokładniejsze zastosowanie się do niniejszych wytycznych.
Mieszkając z osobami wymagającymi szczególnej opieki
Należy jak najbardziej ograniczyć czas przebywania członków rodziny
wymagających szczególnej opieki we wspólnych miejscach, takich jak
kuchnie, łazienki i pokoje dzienne, które powinny być właściwe wietrzone.
Nie należy zbliżać się do osób wymagających szczególnej opieki na
odległość bliższą niż 2 metry (3 kroki) i zachęcać je do spania w osobnych
łóżkach, o ile to możliwe. W miarę możliwości powinny one korzystać z innej
łazienki niż reszta domowników. Należy dopilnować, aby korzystały z
oddzielnych ręczników, zarówno do wycierania się po wzięciu kąpieli lub
prysznica, jak i do zachowania właściwej higieny rąk.
W razie korzystania z tej samej łazienki i toalety co osoba wymagająca
szczególnej opieki ważne jest, aby posprzątać je po użyciu (na przykład
wycierając powierzchnie, z którymi miało się kontakt). Kolejną wskazówką
jest ustalenie grafika korzystania z kąpieli. Osoba wymagająca szczególnej
opieki powinna brać kąpiel w pierwszej kolejności.
W razie korzystania z tej samej kuchni co osoba wymagająca szczególnej
opieki należy unikać korzystania z niej w tym samym czasie.
O ile to możliwe, posiłki powinne być przenoszone i spożywane w pokojach.
Należy korzystać ze zmywarki do mycia i suszenia sztućców i naczyń, o ile
jest dostępna. W razie braku suszarki należy je myć, wykorzystując zwykły
płyn do mycia naczyń oraz ciepłą wodę, po czym osuszyć je dokładnie. Jeśli
osoba wymagająca szczególnej opieki korzysta z własnych przyborów
kuchennych, należy używać osobnych ścierek do ich wycierania.
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-employees
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-employees
To zrozumiałe, że niektórym osobom będzie trudno odizolować się od
pozostałych domowników. Należy dokonać wszelkich starań, aby
postępować zgodnie z niniejszymi wytycznymi. Każdy członek gospodarstwa
domowego powinien regularnie myć ręce, unikać dotykania twarzy oraz
czyścić często dotykane powierzchnie.
Karmienie piersią w razie zakażenia
Nie istnieją obecnie dowody sugerujące, że wirus może być przenoszony z
mlekiem matki. Infekcja może zostać przeniesiona na dziecko w taki sam
sposób, jak na każdą inną osobę pozostającą w bliskim kontakcie z osobą
zakażoną. Według obecnych dowodów dzieci z koronawirusem mają
znacznie łagodniejsze objawy niż osoby dorosłe. Korzyści wynikające z
karmienia piersią przewyższają ryzyko przeniesienia wirusa z mlekiem matki
oraz pozostawania w bliskim kontakcie. Jest to jednak indywidualna decyzja,
którą można omówić telefonicznie z położną, pielęgniarką środowiskową lub
lekarzem pierwszego kontaktu.
W razie karmienia mieszanką dla niemowląt lub odciąganym mlekiem matki
należy dokładnie sterylizować sprzęt przed jego użyciem. Nie należy
wymieniać się z nikim butelkami ani odciągaczem pokarmu.
Więcej informacji można znaleźć na na stronie internetowej Royal College of
Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.
Sprzątanie oraz utylizacja śmieci
Do sprzątania należy stosować artykuły gospodarstwa domowego
powszechnego użytku, takie jak detergenty i wybielacze, ponieważ będą
bardzo skuteczne przy usuwaniu wirusów z powierzchni. Należy czyścić
często dotykane powierzchnie, takie jak klamki w drzwiach, poręcze, piloty
oraz blaty stołów. Jest to szczególnie ważne, gdy w domu znajdują się osoby
starsze lub osoby wymagające szczególnej opieki.
Odpady osobiste (takie jak zużyte chusteczki) oraz jednorazowe ściereczki
do czyszczenia powinny być przechowywane bezpiecznie w jednorazowych
workach na śmieci. Worki te powinny być umieszczane w innych workach,
zawiązywane bezpiecznie i przechowywane oddzienie od innych śmieci.
Powinny zostać odstawione na bok na co najmniej 72 godziny przed
umieszczeniem w zwykłym zewnętrznym pojemniku na śmieci.
Inne odpady domowe mągą być utylizowane jak zwykle.
Pranie
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/
Aby zminimalizować możliwość rozprzestrzeniania się wirusa w powietrzu,
nie należy strzepywać brudnych rzeczy do prania.
Należy prać stosownie do okoliczności, zgodnie z zaleceniem producenta.
Wszystkie brudne rzeczy można prać razem.
Jeśli nie ma pralki, należy odczekać dalsze 72 godziny po upływie 7-
dniowego (w przypadku samoizolacji) lub 14-dniowego okresu kwarantanny
(dla gospodarstw domowych) przed zaniesiem prania do pralni
samoobsługowej.
Co można zrobić, aby pomóc sobie w powrocie do zdrowia
Należy pić wodę, aby właściwie się nawadniać. Należy wypijać tyle płynów w
ciągu dnia, aby oddawany mocz był jasnego koloru. Można zażywać leki
sprzedawane bez recepty, takie jak paracetamol, aby złagodzić niektóre
objawy. Leki należy zażywać zgodnie z zaleceniami na opakowaniu lub
etykiecie i nie przekraczać zalecanej dawki.
Zasięganie porady lekarskiej dla samego siebie lub członka rodziny
W razie pogorszenia się stanu zdrowia któregokolwiek z domowników należy
bezzwłocznie zasięgnąć pomocy lekarskiej. Jeśli nie jest to nagły wypadek,
należy skontaktować się z elektronicznie z NHS 111 na stronie internetowej
111.nhs.uk. W razie braku dostępu do Internetu należy skontaktować się
telefonicznie z NHS 111. W nagłych wypadkach należy wezwać karetkę
pogotowia, dzwoniąc pod numer 999 i poinformować operatora o objawach
koronawirusa u siebie lub osoby spokrewnionej.
Wszystkie rutynowe wizyty u lekarza i stomatologa powinny zostać
odwołane, a członkowie rodziny powinni pozostać w domu. W razie
wątpliwości lub konieczności osobistego stawienia się na wizycie w okresie
kwarantanny domowej należy najpierw skontaktować się z wyznaczonym
indywidualnie punktem kontaktu w służbie zdrowia (na przykład lekarzem
pierwszego kontaktu, miejscowym szpitalem lub ambulatorium) pod podanym
numerem telefonu. Jeśli obawy dotyczą doświadczanych objawów
koronawirusa, należy skontaktować się z NHS 111 online. W razie braku
dostępu do Internetu należy skontaktować się telefonicznie z NHS 111.
Należy często myć ręce
Należy utrzymywać ręce w czystości, myjąc je codziennie wodą z mydłem
przez 20 sekund lub używająć środka do dezynfekcji. Pomaga to chronić
https://111.nhs.uk/
samego siebie oraz mieszkające wspólnie osoby. Jest to jedno z
najskuteczniejszych działań obniżających ryzyko przeniesienia infekcji na
inne osoby.
Należy zasłaniać usta i nos podczas kaszlu i kichania
Podczas kaszlu i kichania należy zasłaniać usta i nos jednorazowymi
chusteczkami. Jeśli nie ma ich pod ręką, należy kichać w zgięcie łokcia, nie w
rękę.
Opiekunowie powinni używać chusteczek jednorazowych do wycierania śluzu
lub flegmy po kichaniu lub kaszlu swoich podopiecznych. Następnie powinni
umyć ręce wodą z mydłem.
Chusteczki należy wyrzucać do jednorazowych worków na śmieci i
natychmiast myć ręce wodą z mydłem lub używać środka do dezynfekcji rąk.
Maski ochronne
Nie zalecamy stosowania masek ochronnych jako skutecznego środka
zapobiegającego rozprzestrzenianiu się infekcji. Maski odgrywają ważną rolę
w środowisku klinicznym, takim jak szpitale. Istnieje jednak niewiele
dowodów na korzyści płynące z ich stosowania poza tym środowiskiem.
Nie należy przyjmować gości
Nie należy zapraszać ani wpuszczać do domu gości, np. znajomych lub
innych członków rodziny. Aby porozmawiać z kimś, kto nie jest członkiem
gospodarstwa domowego, należy korzystać z telefonu lub mediów
społecznościowych.
Jeżeli któremukolwiek z członków rodziny zapewniana jest opieka domowa
przez dochodzących opiekunów, nie powinni oni zaprzestawać swoich wizyt.
Opiekunom zostaną zapewnione maski ochronne i rękawiczki, aby obniżyć
ryzyko zakażenia.
Posiadanie zwierząt domowych
W chwili obecniej nie ma dowodów na to, że zwierzęta towarzyszące/domowe, takie
jak psy i koty, mogą zarazić się koronawirusem.
Dbanie o własne samopoczucie podczas pozostawania w domu
Wiadomo, że pozostawanie w domu przez długi okres czasu może być
trudne i irytujące dla niektórych osób. Mogą one czuć się samotne lub
przygnębione, tak jak inni członkowie gospodarstwa domowego. Może
stanowić to szczególne wyzwanie dla osób, które nie mają zbyt dużo miejsca
ani dostępu do ogrodu.
O swój stan psychiczny należy zadbać w takim samym stopniu, jak o ciało, a
w razie potrzeby poprosić o pomoc. Należy utrzymywać kontakt z rodziną i
znajomymi za pomocą telefonu lub mediów społecznościowych. Isnieją
również źródła wsparcia oraz pomocnych informacji, takie jak strona
internetowa Every Mind Matters.
Należy zastanowić się, co można robić podczas pozostawania w domu.
Osoby, które nie mają nic przeciwko pozostawaniu w domu przez tydzień,
starają się być zajęte gotowaniem, czytaniem, nauką w Internecie oraz
oglądaniem filmów. Można wykonywać lekkie ćwiczenia fizyczne w domu lub
w ogrodzie, jeśli pozwala na to stan zdrowia.
Dla wielu osób pomocne okazuje się przypominanie sobie dlaczego to, co
robią, jest takie ważne. Miejmy nadzieję, że u nikogo w waszych rodzinach
nie wystąpią objawy inne niż grypopodobne. Niektóre osoby bywają jednak
poważnie dotknięte koronawirusem, szczególnie osoby starsze, zwłaszcza te
z istniejącymi wcześniej schorzeniami. Pozostając w domu chroni się życie
innych osób i zapobiega przeciążeniu publicznej służby zdrowia.
Zakończenie samoizolacji oraz izolacji wszystkich domowników
Osoby, u których wystąpiły objawy, mogą zakończyć samoizolację po 7
dniach.
Okres 7-dniowej samoizolacji rozpoczyna się pierwszego dnia choroby.
W razie mieszkania z innymi osobami, wszyscy członkowie gospodarstwa
domowego, którzy nie zachorowali, mogą zakończyć kwarantannę domową
po 14 dniach. 14-dniowy okres rozpoczyna się od dnia, kiedy zachorowała
pierwsza osoba. Okres inkubacji wirusa trwa czternaście dni. Osoby, które
będą wciąż zdrowe po 14 dniach najprawdopodobniej nie zostały zakażone.
Jeśli po 7 dniach osoba, która zachorowała pierwsza poczuje się lepiej i nie
będzie mieć wysokiej temperatury, będzie mogła powrócić do codziennych
czynności. Jeśli w ciągu 14-dniowej kwarantanny domowej zachorują inni
członkowie rodziny, powinni postępować według tych samych wytycznych -
tzn. jeśli poczują się lepiej i nie będą mieć wysokiej temperatury po 7 dniach
od wystąpienia objawów, będą mogli powrócić do codziennych czynności.
https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/
https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/
Jeśli u członka gospodarstwa domowego objawy wystąpią pod koniec 14-
dniowego okresu kwarantanny domowej (np. 13 lub 14 dnia) okres izolacji
nie musi być przedłużany, ale osoba z objawami musi pozostać w domu
przez 7 dni.
14-dniowy okres kwarantanny domowej znacznie zredukuje ogólną liczbę
zakażeń, które mogłyby być przenoszone przez domowników. Nie ma
potrzeby wznawiania 14-dniowego okresu kwarantanny dla wszystkich
członków gospodarstwa domowego. Kwarantanna zapewni wysoki poziom
ochrony społeczności lokalnej. Dalsze izolowanie członków danego
gospodarstwa domowego stanowiłoby jedynie nieznaczną dodatkową
ochronę.
Po zakończeniu 14-dniowego okresu kwarantanny każdy domownik, który nie
zachorował może wychodzić z domu.
Jeśli stan zdrowia chorego domownika nie ulega poprawie, a nie zasięgał on
jeszcze porady lekarskiej, należy skontaktować się z NHS 111 online. Jeśli w
domu nie ma dostępu do Internetu, należy zadzwonić pod numer NHS 111.
U niektórych osób kaszel może utrzymywać się przez kilka tygodni, nawet po
wyleczeniu się z wirusa. Kaszel utrzymujący się bez innych objawów nie
oznacza, że należy pozostawać w izolacji przez okres dłuższy niż 7 dni.

Your hospital discharge: going home
This leaflet explains why you are being discharged from
hospital and what you might expect after your discharge.
Why am I being discharged from hospital?
You are being discharged from hospital as your health team have agreed that you are now able to return home.
Why can’t I stay in hospital?
What can I expect?
It is our priority to ensure that you are discharged safely from hospital and to the most appropriate available place.
Your health team will discuss discharge and transport arrangements with you
(and a family member, friend or carer if you wish). If you require care and support when you get home, this will be arranged.
Any care provided will be free of charge for a period of time to support your recovery. After this time you may be required to contribute to the cost of your care.
Who can I contact?
After you have been discharged, if you have any concerns or need to speak to someone about your care, you can contact <Insert locally agreed details e.g. team name and contact number>
The health system is busy helping patients affected by coronavirus
(COVID-19). This is a new illness that can affect the lungs and airways and some people who contract the illness will need to be admitted to hospital. It is important that our hospitals are ready to look after those people who need this hospital care.
Because of this, you will not have a choice over your discharge. You will not be able to remain in hospital if you choose not to accept the care that is being offered to you.
To find out more about coronavirus (COVID-19) and find out how to avoid catching or spreading it, visit www.nhs.uk/coronavirus
Your hospital discharge:
another place of care
What can I expect?
Your discharge and transport arrangements will be discussed with you (and a family member or carer if you wish) and you will be discharged with the care and support you need to a bed in the community. The care provided will be free of charge for a period of time to support your recovery. After this time you may be required to contribute to the cost of your care.
It is possible that you may be moved more than once after your discharge. This is because we will be trying to find the best place for your long term care. Your health team are here to answer any questions you might have.

You are being discharged as your health team have agreed that you are now able to continue your recovery in another care setting, outside of hospital.

Coronavirus?
It is important that our hospitals are ready to look after
people who contract coronavirus (COVID-19) and need
hospital care. Due to these pressures, once you no longer
need care in hospital, as decided by the health team
looking after you, you will be discharged. You will not have
a choice over your discharge, but it is always our priority
to discharge people to a safe and appropriate place.
In most cases this will be
to your home. You might
need some extra support,
for example with your
care needs or shopping.
If you require more
complex out of hospital
care, this could be in
another bed in the
community, for example
a residential nursing
home.
Your needs and
discharge arrangements
will be discussed with
you.
COVID-19 is a new illness
that can affect the lungs and
airways. It is caused by a virus
called coronavirus.
You can find out more about
coronavirus and the best ways to
stop it spreading by visiting
www.nhs.uk/coronavirus
There is currently no specific
treatment and some people who
contract the illness will need to
be admitted to hospital.

if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. See ending isolation section for more information
if you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill
for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14-day isolation period. See ending isolation section for more information
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community
if you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period
if you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible
if you have coronavirus symptoms:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
you do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home
testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home
plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home and consider what can be done for vulnerable people in the household
ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home
wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water, or use hand sanitiser
if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service.
If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111.

Privacy of your information
NHS England (or the NHS Commissioning Board, which is our legal name) uses personal and confidential information for a number of purposes. Our Privacy Notice provides a summary of how we use your information.
Website privacy
Information on this page explains our website privacy policy and how we will use and protect any information about you that you give us when you visit this website.
This privacy statement only covers the NHS England website (www.england.nhs.uk). It does not cover all sites that can be linked to from this site, so you should always be aware when you are moving to another site and read the privacy statement on that site.

By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable NHS England and its service providers to provide you with the services you select. Any information you provide to NHS England will only be used by us, our agents and service providers and will not be disclosed unless we are obliged or permitted to by law to do so.
If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on www.england.nhs.uk or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on www.england.nhs.uk, we may use whatever information is available to us, about you, to stop such behaviour. We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use the service you have requested, and remove it in the event that the purpose has been met or when you no longer wish to continue your subscription.
The Data Protection Act
Under the Data Protection Act, we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from you. We use leading technologies and encryption software to safeguard your data and keep strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it.

Measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there’s enough capacity to ensure they are fast.

庭成员均必须呆在家里且不得离家 14 天。这一 14 天的期限从家里第一
个人生病的那一天开始
 居住在一个家庭中的人可能会相互感染或已经被感染。在家呆 14 天将大
大减少家庭可能传染给社区其他人的总感染量
 对于开始出现症状的家庭中的任何人，他们都需要从出现症状开始在家里
呆 7 天，而无论他们当时处于最初 14 天隔离期的哪一天。（有关更多信
息，请参见下面的结束隔离章节）
 如果可以的话，请将任何弱势群体人员（例如老人和具有基础健康状况的
人）转出您的家，在家庭隔离期间与朋友或家人呆在一起
 如果您不能将弱势群体人员转出家，请尽可能远离他们
 如果您有冠状病毒症状：
 不要前往全科医生诊所、药房或医院
 您无需联系 111 告诉他们您呆在家里
 如果您呆在家里，则无需进行冠状病毒检测
 提前计划并寻求其他人的帮助，以确保您可以成功呆在家里，并考虑可以

本指南适用于谁
该建议适用于：
 有可能因冠状病毒引起的症状并且不需要医院治疗的人，他们必须呆在家
里直到恢复健康
 居住在家庭中显示可能因冠状病毒引起的症状的人
现在可以帮助您准备的事项
为与您同住的人或家人制定计划
您现在可以做的最好的事情是计划如何适应您的日常活动以及家庭中其他人的日常活
动，以便能够遵守该建议。您可以进行准备的一些方法包括：
 与您的邻居和家人交谈，并交换家庭联系电话号码
 考虑并为您的家庭中被认为是弱势群体的人员制定计划
 制定一份包含邻居、学校、单位、药店、NHS 111 电话号码的联系人名单
 尽可能设置在线购物账户
如果我们认为自己患有冠状病毒症状，是否将对我的家人进行检测？
如果您呆在家里，则无需进行冠状病毒检测。
为什么呆在家里很重要
患有可能因冠状病毒引起的症状的人及其家庭成员呆在家里非常重要。呆在家
里将有助于控制该病毒向朋友、更广泛的社区尤其是最弱势群体的传播。
有症状并独自居住的人应在症状发作后保持呆在家里 7 天（请参阅下面的结
束自我隔离）。这将减少您感染其他人的风险。
如果您与他人一起居住，并且您或其中有人患有因冠状病毒引起的症状，则所
有家庭成员均必须呆在家里且不得离家 14 天（参阅下面的结束自我隔离）。
如果可能的话，除了锻炼以外，您甚至不应该外出购买食物或其他必需品，但
如果是那样，请与他人保持安全距离。这一 14 天的期限从家里第一个人生病
的那一天开始

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#ending-isolation
如果不可能的话，那么当您离开家中获得补给品时，您应该尽量限制您的社交
联系。
居住在一个家庭中的人可能会相互感染或已经被感染。在家呆 14 天将大大减
少家庭可能传染给社区其他人的总感染量。
呆在家里可能会很困难且令人沮丧，但是您可以做一些事情来帮助使它变得轻
松些。这包括：
 提前计划，考虑一下您需要什么才能在家里呆上整整 7 天或 14 天
 与您的雇主、朋友和家人交谈，寻求他们的帮助，以获取您能够呆在家里
所需的东西
 考虑并计划在此期间您将如何获得食物和其它用品（例如药品）
 请朋友或家人放下您需要的物品或在线订购补给品，但请确保这些物品被
放在您的家外，以供您收集
 确保您通过电话或社交媒体与朋友和家人保持联系
 考虑一下您呆在家里期间可以做的事情。成功在家里呆过一段时间的人曾
经用做饭、读书、在线学习和看电影等活动打发时间
 许多人发现为整整 14 天进行计划（例如在临时日历上）会有所帮助。您
还可能会发现提前计划好您的工作会有帮助，例如，如果家中某人感到更
糟，例如呼吸困难
 当您感觉好些时，请记住体育锻炼对您的健康有益。寻找可以帮助您在家
中进行低强度锻炼的在线班级或课程
当您呆在家里时，请确保做以下事情
留在家里
您和所有家庭成员应呆在家里。不要去上班、上学或公共场所，不要使用公共
交通工具或出租车。
如果可能的话，除了锻炼以外，您甚至不应该外出购买食物或其他必需品，但
如果是那样，请与他人保持安全距离。这一 14 天的期限从家里第一个人生病
的那一天开始
如果您需要帮助购买日用品、其它物品或购买药品或遛狗，则需要请朋友或亲
戚帮忙。或者，您可以通过电话或在线订购药品。您也可以在线进行购物。如
果您在线订购，请确保告知送货司机将物品留在门外，以供收集。送货司机不
应进入您的家中。
如果您是一名员工且因冠状病毒无法上班，请参阅本工作和养老金部的指南，
以了解有关您可以使用的支持的信息。
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-employees
如果您与孩子们一起居住
尽您所能继续遵守此建议，但是，我们知道并非所有这些措施都是可行的。
到目前为止，我们看到的是冠状病毒患儿受到的影响似乎较轻。不过，请务必
尽您所能遵守本指南。
如果您有弱势群体人员与您同住
尽可能减少任何弱势家庭成员在共用空间（如厨房、浴室和起居区）中度过的
时间，并确保共用空间通风良好。
力求与弱势群体人员保持 2 米（3 步）的距离，并鼓励他们分床睡。如果可
以，他们应该使用与其他家庭成员分开的浴室。确保他们使用与家庭中其他成
员分开的毛巾，各自用于在洗澡或淋浴后擦干身体和用于手部卫生的目的。
如果您确实与弱势群体人员共用卫生间和浴室，则重要的一点是在每次使用时
都要进行清洁（例如擦拭您接触过的表面）。另一项提示是考虑起草一个洗澡
轮次表，让弱势群体人员首先使用该设施。
如果您与弱势群体人员共用厨房，请避免在他们在场时使用。
如果可以的话，他们应该把饭菜带回他们的房间去吃。如果有的话，请用洗碗
机清洗和干燥家人用过的陶器和餐具。如果无法做到这一点，请用通常的洗涤
液和温水洗涤并彻底干燥。如果弱势群体人员正在使用自己的餐具，请记住使
用单独的抹布把他们的餐具擦干。
我们知道，有些人很难在家里与其他人分开。您应尽您所能遵守此指南，并且
家庭中的每一位成员都应勤洗手，避免触摸脸部并清洁经常触摸的表面。
如果您是在感染时母乳喂养
目前尚无证据表明该病毒可通过母乳传播。感染可以通过与传播给与您密切接
触的任何人相同的方式传播给婴儿。目前的证据表明，冠状病毒患儿的症状比
成年人轻得多。母乳喂养的好处超过通过母乳或密切接触传播病毒的任何潜在
风险；但是，这是一种个人决定，可以通过电话与您的助产士、健康访问员客
或全科医生讨论。
如果您或家人正在喂配方奶或速溶牛奶，则应在每次使用前仔细对设备进行消
毒。请勿与他人共用奶瓶或吸奶器。
您可以在皇家妇产科医师学院的网站上查阅更多信息。
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/
废物的清理和处置
清理时，应使用普通的家用产品，例如洗涤剂和漂白剂，因为它们对于清除表
面的病毒非常有效。清洁经常触摸的表面，例如门把手、扶手、遥控器和台
面。如果您的家里有年长或弱势群体人员，这一点尤其重要。
可以将个人垃圾（例如用过的纸巾）和一次性清洁布安全地存放在一次性垃圾
袋中。这些袋子应放在另一个袋子中，系紧并与其它垃圾分开存放。这应在放
置到通常的家庭外面垃圾箱中之前放置至少 72 小时。
其它家庭垃圾可以照常处置。
洗衣
为了最大程度地减少通过空气传播病毒的可能性，请勿摇动脏衣服。
请按照制造商的说明正确地洗涤衣物。所有脏衣服都可以以相同的洗衣量进行
洗涤。
如果您没有洗衣机，请在 7 天（对于个人隔离）或 14 天（对于家庭）隔离
期结束后再等待 72 个小时，然后才能将衣物送至公共自助洗衣店。
您可以做些什么来帮助自己更快地恢复健康
喝水以保持身体水分；您白天应该多喝水，这样尿液（尿）的颜色会变淡。您
可以使用非处方药（例如扑热息痛）来缓解某些症状。请根据包装或标签上的
说明使用，并且不要超过建议剂量。
如果您或您的家人需要就医
如果您的疾病或任何家庭成员的疾病在恶化，请立即就医。如果不是急诊，请
通过 111.nhs.uk 联系 NHS 111 在线。如果无法上网，则应致电 NHS 111。
如果是急诊并且需要叫救护车，请拨打 999，并告知接线员或话务员您或您的
亲戚有冠状病毒症状。
在您和家人呆在家里时，通常应该取消所有常规的医疗和牙科预约。如果您担
心或被要求在家庭隔离期间亲自出面，请首先与您的医疗联系人（例如您的全
科医生、当地医院或门诊服务）使用他们提供的电话号码进行讨论。如果您的
担心与冠状病毒症状有关，请联系 NHS 111 在线。如果无法上网，则应致电
NHS 111。
勤洗手
https://111.nhs.uk/
每天通过使用肥皂和水清洗 20 秒钟或使用洗手液勤洗手。这将有助于保护您
和与您一起居住的人。该步骤是降低将感染传染给他人风险的最有效方法之
一。
咳嗽和打喷嚏时请遮挡
咳嗽或打喷嚏时，用一次性纸巾遮住口鼻。如果您没有随手可用的纸巾，请将
喷嚏打到肘部弯曲处，而不要打入您的手中。
如果您有照护者，则在您打喷嚏或咳嗽后，他们应使用一次性纸巾擦掉任何粘
液或痰液。然后，他们应该用肥皂和水洗手。
将纸巾放入一次性垃圾袋中，然后立即用肥皂和水清洗手或使用洗手液。
口罩
我们不建议将口罩用作防止感染扩散的有效手段。口罩在诸如医院等临床环境
中起着重要作用，但是很少有证据表明在这些环境之外使用它们会带来益处。
不要接待访客
请勿邀请或允许社交访客（例如其他朋友和家人）进入您的家中。如果您想与
家庭成员以外的人交谈，请使用电话或社交媒体。
如果您或家庭成员在家中接受基本护理，则照护者应继续到访。照护者将被提
供口罩和手套，以减少您传染感染的风险。
如果家里有宠物
目前，没有证据表明伴侣动物/宠物（如狗和猫）可以被冠状病毒感染。
居家照顾您的健康
我们知道，对于某些人来说，长时间呆在家里会很困难、沮丧和孤独，您或其
他家庭成员可能会感到情绪低落。如果您没有够大的空间或无法去花园，这可
能会特别具有挑战性。
重要的是要记住照顾好自己的心情和身体，并在需要时获得支持。通过电话或
社交媒体与家人和朋友保持联系。另外也有可以提供帮助的支持资源和信息，
例如每个人的心理健康都重要网站。
考虑一下您呆在家里期间可以做的事情。不介意在家里呆过一周的人曾经用做
饭、读书、在线学习和看电影等活动打发时间。如果感觉良好，您可以在家中
或花园里进行低强度锻炼。
https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/
许多人发现提醒自己为什么他们正在做的事情如此重要很有帮助。希望您的家
人不会遭受类似流感的症状。但是有些人会受到冠状病毒的严重影响，特别是
老年人和有某些医疗状况的人。通过呆在家里，您可以保护他人的生命，并确
保 NHS 不被累垮。
结束自我隔离和家庭隔离
如果您有症状，则可以在 7 天后结束自我隔离。
这一 7 天的期限从您最初生病的那一天开始
如果与他人住在一起，则所有健康的家庭成员都可以在 14 天后结束家庭隔
离。这一 14 天的期限从第一个人生病的那一天开始。冠状病毒的潜伏期为十
四天； 14 天后保持健康的人不太可能具有传染性。
7 天后，如果第一个生病的人感觉好些并且不再发烧，则可以恢复正常的生
活。如果在 14 天的家庭隔离期间任何其他家庭成员感到不适，则应遵守相同
的建议 - 即在症状出现 7 天后，如果感觉好转且不再发烧，他们也可以返回
他们正常的日常活动。
如果家庭成员在 14 天家庭隔离期的后期（例如在第 13 天或第 14 天）出现
冠状病毒症状，则无需延长家庭隔离期，但是有新症状的人必须呆在家里 7
天。
14 天的家庭隔离期将大大减少其余家庭成员可能继续传播的感染总量，并且
无需为整个家庭重新开始 14 天的隔离期。这将提供高水平的社区保护。进一
步隔离该家庭的成员将几乎没有提供额外的社区保护。
在 14 天的期限结束时，任何没有感到身体不适的家庭成员都可以解除家庭隔
离。
如果家庭中的任何患者没有任何改善的迹象并且尚未就医，则应联系 NHS 111
在线。如果您的家里无法上网，则应致电 NHS 111。
尽管已消除冠状病毒感染，但某些人的咳嗽可能会持续数周。仅持续咳嗽并不
意味着某人必须继续自我隔离 7 天以上。

201,2020-03-22,https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/faq-ffp3-20-march-2020.pdf,,application/pdf,"20 March 2020: FAQs on using FFP 3 Respiratory Protective
Equipment (RPE)
Why are the FFP3 respirators
(masks) provided different to the
usual ones we use?
Due to the sudden increase in demand to use FFP3
masks due to COVID-19, supply chain is using supplies
put aside for pandemic flu. They offer the same level of
protection but are a different design and model.
Why do the FFP3 masks have a
different expiry date?
Some products may appear to have out-of-date ‘use
by/expiration’ dates or have relabelled ‘use by/expiration’
dates. Please be assured products we are issuing have
passed stringent tests that demonstrate they are safe.
The PPE is exposed to extreme conditions for prolonged
periods to see how the product deteriorates. Any that are
not up to standard are destroyed and are not distributed
to trusts.
Why do I need to be ‘Fit tested’
again?
The performance of tight-fitting facepieces depends on
achieving a good contact between the wearer’s skin
and the face seal of the facepiece. Each model of FFP3
mask is slightly different in its fit to each individual face.
The only way to ensure that it will protect you is to repeat
the Fit test again with each model of mask provided.
This
process to fit check is required every time used
If I was ‘Fit tested’ to the make and
model in 2009, do I need to do it
again?
Provided your face shape has not changed since
2009 (weight changes, dental/facial surgery, facial
moles/growths in seal area). It is possible that it may not
be necessary. Do a Fit-check retest if in doubt!
What can I do if we are unable to
meet demand for Fit Testing?
There is an expectation that teams will need to prioritise
Fit-testing for staff groups working in high risk areas. In
recognition of this challenge PHE have engaged the
services of RPA (an independent Respiratory Protective
Equipment (RPE) fit testing company), to offer free
immediate support to trusts (England only) who are being
asked to use FFP3 respirators that may not be their
Business as Usual (BAU) respirator of choice. Booking on
to these courses is via RPA’s helpline on 07947 968972
and 07947 968922. This service will provide a helpline re
training challenges and on-line training on how to run Fit
Test Training.
A local risk assessment will need to be completed.
Follow the most recent Infection Prevention Guidance
We work in an area that is seeing
many symptomatic patients and want
to wear an FFP3 mask but do not
have access to them?
FFP3 masks are only required when managing a
patient/client with possible/confirmed COVID-19 who
is undergoing an Aerosol generating Procedure
(AGP) and when there are COVID-19 patients in High
risk unit (ICU/ITU/HDU). The masks are only protective if
you have been trained and tested in the correct method of
application. If you are looking after this group of patients
and there is a possibility that they have COVID-19 please
escalate the need for urgent training through your
emergency planning and response leads.
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/872745/Infection_prevention_and_control_guidance_for_pandemic_coronavirus.pdf
When should I use FFP3 masks? FFP3 masks are only required when undertaking Aerosol
Generating Procedures (AGP).
This is because the AGP
process generates aerosols (≤5µm) which can result in
exposure to aerosol viral particles. They should also be
worn when you are caring for COVID-19 patients in a
High-risk unit (ICU/ITU/HDU) because lots of aerosols will
be generated.
Definition of AGPs can be found in section 6 of Infection
Prevention Guidance
How long can FFP3 masks be worn
for?
FFP3 masks are tested to ensure they remain effective.
Provided the seal remains intact, they can be worn
comfortably for at least an hour but are effective for
longer unless compromised, eg splashed with body fluids,
damp with respiration. Please refer to the manufacturers’
guidance for maximum duration. This means the masks, if
in full working order and fitted properly, can be worn
constantly for that period of time, while changing other
PPE between patients and cleaning hands. If the mask is
removed please dispose of as orange bag, (category B)
waste, clean hands and change other PPE before
reapplying new masks.
Do I need to wear a FFP3 when
caring for a ventilated patient?
Yes, because although it’s a closed circuit there is a risk
of accidental disconnection of equipment. The circuit is
also opened when patients are undergoing respiratory
physio, being weaned or transported.
If caring for patients in a cohort do I
need to change FFP3 masks
between each patient like gloves and
aprons?
If you are working in Intensive care/High dependency
where several symptomatic patients are cohorted, the
FFP3 masks can be used continually, provided the seal
remains intact for at least an hour, please refer to
manufacturers’ guidance for maximum duration. Please
ensure staff are adequately hydrated prior to applying the
mask.
We are running short of FFP3 masks
how are we to manage our patients
safely?
Masks must only be used as directed and for staff
providing direct care. Masks can be worn for prolonged
periods (as above) and unlike gloves and apron, do not
need to be changed between patients. If a member of
staff does not need to go into the risk area, they should
be kept out.
Why has the guidance changed to
say we can use a fluid repellent
surgical mask (FRSM) when caring
for patients?
COVID-19 is transmitted through respiratory droplets, the
evidence shows that in most cases when delivering direct
care, a FRSM mask will provide adequate protection.
Changing the current PPE guidance means that we will
be able to ensure that the right equipment is used by the
right person at the right time based on the transmission
risk. Table 1 in the Section 6 of the Infection Prevention
Guidance provides guidance of what PPE is required for
each situation.

The The Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 have been put in place with immediate effect to impose restrictions on any individual considered by health professionals to be at risk of spreading the virus.
The regulations apply to any individuals seeking to leave supported isolation before the current quarantine period of 14 days is complete. It will also apply to future cases during the current coronavirus incident where an individual who may be infected or contaminated could present a risk to public health.
Today’s announcement is not a result of a change in risk to the UK public, which remains moderate.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said:
I will do everything in my power to keep people in this country safe. We are taking every possible step to control the outbreak of coronavirus.
NHS staff and others will now be supported with additional legal powers to keep people safe across the country. The transmission of coronavirus would constitute a serious threat - so I am taking action to protect the public and isolate those at risk of spreading the virus.
Clinical advice has not changed about the risk to the public, which remains moderate. We are taking a belt and braces approach to all necessary precautions to ensure public safety.
Our infection control procedures are world leading – what I am announcing today further strengthens our response.
The regulations have been put in place to reduce the risk of further human-to-human transmission in this country.
The strengthened powers, effective immediately, will ensure that NHS staff dealing with possible cases can be confident the necessary powers are in place to keep individuals in isolation where public health professionals believe there is a reasonable risk an individual may have the virus. This is in line with measures taken in other countries.
Over the weekend, the latest government-chartered flight brought a further 100 individuals from the centre of the outbreak in Hubei province to stay in supported isolation in the UK.
The individuals have been taken to the Kents Hill Park conference centre in Milton Keynes where they will remain for 14 days until the end of the incubation period. This follows the same approach for those currently being housed in Arrowe Park NHS accommodation in Wirral.
All passengers were asked to sign a consent form agreeing to stay in supported isolation for at least 14 days until the incubation period is over. In all cases so far, supported isolation has been effective in controlling the spread of the virus.
These powers will give the public further confidence that the repatriation of British citizens back to the UK from Hubei does not increase the risk of further cases in this country.
The UK Chief Medical Officers currently assess the risk to the UK to be moderate.

To: All NHS Medical Directors
All NHS Nursing Directors
Dear colleagues,
CARING FOR PEOPLE AT HIGHEST RISK DURING COVID-19 INCIDENT
We are writing to ask for your help with the management and shielding of patients
who are at the highest risk of severe morbidity and mortality from coronavirus
(COVID-19).
On Monday 16th March the UK government announced a package of measures,
advising those who are or may be at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19
to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures.
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-
and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-
protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults
This wider group, who broadly speaking comprise the criteria of adults eligible for an
annual flu vaccine, will not all be proactively contacted but have been asked to take
steps to reduce their social interactions in order to reduce the transmission of
coronavirus.
There is a subset of this group who have clinical conditions which are likely to put
people at the highest risk of mortality and severe morbidity from COVID-19. We have
identified this group, based on expert consensus.
The method for this is described in
annex 1.
The group includes:
1. Solid organ transplant recipients
2. People with specific cancers
• People with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radical
radiotherapy for lung cancer
• People with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia,
lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment
• People having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for
cancer
• People having other targeted cancer treatments which can affect the
immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors.
• People who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last 6
months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs.
3. People with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic fibrosis, severe
asthma and severe COPD
21 March 2020
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults
2
4. People with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that significantly
increase the risk of infections (such as SCID, homozygous sickle cell)
5. People on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly increase
risk of infection
6. People who are pregnant with significant congenital heart disease
People identified as being in these groups will be sent a letter with advice on how to
protect themselves and access the care and treatment they need during the
COVID19 incident. This involves strict social isolation with no contact from the
outside world beyond that absolutely necessary, for a period of at least 12 weeks; a
move which will significantly impact quality of life, increase social isolation, and
would not be without its own attendant physical and mental health risks.
We identified a core group of patients who are being contacted centrally.
In addition
to this, a number of medical subspecialties in secondary care will receive guidance
asking them to identify and contact additional patients in their caseload who fall
under Group 1 category 5 (see annex 1).
We ask that you take specific care in
reviewing the needs of any cancer patients who meet the above criteria.
This is
because some of these patients will not yet show up in central data records, and
therefore will not have been sent the letter.
We ask that you identify those
patients and immediately send them the attached letter, as soon as you can
this week.
The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges will also be cascading general guidance for
hospital specialties to help them identify and contact further high risk patients from
their caseload. Finally RCGP will be issuing guidance to GPs to help them identify
and contact high risk patients from their own caseload (for example those with
severe multimorbidity).
We ask that you work with your clinical teams to review all ongoing care for all
patients who you believe fall into one of these groups, taking account of the actions
we have set out below. To help with this, trusts shortly will be contacted with a list of
patients who have been centrally identified as being in one of the group 1 categories
and who have an active episode of care with your organisation.
When discussing treatment and care with any patients considered to be high risk,
please ensure they are aware that they should be shielding in line with PHE
guidance available at https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus.
Please also note that
although protective shielding is strongly encouraged for these patients it is also
voluntary, and that patients on end of life care pathways should be excluded.
Where you identify other patients who you consider to be at the very highest risk,
please write to them and, in each case, inform their GP that you have done, so their
records can be updated.
For all patients in the groups above, please work with your clinical teams to:
1. Ongoing care arrangements
https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus
3
Immediately review any ongoing care arrangements that you have with patients that
fall into these groups.
Wherever possible, patient contact, triage and treatment should be provided by
phone, email or online to support these patients to stay at home.
If adjustments can
be made to support this, we ask that you contact patients directly to confirm any new
arrangements.
Some highest risk patients will need to continue attending the hospital or clinic to
receive ongoing care.
Patients have been advised that, unless they hear from you,
they should assume their care will continue as planned.
We are currently developing guidance for Patient Transport Services to ensure that,
where this group of higher risk patients do not have direct access to private
transport, they can still attend hospital and clinic appointments without the need for
public transport.
2. Support with medicine supplies:
Patients have been informed that repeat prescription durations will not change during
this incident, and that patients will need to ensure that their medication can be
collected or delivered to them directly.
Patients who currently have their medication delivered, by a nominated person or by
a pharmacy, should continue to do so.
Patients who need regular medicine but have not yet set up online ordering and
delivery will need to be supported to do so.
We ask that you arrange that suitable
patients be put on electronic repeat dispensing as soon as possible.
Patients have been asked to arrange their own delivery or collection of their
prescriptions through a nominated person, online delivery or delivery from a
community pharmacy.
If they struggle to do this, we have recommended they
contact their GP practice for support.
3. Support with daily living
We have encouraged patients to discuss their daily needs while they have to stay at
home with their carers, friends, families and local community groups.
This includes
support for physical needs such as food and shopping deliveries, as well as their
mental health needs. If they do not have anyone who can help they, they can visit
www.gov.uk/coronavirus-extremely-vulnerable.
4. Urgent medical attention
All patients who display symptoms of COVID-19, have been asked to contact the
NHS 111 online coronavirus service (https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/), or call NHS 111 if
they do not have access to the internet.
However, if patients have an urgent medical question relating to their pre-existing
condition, we have asked that they contact their GP, or their specialist consultant,
directly.

https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/

5. Looking after your own health
It is important that you look after your and your staff’s own health and wellbeing at
this time.
If, at any point, you think you or a member of your team have developed symptoms
of COVID-19, such as a new, continuous cough and/or high temperature (above
37.8), seek clinical advice using the NHS 111 online coronavirus service
(https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/) or, if you do not have access to the internet, call NHS
111.

Annex 1 – Identification of Vulnerable Groups: Methods from CMO
This annex explains the basis of the latest advice that has been sent to all patients
who are considered to be at highest risk of mortality and severe morbidity from
coronavirus (COVID-19). Emerging clinical data about COVID-19 indicated that the
death rate would be high for groups of people with particular chronic diseases. The
modelling suggests that if we were able to effectively shield these people it would
have a significant positive effect on the fatality rate in that group and overall (but a
modest effect on the overall curve). This group has therefore been recommended to
undertake shielding measures for their own protection.
In order to be effective these people would have to undergo strict social isolation with
no contact from the outside world beyond that absolutely necessary, for a period of
at least 12 weeks. A move which will significantly impact quality of life, increase
social isolation, and would not be without its own attendant physical and mental
health risks. We therefore drew up a list of conditions which we felt would justify
affected individuals taking such extreme measures. This group are a subset of a
wider more generally vulnerable group (broadly any adult eligible for an annual flu
vaccine), who have already been advised to follow social distancing measures to
reduce their number of contacts for a period of at least 12 weeks.
We developed a four pronged approach towards ensuring coverage across affected
groups by 1) identifying a core group of patients to be contacted centrally by NHS
England; 2) providing guidance to medical subspecialties in
secondary care and
asking them to identify and contact additional patients in their caseload who fall
under Group 1 category 5; 3) working with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges
to cascade general guidance for hospital specialties to help them identify and contact
further high risk patients from their caseload; 4) working with RCGP to issue
guidance to GPs to help them identify and contact high risk patients from their own
caseload (for example those with severe multimorbidity).
Group 1
We took the following steps when drawing up the list of patients who can be
identified centrally by extracting relevant groups from national datasets:
a) NHS England Clinical Reference Groups (groups of experts who advise the
NHS on Direct Commissioning) were asked to consider which conditions
would put patients at intermediate, high or very high risk of severe morbidity
or mortality from COVID-19
b) Based on our current understanding and specialist and wider advice senior
clinicians (NHSE, NHS Digital, PHE, CMO, DCMOs) categorised these
conditions into the following high risk groups (see below)
1. Solid organ transplant recipients
2. People with specific cancers
• People with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radical
radiotherapy for lung cancer
6
• People with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia,
lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment
• People having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments
for cancer
• People having other targeted cancer treatments which can affect the
immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors.
• People who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last
6 months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs.
3. People with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic
fibrosis, severe asthma and severe COPD
4. People with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that
significantly increase the risk of infections (such as SCID,
homozygous sickle cell disease)
5. People on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly
increase risk of infection
6. People who are pregnant with significant heart disease, congenital or
acquired
Group 2
There are some patients on this list who will be contacted by other routes due to
limitations in national datasets. For example, Cancer Units will contact all patients in
category 2; secondary care will contact most of the patients in category 5 via a
cascade from the Royal College of Physicians and associated medical societies
Group 3
In addition, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges will ask its members to identify
any other subgroups of patients they feel are at high risk, and will cascade templates
to hospital specialists. We will ask clinicians who have identified these patients to let
them know directly using a standard letter containing the information they need to
commence shielding and access support. We will ask hospital specialists to inform
the GP of the decision to include patients in the vulnerable group.
Group 4
In addition, we will issue GPs with specific guidance around identification of high risk
patients with complex / severe multimorbidity and ask the GP to contact these
groups directly to recommend they are considered for inclusion in the shielding
group.
We accept that given this is a new and rapidly moving disease there are inevitable
limitations in our methodology but have designed the most robust approach that was
possible at pace with the aim of identifying the maximum number of vulnerable
individuals in sufficient time to effectively shield this group.",84fcf7aa-bdfa-40e2-9a9a-3951c55c47ce.pdf

Symptoms
The most common symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) are recent onset of:
new continuous cough and/or
high temperature
For most people, coronavirus (COVID-19) will be a mild illness.
Main messages
if you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. (The ending isolation section below has more information)
if you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill. See the explanatory diagram
for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14 day isolation period. The ending isolation section below has more information, and see the explanatory diagram
it is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community
if you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period
if you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible
if you have coronavirus symptoms:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
you do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home
testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home
plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home and consider what can be done for vulnerable people in the household
ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home
wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water, or use hand sanitiser
if you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service. If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111. For a medical emergency dial 999
Who this guidance is for
This advice is intended for:
people with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, and do not require hospital treatment, who must remain at home until they are well
those living in households with someone who shows symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus
Things to help you prepare now
Make a plan for your household or family
The best thing you can do now is plan for how you can adapt your daily routine, and that of others in your household, to be able to follow this advice. Some of the ways in which you could prepare include:
talk to your neighbours and family and exchange phone numbers of household contacts
consider and plan for those in your home who are considered vulnerable
create a contact list with phone numbers of neighbours, schools, employer, chemist, NHS 111
set up online shopping accounts if possible
Will my household be tested if we think we have coronavirus symptoms?
Testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home.
Why staying at home is very important
It is very important that individuals with symptoms that may be due to coronavirus and their household members stay at home. Staying at home will help control the spread of the virus to friends, the wider community, and particularly the most vulnerable.
Those with symptoms and living alone should remain at home for 7 days after the onset of their symptoms (see ending self-isolation below). This will reduce the risk of you infecting others.
If you live with others and you or one of them have symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, then household members must stay at home and not leave your house for 14 days (more information in the ending self-isolation section below). If possible, you should not go out even to buy food or other essentials, other than exercise, and in that case at a safe distance from others. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in your house became ill.
If not possible, then you should do what you can to limit your social contact when you leave the house to get supplies.
It is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or may already be infected. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community.
Staying at home may be difficult and frustrating, but there are things that you can do to help make it easier. These include:
plan ahead and think about what you will need in order to be able to stay at home for the full 7 or 14 days
talk to your employer, friends and family to ask for their help to access the things you will need to make your stay at home a success
think about and plan how you can get access to food and other supplies such as medications that you will need during this period
ask friends or family to drop off anything you need or order supplies online, but make sure these are left outside your home for you to collect
make sure that you keep in touch with friends and family over the phone or through social media
think about things you can do during your time at home. People who have successfully completed a period of staying at home have kept themselves busy with activities such as cooking, reading, online learning and watching films
many people find it helpful to plan out the full 14 days, such as on a make-shift calendar. You may also find it helpful to plan in advance what you will do if, for example, someone in the household were to feel much worse, such as have difficulties breathing
when you are feeling better, remember that physical exercise can be good for your wellbeing. Look for online classes or courses that can help you take light exercise in your home
While you are staying at home, make sure you do the following things
Stay at home
You and all household members should remain at home. Do not go to work, school, or public areas, and do not use public transport or taxis.
If possible, you should not go out even to buy food or other essentials, other than exercise, and in that case at a safe distance from others. The 14-day period starts from the day the first person in your house became ill.
If you require help with buying groceries, other shopping or picking up medication, or walking a dog, you will need to ask friends or relatives. Alternatively, you can order medication by phone or online. You can also order your shopping online. Make sure you tell delivery drivers to leave items outside for collection if you order online. The delivery driver should not come into your home.
If you are an employee and unable to work due to coronavirus, please refer to this guidance from the Department for Work and Pensions to find out about the support that is available to you.
If you are living with children
Keep following this advice to the best of your ability, however, we are aware that not all these measures will be possible.
What we have seen so far is that children with coronavirus appear to be less severely affected. It is nevertheless important to do your best to follow this guidance.
If you have a vulnerable person living with you
Minimise as much as possible the time any vulnerable family members spend in shared spaces such as kitchens, bathrooms and sitting areas, and keep shared spaces well ventilated.
Aim to keep 2 metres (3 steps) away from vulnerable people you live with and encourage them to sleep in a different bed where possible. If they can, they should use a separate bathroom from the rest of the household. Make sure they use separate towels from the other people in your house, both for drying themselves after bathing or showering and for hand-hygiene purposes.
If you do share a toilet and bathroom with a vulnerable person, it is important that you clean them every time you use them (for example, wiping surfaces you have come into contact with). Another tip is to consider drawing up a rota for bathing, with the vulnerable person using the facilities first.
If you share a kitchen with a vulnerable person, avoid using it while they are present. If they can, they should take their meals back to their room to eat. If you have one, use a dishwasher to clean and dry the family’s used crockery and cutlery. If this is not possible, wash them using your usual washing up liquid and warm water and dry them thoroughly. If the vulnerable person is using their own utensils, remember to use a separate tea towel for drying these.
We understand that it will be difficult for some people to separate themselves from others at home. You should do your very best to follow this guidance and everyone in your household should regularly wash their hands, avoid touching their face, and clean frequently touched surfaces.
If you are breastfeeding while infected
There is currently no evidence to suggest that the virus can be transmitted through breast milk. Infection can be spread to the baby in the same way as to anyone in close contact with you. The current evidence is that children with coronavirus get much less severe symptoms than adults. The benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breast milk or by being in close contact; however, this will be an individual decision and can be discussed with your midwife, health visitor or GP by telephone.
If you or a family member are feeding with formula or expressed milk, you should sterilise the equipment carefully before each use. You should not share bottles or a breast pump with someone else.
You can find more information at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists website.
Cleaning and disposal of waste
When cleaning you should use your usual household products, like detergents and bleach, as these will be very effective at getting rid of the virus on surfaces. Clean frequently touched surfaces such as door handles, handrails, remote controls and table tops. This is particularly important if you have an older or vulnerable person in the house.
Personal waste (such as used tissues) and disposable cleaning cloths can be stored securely within disposable rubbish bags. These bags should be placed into another bag, tied securely and kept separate from other waste. This should be put aside for at least 72 hours before being put in your usual external household waste bin.
Other household waste can be disposed of as normal.
Laundry
To minimise the possibility of dispersing virus through the air, do not shake dirty laundry.
Wash items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. All dirty laundry can be washed in the same load.
If you do not have a washing machine, wait a further 72 hours after your 7-day (for individual isolation) or 14-day isolation period (for households) has ended when you can then take the laundry to a public launderette.
What you can do to help yourself get better
Drink water to keep yourself hydrated; you should drink enough during the day so your urine (pee) is a pale clear colour. You can use over-the-counter medications, such as paracetamol, to help with some of your symptoms. Use these according to the instructions on the packet or label and do not exceed the recommended dose.
If you or your family need to seek medical advice
Seek prompt medical attention if your illness or the illness in any household members is worsening. If it’s not an emergency, contact NHS 111 online. If you have no internet access, you should call NHS 111. If it is an emergency and you need to call an ambulance, dial 999 and inform the call handler or operator that you or your relative have coronavirus symptoms.
All routine medical and dental appointments should usually be cancelled whilst you and the family are staying at home. If you are concerned or have been asked to attend in person within the period you are home isolating, discuss this with your medical contact first (for example, your GP, local hospital or outpatient service), using the number they have provided. If your concerns are related to your coronavirus symptoms contact NHS 111 online. If you have no internet access, you should call NHS 111.
Wash your hands often
Clean your hands frequently each day by washing with soap and water for 20 seconds or using hand sanitiser.
This will help protect you and the people you live with. This step is one of the most effective ways of reducing the risk of passing infection to others.
Cover your coughs and sneezes
Cover your mouth and nose with disposable tissues when you cough or sneeze. If you do not have one to hand, sneeze into the crook of your elbow, not into your hand.
If you have a carer, they should use disposable tissues to wipe away any mucus or phlegm after you have sneezed or coughed. Then they should wash their hands with soap and water.
Dispose of tissues into a disposable rubbish bag and immediately wash your hands with soap and water or use a hand sanitiser.
Facemasks
We do not recommend the use of facemasks as an effective means of preventing the spread of infection. Facemasks play an important role in clinical settings, such as hospitals, but there’s very little evidence of benefit from their use outside of these settings.
Do not have visitors in your home
Do not invite or allow social visitors, such as other friends and family, to enter your home. If you want to speak to someone who is not a member of your household, use the phone or social media.
If you or a family member receive essential care in your home, then carers should continue to visit. Carers will be provided with facemasks and gloves to reduce the risk of you passing on the infection.
If you have pets in the household
At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs and cats can be infected with coronavirus.
Looking after your wellbeing while staying at home
We know that staying at home for a prolonged period can be difficult, frustrating and lonely for some people and that you or other household members may feel low. It can be particularly challenging if you don’t have much space or access to a garden.
It’s important to remember to take care of your mind as well as your body and to get support if you need it. Stay in touch with family and friends over the phone or on social media. There are also sources of support and information that can help, such as the Every Mind Matters website.
Think about things you can do during your time at home. People who have not minded staying at home for a week have kept themselves busy with activities such as cooking, reading, online learning and watching films. If you feel well enough you can take part in light exercise within your home or garden.
Many people find it helpful to remind themselves why what they are doing is so important. Hopefully, none of your family will suffer more than flu-like symptoms. But some people are badly affected by coronavirus, and particularly the elderly and those with certain medical conditions. By staying home, you are protecting the lives of others, as well as making sure the NHS does not get overwhelmed.
Ending self-isolation and household-isolation
Self-isolation
If you have been symptomatic, then you may end your self-isolation after 7 days. The 7-day period starts from the day when you first became ill
Household isolation
If living with others, then all household members who remain well may end household-isolation after 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day illness began in the first person to become ill. Fourteen days is the incubation period for coronavirus; people who remain well after 14 days are unlikely to be infectious.
After 7 days, if the first person to become ill feels better and no longer has a high temperature, they can return to their normal routine. If any other family members become unwell during the 14-day household-isolation period, they should follow the same advice - that is, after 7 days of their symptoms starting, if they feel better and no longer have a high temperature, they can also return to their normal routine.
Should a household member develop coronavirus symptoms late in the 14-day household-isolation period (for example, on day 13 or day 14) the isolation period does not need to be extended, but the person with the new symptoms has to stay at home for 7 days. The 14-day household-isolation period will have greatly reduced the overall amount of infection the rest of the household could pass on, and it is not necessary to restart 14 days of isolation for the whole household. This will have provided a high level of community protection. Further isolation of members of this household will provide very little additional community protection.
At the end of the 14-day period, any family member who has not become unwell can leave household isolation.
If any ill person in the household has not had any signs of improvement and have not already sought medical advice, they should contact NHS 111 online. If your home has no internet access, you should call NHS 111.
The cough may persist for several weeks in some people, despite the coronavirus infection having cleared. A persistent cough alone does not mean someone must continue to self-isolate for more than 7 days.

sydd o bosibl wedi’u heintio â’r
coronafeirws (COVID-19)
Diweddarwyd 16 Mawrth 2020
Symptomau
Mae symptomau mwyaf cyffredin y coronafeirws (COVID-19) fel a ganlyn:
• peswch parhaus newydd a/neu
• tymheredd uchel
I’r rhan fwyaf o bobl, bydd coronafeirws (COVID-19) yn salwch ysgafn.
Prif negeseuon
• os ydych yn byw ar eich pen eich hun a’ch bod yn dioddef o symptomau’r
salwch coronafeirws (COVID-19), waeth pa mor ysgafn ydynt, arhoswch
adref am 7 diwrnod o’r diwrnod y dechreuodd eich symptomau. (Gweler
yr adran terfynu ynysiad isod am ragor o wybodaeth)
• os ydych yn byw gydag eraill ac rydych chi neu un ohonynt yn dioddef o
symptomau’r coronafeirws, yna rhaid i holl aelodau’r aelwyd aros adref a
pheidio â gadael y tŷ am 14 diwrnod. Mae’r cyfnod 14 diwrnod yn
dechrau y diwrnod yr aeth yr unigolyn cyntaf yn y tŷ yn sâl
• mae’n debygol y bydd pobl sy’n byw yn yr un aelwyd yn heintio ei gilydd
neu fod wedi’u heintio eisoes. Bydd aros adref am 14 diwrnod yn lleihau’r
maint cyffredinol o’r haint y gallai’r aelwyd ei drosglwyddo i eraill yn y
gymuned
• mae angen i unrhyw un yn yr aelwyd sy’n dechrau dangos symptomau
aros adref am 7 diwrnod o’r diwrnod y dechreuodd y symptomau, waeth
pa ddiwrnod maent wedi’i gyrraedd yn y cyfnod ynysu gwreiddiol o 14
diwrnod. (Gweler yr adran terfynu ynysiad isod am ragor o wybodaeth)
• os gallwch chi, symudwch unrhyw unigolion bregus (megis yr henoed a’r
rheiny sydd â chyflyrau iechyd sylfaenol) o’ch cartref, i aros gyda
chyfeillion neu deulu dros y cyfnod ynysu adref
• os na allwch symud pobl fregus o’ch cartref, cadwch draw oddi wrthynt
gymaint â phosibl
• os oes gennych symptomau’r coronafeirws:

• peidiwch â mynd i feddygfa meddyg teulu, fferyllfa neu ysbyty
• nid oes angen i chi gysylltu â 111 i ddweud wrthynt eich bod yn aros
adref
• nid oes angen i chi gael eich profi am goronafeirws os ydych chi’n
aros adref
• cynlluniwch ymlaen llaw a gofynnwch i eraill helpu i sicrhau y gallwch aros
adref yn llwyddiannus ac ystyriwch beth a ellir ei wneud ar gyfer pobl
fregus yn yr aelwyd
• gofynnwch i’ch cyflogwr, cyfeillion a theulu i’ch helpu chi i gael y nwyddau
sydd eu hangen arnoch er mwyn aros adref
• golchwch eich dwylo yn rheolaidd am 20 eiliad, gan ddefnyddio sebon a
dŵr bob tro, neu defnyddiwch gel llaw
• os ydych chi’n teimlo na allwch ymdopi â’ch symptomau adref, neu os yw
eich cyflwr yn gwaethygu, neu os nad yw eich symptomau yn gwella ar ôl
7 diwrnod, defnyddiwch wasanaeth coronafeirws ar-lein 111 y GIG. Os
nad oes gennych fynediad at y rhyngrwyd, ffoniwch 111 y GIG. Mewn
argyfwng meddygol, ffoniwch 999
Ar gyfer pwy mae’r canllaw hwn
Bwriedir y cyngor hwn ar gyfer:
• pobl sydd â symptomau a all fod wedi’u hachosi gan y coronafeirws, ac
nad ydynt angen triniaeth yn yr ysbyty, ond mae’n rhaid iddynt aros adref
nes eu bod yn well
• y rheiny sy’n byw yn yr aelwyd gyda rhywun sy’n dangos symptomau a all
fod wedi’u hachosi gan y coronafeirws
Pethau i’ch helpu chi i baratoi nawr
Gwnewch gynllun i’ch aelwyd neu deulu
Y peth gorau y gallwch chi ei wneud nawr yw cynllunio o ran sut allwch chi addasu
eich trefn ddyddiol, a threfn eraill yn eich cartref, i’ch galluogi chi i ddilyn y cyngor
hwn. Mae rhai o’r ffyrdd y gallech baratoi yn cynnwys:
• siarad â’ch cymdogion a’ch teulu a chyfnewid rhifau ffôn cysylltiadau
rhwng aelwydydd
• ystyriwch y rheiny yn eich cartref sy’n fregus, a chynlluniwch ar eu cyfer
• crëwch restr cysylltiadau yn cynnwys rhifau ffôn cymdogion, ysgolion,
cyflogwr, fferyllydd, 111 y GIG
• cofrestrwch ar gyfer cyfrifon siopa ar-lein os yn bosibl
A gaiff aelodau fy aelwyd eu profi os ydym ni’n credu bod gennym
symptomau’r coronafeirws?
https://111.nhs.uk/
Nid oes angen i chi gael eich profi am goronafeirws os ydych chi’n aros adref.
Pam bod aros adref yn hollbwysig
Mae’n hynod bwysig bod unigolion sydd â symptomau a all fod yn sgil y
coronafeirws, ac aelodau eu haelwyd, yn aros adref. Bydd aros adref yn
helpu i reoli lledaeniad y feirws ymysg cyfeillion, y gymuned ehangach, a’r
rhai mwyaf bregus yn benodol.
Dylai’r rheiny sydd â symptomau ac yn byw ar eu pen eu hunain aros adref
am 7 diwrnod ar ôl i’w symptomau ddechrau (gweler terfynu hunan-ynysu
isod). Bydd hyn yn lleihau’r risg y gallech chi heintio eraill.
Os ydych chi’n byw gydag eraill ac rydych chi neu un ohonyn nhw yn profi
symptomau a all fod wedi’u hachosi gan y coronafeirws, yna rhaid i aelodau’r
aelwyd aros adref a pheidio â gadael y tŷ am 14 diwrnod (gweler terfynu
hunan-ynysu isod). Os yn bosibl, ni ddylech fynd allan i brynu bwyd neu
hanfodion eraill hyd yn oed, heblaw am wneud ymarfer corff a hynny ar
bellter diogel oddi wrth eraill. Mae’r cyfnod 14 diwrnod yn dechrau y diwrnod
yr aeth yr unigolyn cyntaf yn eich tŷ yn sâl.
Os nad yw’n bosibl, yna dylech, hyd eithaf eich gallu, gyfyngu ar eich cyswllt
cymdeithasol pan fyddwch yn gadael y tŷ i gasglu nwyddau.
Mae’n debygol y bydd pobl sy’n byw yn yr un tŷ yn heintio ei gilydd neu fod
wedi’u heintio eisoes. Bydd aros adref am 14 diwrnod yn lleihau’r maint
cyffredinol o’r haint y gallai’r aelwyd ei drosglwyddo i eraill yn y gymuned.
Gall aros adref fod yn anodd a rhwystredig, ond mae pethau y gallwch chi eu
gwneud i wneud pethau’n haws. Er enghraifft:
• cynlluniwch ymlaen llaw a meddyliwch am y pethau y bydd eu hangen
arnoch er mwyn gallu aros adref am y cyfnod llawn o 7 neu 14 diwrnod
• siaradwch â’ch cyflogwr, cyfeillion a theulu i ofyn am eu cymorth i gael
mynediad at y pethau y bydd eu hangen arnoch i sicrhau eich bod yn
llwyddo i aros adref
• meddyliwch am sut gallwch gael mynediad at fwyd a nwyddau eraill,
megis meddyginiaethau, y byddwch eu hangen yn ystod y cyfnod hwn, a
chynlluniwch ar gyfer hynny
• gofynnwch i gyfeillion neu deulu ddod â phopeth sydd ei angen arnoch
atoch chi neu eu harchebu ar-lein, ond sicrhewch eu bod yn cael eu
gadael y tu allan i’ch cartref er mwyn i chi eu casglu
• sicrhewch eich bod yn cadw cysylltiad â chyfeillion a theulu dros y ffôn
neu drwy gyfryngau cymdeithasol

• meddyliwch am bethau y gallwch eu gwneud yn ystod eich cyfnod adref.
Mae pobl sydd wedi llwyddo i gwblhau cyfnod adref wedi cadw eu hunain
yn brysur drwy wneud gweithgareddau megis coginio, darllen, dysgu ar-
lein a gwylio ffilmiau
• mae nifer o bobl yn ei chael hi’n ddefnyddiol cynllunio’r 14 diwrnod, megis
ar galendr dros dro. Efallai y cewch hi’n ddefnyddiol cynllunio ymlaen llaw
y camau gweithredu petai, er enghraifft, rhywun yn yr aelwyd yn teimlo’n
waeth, megis yn cael anawsterau anadlu
• pan fyddwch yn teimlo’n well, cofiwch y gall ymarfer corff wneud daioni
i’ch lles. Edrychwch am ddosbarthiadau neu gyrsiau ar-lein a all eich
helpu chi i wneud ymarfer corff ysgafn yn eich cartref
Pan rydych chi’n aros adref, sicrhewch eich bod yn gwneud y canlynol
Aros adref
Dylech chi, a holl aelodau’r aelwyd, aros adref. Peidiwch â mynd i’r gwaith,
ysgol, neu fannau cyhoeddus, a pheidiwch â defnyddio trafnidiaeth
gyhoeddus neu dacsis.
Os yn bosibl, ni ddylech fynd allan i brynu bwyd neu hanfodion eraill hyd yn
oed, heblaw am wneud ymarfer corff a hynny ar bellter diogel oddi wrth eraill.
Mae’r cyfnod 14 diwrnod yn dechrau y diwrnod yr aeth yr unigolyn cyntaf yn
eich tŷ yn sâl.
Os oes angen cymorth arnoch gyda phrynu bwyd, nwyddau eraill neu gasglu
meddyginiaeth, neu gerdded ci, bydd angen i chi ofyn i gyfeillion neu
berthnasau. Fel arall, gallwch archebu meddyginiaeth dros y ffôn neu ar-lein.
Yn ogystal, gallwch archebu eich siopa ar-lein. Os ydych yn archebu ar-lein,
sicrhewch eich bod yn dweud wrth yrwyr danfoniadau am adael eitemau y tu
allan er mwyn i chi eu casglu. Ni ddylai’r gyrrwr sy’n danfon ddod i mewn i’ch
tŷ.
Os ydych yn weithiwr ac yn methu gweithio oherwydd y coronafeirws,
cyfeiriwch at y canllaw hwn gan yr Adran Waith a Phensiynau i gael gwybod
am y gefnogaeth sydd ar gael i chi.
Os ydych yn byw gyda phlant
Parhewch i ddilyn y cyngor hwn hyd eithaf eich gallu, fodd bynnag, rydym yn
ymwybodol na fydd yr holl fesurau hyn yn bosibl.
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-employees
Hyd yn hyn, ymddengys bod plant sydd â choronafeirws yn cael eu heffeithio
yn llai difrifol. Wedi dweud hynny, mae’n bwysig gwneud eich gorau i ddilyn y
canllaw hwn.
Os oes gennych unigolyn bregus yn byw gyda chi
Cyfyngwch gymaint â phosibl yr amser mae unrhyw aelod bregus o’r teulu’n
ei dreulio mewn mannau a rennir, megis ceginau, ystafelloedd ymolchi a
mannau eistedd, a sicrhewch fod cyflenwad da o awyr iach yn y mannau a
rennir.
Anelwch at gadw 2 fetr (3 cham) i ffwrdd rhag unrhyw bobl fregus rydych
chi’n byw gyda nhw a’u hannog nhw i gysgu mewn gwely gwahanol, lle
bynnag bo’n bosibl. Os yw hynny’n bosibl, dylent ddefnyddio ystafell ymolchi
wahanol i weddill aelodau’r aelwyd. Sicrhewch eu bod yn defnyddio tyweli
gwahanol i bobl eraill yn eich tŷ, ar gyfer sychu eu hunain ar ôl bod yn y
baddon neu’r gawod ac at ddibenion hylendid dwylo.
Os ydych yn rhannu toiled ac ystafell ymolchi gydag unigolyn bregus, mae’n
bwysig eich bod yn eu glanhau bob tro ar ôl eu defnyddio (er enghraifft,
sychu’r arwynebau yr ydych wedi cyffwrdd ynddynt). Awgrym arall yw
ystyried cynllunio trefn benodol ar gyfer mynd i’r baddon, gyda’r unigolyn
bregus yn cael defnyddio’r cyfleusterau yn gyntaf.
Os ydych chi’n rhannu cegin gydag unigolyn bregus, osgowch ei defnyddio
pan fydd yr unigolyn hwnnw yn bresennol.
Os yn bosibl, dylai unigolion bregus fynd â’u prydau bwyd i’w hystafelloedd
i’w bwyta. Os oes gennych beiriant golchi llestri, manteisiwch arno i lanhau a
sychu’r llestri a’r cyllyll a ffyrc a ddefnyddir gan y teulu. Os nad yw hynny’n
bosibl, golchwch nhw gyda’ch hylif golchi llestri arferol a dŵr cynnes a’u
sychu’n dda. Os yw unigolyn bregus yn defnyddio ei offer ei hun, cofiwch
ddefnyddio tywel sychu gwahanol i sychu’r rhain.
Deallwn y bydd yn anodd i rai pobl arwahanu eu hunain rhag eraill yn y
cartref. Dylech wneud eich gorau glas i ddilyn y canllaw hwn a dylai pawb yn
eich aelwyd olchi eu dwylo yn rheolaidd, osgoi cyffwrdd eu hwynebau, a
glanhau yn rheolaidd arwynebau sy’n cael eu cyffwrdd yn aml.
Os ydych yn bwydo o’r fron tra eich bod wedi’ch heintio
Ar hyn o bryd, nid oes tystiolaeth i awgrymu y gellir trosglwyddo’r feirws drwy
laeth y fron. Gall y baban gael ei heintio yn yr un ffordd ag unrhyw un sydd
mewn cyswllt agos â chi. Y dystiolaeth gyfredol yw bod plant sydd â’r
coronafeirws yn profi symptomau llai difrifol o lawer nag oedolion. Mae
manteision bwydo o’r fron yn gorbwyso unrhyw risgiau posibl o drosglwyddo’r
feirws drwy laeth o’r fron neu drwy fod mewn cyswllt agos; fodd bynnag, eich
penderfyniad chi yw hwn a gallwch drafod gyda’ch bydwraig, ymwelydd
iechyd neu feddyg teulu dros y ffôn.
Os ydych chi neu aelod o’ch teulu yn bwydo gyda llaeth fformwla neu laeth
wedi’i dynnu o’r fron, dylech sterileiddio’r offer yn ofalus bob tro cyn eu
defnyddio. Ni ddylech rannu poteli neu bwmp bron gydag unrhyw un.
Mae rhagor o wybodaeth ar wefan y Coleg Brenhinol yr Obstetryddion a
Gynaecolegwyr.
Glanhau a chael gwared ar wastraff
Wrth lanhau, dylech ddefnyddio cynnyrch arferol eich aelwyd, megis
glanedyddion a chanyddion, gan y bydd y rhain yn hynod effeithiol i gael
gwared ar y feirws ar arwynebau. Glanhewch arwynebau sy’n cael eu
cyffwrdd yn aml, megis handlenni drysau, canllawiau, rheolwyr o bell a
byrddau. Mae hyn yn arbennig o bwysig os oes gennych unigolyn hŷn neu
fregus yn y tŷ.
Gellir storio gwastraff personol (megis hancesi papur wedi’u defnyddio) a
llieiniau glanhau tafladwy yn ddiogel mewn bagiau gwastraff tafladwy. Dylid
rhoi’r bagiau hyn mewn bag arall, ei glymu’n ddiogel a’i gadw ar wahân i
wastraff arall. Dylech gadw hwn i un ochr am o leiaf 72 awr cyn ei roi yn eich
bin gwastraff allan arferol.
Gellir cael gwared ar wastraff arall yr aelwyd yn ôl yr arfer.
Golchi Dillad
I leihau’r posibilrwydd o wasgaru’r feirws drwy’r aer, peidiwch ag ysgwyd
dillad budur.
Golchwch eitemau fel sy’n briodol yn unol â chyfarwyddiadau’r gwneuthurwr.
Cewch olchi’r holl ddillad budr yn yr un llwyth.
Os nad oes gennych beiriant golchi dillad, disgwyliwch 72 awr arall ar ôl i’ch
cyfnod ynysu o 7 diwrnod (ar gyfer ynysu unigol) neu 14 diwrnod (ar gyfer
aelwydydd) ddod i ben, yna gallwch fynd â’ch dillad budr i olchdy cyhoeddus.
Beth allwch chi ei wneud i helpu gwella eich hun
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/
https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/
Yfwch ddŵr i hydradu eich hun; dylech yfed digon yn ystod y dydd fel bod
eich wrin yn lliw clir golau. Gallwch ddefnyddio meddyginiaethau dros y
cownter, megis parasetamol, i helpu gyda rhai o’ch symptomau. Defnyddiwch
y rhain yn unol â’r cyfarwyddiadau ar y paced neu’r label a pheidiwch â
chymryd dim mwy na’r dos argymelledig.
Os oes angen i chi neu eich teulu geisio cyngor meddygol
Ceisiwch sylw meddygol yn syth os yw eich salwch neu salwch unrhyw
aelodau’r aelwyd yn gwaethygu. Os nad yw’n achos o argyfwng, cysylltwch â
111 y GIG ar-lein ar 111.nhs.uk. Os nad oes gennych fynediad at y
rhyngrwyd, dylech ffonio 111 y GIG. Os yw’n achos o argyfwng ac mae
angen i chi ffonio am ambiwlans, ffoniwch 999 a rhowch wybod i weithredwr
yr alwad bod gennych chi neu’ch perthynas symptomau’r coronafeirws.
Fel arfer, dylech ganslo bob apwyntiad meddygol a deintyddol arferol tra’r
ydych chi a’ch teulu yn aros adref. Os ydych yn poeni neu os gofynnir i chi
fynychu yn bersonol yn ystod eich cyfnod hunan-ynysu, trafodwch hyn
gyda’ch cyswllt meddygol yn gyntaf (er enghraifft, eich meddyg teulu, ysbyty
lleol neu wasanaeth cleifion allanol), gan ddefnyddio’r rhif a ddarparwyd i chi.
Os yw eich pryderon yn gysylltiedig â’ch symptomau o’r coronafeirws,
cysylltwch â 111 y GIG ar-lein. Os nad oes gennych fynediad at y rhyngrwyd,
dylech ffonio 111 y GIG.
Golchwch eich dwylo yn aml
Golchwch eich dwylo yn aml bob dydd gan ddefnyddio sebon a dŵr am 20
eiliad, neu defnyddiwch gel llaw. Bydd hyn yn helpu i’ch diogelu chi a’r rheiny
sy’n byw gyda chi. Y cam hwn yw un o’r ffyrdd mwyaf effeithiol o leihau’r risg
o drosglwyddo’r haint i eraill.
Gorchuddiwch eich wyneb wrth besychu a thisian
Gorchuddiwch eich ceg a’ch trwyn gyda hancesi papur tafladwy pan fyddwch
yn pesychu neu disian. Os nad oes gennych hances bapur i’ch llaw, rhowch
eich wyneb ym mhlyg eich penelin wrth disian, yn hytrach na thisian i’ch llaw.
Os oes gennych ofalwr, dylai ddefnyddio hancesi papur tafladwy i sychu
unrhyw fwcws neu fflem ar ôl i chi disian neu besychu. Yna, dylai olchi ei
ddwylo â sebon a dŵr.
Gallwch gael gwared ar hancesi papur mewn bag gwastraff tafladwy a golchi
eich dwylo yn syth gyda sebon a dŵr neu ddefnyddio gel llaw.
https://111.nhs.uk/
Masgiau Wyneb
Nid ydym yn argymell defnyddio masgiau wyneb fel dull effeithiol o atal yr
haint rhag lledaenu. Mae masgiau wyneb yn chwarae rôl bwysig mewn
lleoliadau clinigol, megis ysbytai, ond dim ond ychydig o dystiolaeth sy’n
dangos budd eu defnyddio y tu hwnt i’r lleoliadau hyn.
Peidiwch â chael gwesteion i’ch cartref
Peidiwch â gwahodd neu ganiatáu ymwelwyr cymdeithasol i’ch cartref, megis
cyfeillion neu aelodau eraill o’r teulu. Os hoffech siarad â rhywun nad ydyw’n
aelod o’ch aelwyd, defnyddiwch y ffôn neu gyfrwng cymdeithasol.
Os ydych chi neu aelod o’r teulu yn cael gofal hanfodol yn eich cartref, yna
dylai gofalwyr barhau i ymweld. Bydd gofalwyr yn cael masgiau wyneb a
menig i leihau’r risg y gallech chi ledaenu’r haint.
Os oes gennych anifeiliaid anwes yn yr aelwyd
Ar hyn o bryd, nid oes tystiolaeth bod anifeiliaid cydymaith/anifeiliaid anwes, megis
cŵn a chathod, yn gallu cael eu heintio â’r coronafeirws.
Gwarchod eich lles wrth aros adref
Gwyddom fod aros adref am gyfnod estynedig yn gallu bod yn anodd,
rhwystredig ac unig i rai pobl ac y gallwch chi neu aelodau eraill eich aelwyd
deimlo’n isel. Gall fod yn arbennig o heriol os nad oes gennych lawer o le neu
heb fynediad i ardd.
Mae’n bwysig cofio gwarchod eich meddwl yn ogystal â’ch corff, a cheisio
cefnogaeth os oes ei hangen arnoch. Cadwch mewn cysylltiad â theulu a
chyfeillion dros y ffôn neu ar gyfryngau cymdeithasol. Yn ogystal, mae
ffynonellau cefnogaeth a gwybodaeth a all helpu, megis gwefan Every Mind
Matters.
Meddyliwch am bethau y gallwch eu gwneud yn ystod eich cyfnod adref. Bu
pobl na chafodd hi’n anodd cwblhau cyfnod adref am wythnos yn cadw eu
hunain yn brysur drwy wneud gweithgareddau megis coginio, darllen, dysgu
ar-lein a gwylio ffilmiau. Os ydych yn teimlo’n ddigon da, gallwch gymryd rhan
mewn ymarfer corff ysgafn yn eich cartref neu ardd.
Mae llawer o bobl yn ei chael hi’n ddefnyddiol atgoffa eu hunain bod yr hyn
maent yn ei wneud yn hynod bwysig. Gyda gobaith, ni fydd unrhyw aelod
o’ch teulu yn dioddef o fwy na symptomau’r ffliw. Fodd bynnag, caiff rhai pobl
eu heffeithio’n ddifrifol gan y coronafeirws, yn arbennig yr henoed a’r rheiny
https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/
https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/
sydd â chyflyrau meddygol penodol. Drwy aros adref, rydych yn diogelu
bywydau eraill, yn ogystal â sicrhau nad yw’r GIG yn cael ei llethu.
Terfynu hunan-ynysu ac ynysu’r aelwyd
Os ydych wedi profi symptomau, cewch derfynu eich cyfnod hunan-ynysu ar
ôl 7 diwrnod.
Mae’r cyfnod 7 diwrnod yn dechrau y diwrnod cyntaf yr aethoch yn sâl
Os ydych yn byw gydag eraill, yna gall holl aelodau’r aelwyd sy’n parhau i fod
mewn iechyd da derfynu’r ynysiad aelwyd ar ôl 14 diwrnod. Mae’r cyfnod 14
diwrnod yn dechrau y diwrnod yr aeth yr unigolyn cyntaf yn y tŷ yn sâl.
Pedwar diwrnod ar ddeg yw’r cyfnod deori ar gyfer y coronafeirws; mae pobl
sy’n parhau i fod mewn iechyd da ar ôl 14 diwrnod yn annhebygol o fod yn
heintus.
Ar ôl 7 diwrnod, os yw’r unigolyn cyntaf i fynd yn sâl yn teimlo’n well ac os
nad oes ganddo dymheredd bellach, yna gall ddychwelyd i’w drefn arferol.
Os bydd unrhyw aelod arall o’r teulu yn mynd yn sâl yn ystod cyfnod ynysu’r
aelwyd o 14 diwrnod, dylai ddilyn yr un cyngor - h.y. ar ôl 7 diwrnod o’i
symptomau yn dechrau, os ydyw’n teimlo’n well ac nad oes ganddo
dymheredd uchel bellach, gall hefyd ddychwelyd i’w drefn arferol.
Petai aelod o’r aelwyd yn datblygu symptomau’r coronafeirws yn hwyr yng
nghyfnod ynysu’r aelwyd o 14 diwrnod (e.e. ar ddiwrnod 13 neu 14), nid oes
angen ymestyn y cyfnod ynysu, ond mae’n rhaid i’r unigolyn sydd â’r
symptomau newydd aros adref am 7 diwrnod.
Bydd cyfnod ynysu’r aelwyd o 14 diwrnod wedi lleihau’n sylweddol y maint
cyffredinol o’r haint y gallai gweddill yr aelwyd ei drosglwyddo, ac nid yw’n
hanfodol ailddechrau’r cyfnod ynysu o 14 diwrnod ar gyfer yr aelwyd gyfan.
Bydd hyn wedi cyflawni amddiffyniad cymunedol o lefel uchel. Byddai cyfnod
ynysu ychwanegol i aelodau’r aelwyd yn cyflawni dim ond peth amddiffyniad
cymunedol ychwanegol.
Ar ddiwedd y cyfnod ynysu o 14 diwrnod, gall unrhyw aelod o’r teulu nad yw
wedi bod yn sâl adael cyfnod ynysu’r aelwyd.
Os nad yw unigolyn sy’n sâl yn yr aelwyd wedi gwella o gwbl ac nad yw
eisoes wedi ceisio cyngor meddygol, dylid cysylltu â 111 y GIG ar-lein. Os
nad oes gennych fynediad at y rhyngrwyd yn eich cartref, dylech ffonio 111 y
GIG.

Gall y peswch barhau am sawl wythnos yn achos rhai unigolion, er bod yr
haint coronafeirws wedi clirio. Nid yw peswch parhaus yn unig yn golygu bod
rhaid i rywun barhau i hunan-ynysu am fwy na 7 diwrnod.

COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirements
We face an unprecedented challenge in the weeks and months ahead to provide health and social
care services that meet the needs of people affected by coronavirus (COVID-19).
One of the most important tasks will be to ensure we have the capacity to support people who
have acute healthcare needs in our hospitals. To do this we need to organise the safe and rapid
discharge of those people who no longer need to be in a hospital bed. The new default will be dis-
charge home today.
Strategic Coordination Groups across the NHS, community and social care settings need to ensure
we create and maintain acute bed capacity through faster rates of appropriate discharge from NHS
beds for the foreseeable future.
Today we publish Hospital Discharge Service Requirements, which set out actions that must be
taken immediately to enhance discharge arrangements and the provision of community support.
Each system will tackle this challenge from a different starting position and should take account of
their local workforce and care home/domiciliary care supply dynamics, together with awareness of
the capacity of family carers and volunteers in the community to continue to support local action.
Supporting and sustaining social care will never be more vital to these efforts.
A range of virtual resources and live interactive sessions have been developed to support every
sector to work through how to achieve this new way of operating and are detailed in the document.

What to do if you have symptoms
Stay at home for 7 days if you have either:
a high temperature
a new continuous cough
if you live with other people, they should stay at home for 14 days from the day the first person got symptoms.
This will help to protect others in your community while you are infectious.
Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.
You do not need to contact NHS 111 to tell them you’re staying at home.
Testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home.
Read the guidance about staying at home.
Number of cases
As of 9am on 21 March 2020, 72,818 people have been tested in the UK, of which 67,800 were confirmed negative and 5,018 were confirmed positive.
As of 9am, 233 patients in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) have died.
Cases identified in England
Confirmed cases in each local authority and NHS region are published by Public Health England (PHE).
Risk level
The risk to the UK has been raised to high.
Recent government action
The government published its coronavirus action plan on 3 March.
On 10 February, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, announced strengthened legal powers to protect public health.
The Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 have been put in place to reduce the risk of further human-to-human transmission in this country by keeping individuals in isolation where public health professionals believe there is a reasonable risk an individual may have the virus.

NHS England and NHS Improvement
Publications approval reference: 001559
10 March 2020
This is the second of a series of regular updates to general practice regarding the
emerging COVID-19 situation. An electronic copy of this letter, and all other relevant
guidance from NHS England and NHS Improvement can be found here:
www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
Dear colleagues
We recognise that preparing for COVID-19 and managing concerns arising is taking
up significant time for you all.
COVID-19 Home Management Service (CHMS)
We have taken urgent measures to commission a COVID-19 Home Management
Service (CHMS) in all parts of England, to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a
week.
Patients with COVID-19 were previously isolated in hospitals, regardless of the
severity of their symptoms. To reduce the burden on primary and secondary care,
patients who are suitable for home management are now being self-isolated in the
community and will be supported through this service.
CHMS will provide urgent primary care services to patients diagnosed with
COVID-19 who are self-isolating in the community. This will include care for
symptoms related to COVID-19 as well as care for other conditions.
The CHMS provider will keep GP practices up to date with any changes in your
patient’s health status and will discharge the patient back into your care after the
patient has subsequently tested negative or after an elapsed time period.
The patient’s care will be provided by the CHMS service provider. In most cases this
will be an existing local out-of-hours service provider but may also be an alternative
provider from a different locality or a digital first provider depending on local
arrangements.
To support CHMS service providers’ ability to look up and contact GP practices with
updates to the health status of their patients receiving CHMS care, we have shared
with all CHMS providers a list of all GP practice email addresses in England. The
emails have been sourced from MHRA Central Alerting System and the use by
CHMS providers will be specific and limited to updating your practice about your
patients.
https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
According to PHE, COVID-19 patient categories are as follows:
• Category 1 – Require immediate admission
• Category 2 – Home isolation with active health monitoring
• Category 3 – Home isolation with health advice.
The CHMS will be responsible for providing medical treatment, care and support to
Category 2 and 3 patients, including any home visiting. The service will continue until
the patient is discharged and referred back to their GP.
Patients in Category 2 are at increased risk of complications from COVID-19. These
patients will receive daily communication from a CHMS healthcare professional,
initially by telephone, switching to SMS or other digital communication when feasible
and if appropriate for the individual patient. Category 3 patients will be provided with
advice and invited to contact the CHMS if they develop breathing problems, or other
health concerns. All patients under care of a CHMS provider will be able to contact
the CHMS with any health concerns at any time, 24/7.
There is likely to be a gradual handover of patients to CHMS providers as they come
onstream to provide the service from the North East Ambulance Service. As soon as
the new service is up and running in your area, your CCG will be able to tell you who
will be providing care for patients in your locality.
The CHMS service will be kept under review as the situation develops, with further
updates provided through this communication channel.
Use of NHS111
The current case definition for COVID-19 is on our website:
www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
We have received some reports of cases that do not fulfil this condition being
referred to NHS 111 as possible cases.
People who do not meet the latest case definition for COVID-19 should not be
referred to NHS 111, but directed to general information and advice at
www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/
Patients who do not present as COVID-19, who would otherwise be treated in the
GP, pharmacy, or community settings, should continue to be offered these services
and not unnecessarily referred to NHS 111. Practices may consider how to offer
these services remotely via phone or video.
Online consultations in general practice
We will be supporting CCGs, LMCs and practices to ensure 100% coverage, and
increased use, of online consultations and remote triage in general practice to support
infection control and protect staff and patients. Around 50% of GP practices have an
online consultation system in place. Rapid steps will be taken to:
http://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/primary-care/
http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/
• increase use of existing online consultation systems
• set up new systems where they are not already in place
• enable video consultation capability (d) provide support to implement remote
consultations.
Further advice on online consultations is available here: www.england.nhs.uk/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/online-consultations-summary-tocolkit-for-practices-dec-
2019.pdf
Reviewing current GP services in preparation for any need to release capacity
We are taking steps to review the broad spectrum of current GP services to assess
how additional capacity might be released if required. Similar work is also taking
place across the other primary care professions. Further information will follow in due
course should such steps need to be taken.
Monitoring and annual reviews of vulnerable patients
We recognise that you may be wondering whether to bring in some patients face to
face for annual reviews or regular monitoring. There may be circumstances in which
you judge that the balance of risk and benefit makes it essential that these should be
offered remotely using telephone or digital channels, without any face-to-face
component, rather than cancelling. This allows for important patient care to go ahead
and, at this stage, the NHS will deem these to have fulfilled the requirements of the
Quality Outcomes Framework if coded as usual.
Death certification process
Prior to more detailed guidance being released for the death certification process in
an emergency scenario, please follow these recommendations:
• COVID-19 is an acceptable direct or underlying cause of death for the
purposes
of completing the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death.
• COVID-19 is not a reason on its own to refer a death to a coroner under the
Coroners and Justice Act 2009.
• That COVID-19 is a notifiable disease under the Health Protection
(Notification) Regulations 2010 does not mean referral to a coroner is required
by virtue of its notifiable status.
• Where next of kin/informant are following self-isolation procedures, please
arrange for an alternative informant who has not been in contact with the
patient to collect the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death and deliver to the
registrar for registration purposes.

Reporting accessibility problems with this website
If you find any problems that are not listed on this page or you think we’re not meeting the accessibility requirements, contact us.
Enforcement procedure
If you contact us with a complaint and you’re not happy with our response contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS).
The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’).
Technical information about this website’s accessibility
The Government Digital Service is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard.
Non-accessible content
The content that is not accessible is outlined below with details of:
where it fails the success criteria
planned dates for when issues will be fixed
Some non-English pages have attachments in more than one language, and the language for the attachments is not identified, nor indicated within the files. This fails WCAG 2.1A 3.1.1 success criterion (Language of Page). We plan to fix this by September 2020.
A small number of pages have content in different languages where the language is not identified. This fails WCAG 2.1A 3.1.1 success criterion (Language of Page). We plan to fix this by October 2019.
Some tables in content do not have table row headers when needed. This fails WCAG 2.1A 1.3.1 success criterion (Info and Relationships). This is a limitation of the publishing tool which we plan to fix by October 2019.
Focused links and buttons sometimes do not have enough contrast. This fails WCAG 1.4.11 AA (Non-text Contrast). We plan to fix this by October 2019.
Disproportionate burden
Not applicable
Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations
The following content does not need to comply with the accessibility requirement until September 2020, because it was published before September 2018.
Images on pages do not always have suitable alternative text. Some images are missing alternative text, some have incomplete text and some have ‘placeholder’ as alternative text. This fails WCAG 1.1.1A success criterion (Non-text Content). We plan to identify and fix these by September 2020.
Headings on some pages are not in a logical nested order. We plan to identify and fix these by September 2020.
In addition to the pages identified above, some other pages have content in different languages where the language is not identified. This fails WCAG 2.1 A 3.1.1 success criterion (Language of Page). We plan to identify and fix these by September 2020.
Buttons on some pages do not have a correct role identified, which affects how they work with assistive technology. This fails WCAG 2.1A success criterion (Name, Role, Value). We plan to identify and fix these by September 2020.
Error messages on some forms are unclear or lack clear association with particular form controls. This fails WCAG 2.1A 3.3.1 success criterion (Error Identification).
Guidance will be created to help content authors understand the requirements for captions and audio description for all new videos. This is related to WCAG 2.1A success criteria 1.2.2 (Captions (Prerecorded)) and 1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded).

Supporting allied health professionals and allied health professional support
workers during the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK
As we enter unprecedented times in the NHS and wider health and social care services, we
wanted to write to you firstly to thank you for the exceptionally hard work you and your staff
are doing and secondly to offer you our support.
The World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic, and
the Prime Minister has declared that the UK is moving into the delay phase of fighting the
virus, which will put the NHS and wider health and care services of all four nations under
extreme pressure. This pressure will inevitably be exacerbated by staff shortages due to
sickness or caring responsibilities. It will be a challenge, but we are confident that allied
health professionals (AHPs) and their support workforce will respond rapidly and
professionally. We want to assure colleagues that we recognise this will require temporary
changes to practice and that regulators and others will take this into account.
A significant epidemic will require healthcare professionals to be flexible in what they do. It
may entail working in unfamiliar circumstances or surroundings or working in clinical areas
outside their usual practice for the benefit of patients, individuals and the population as a
whole. This can be stressful, and we recognise that you may have concerns about both the
professional practicalities and implications of working in such circumstances.
We need to keep to the basic principles of AHP best practice. As registered AHPs, you are
expected to follow Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) and General Osteopathic
Council (GOsC) guidance and use judgement in applying the principles to situations that you
may face. However, these also take account of the realities of a very abnormal emergency
situation. We want AHPs, in partnership with patients and individuals we care for, to use
their professional judgement to assess risk and to make sure people receive safe care,
informed by the values and principles in our professional standards of conduct, performance
and ethics. A rational approach to varying practice in an emergency is part of that
professional response.
It is the responsibility of the organisations in which you work to ensure you are supported to
do this. They must bear in mind that clinicians may need to depart, possibly significantly,
from established procedures to care for people in the unique and highly challenging but time-
bound circumstances of the peak of an epidemic.
We expect employers, educationalists, professional bodies and national NHS organisations
to be flexible in terms of their approach and the expectations of routine requirements.
Healthcare professional regulators, including the HCPC and GOsC have already committed
to take into account factors relevant to the environment in which the professional is working.
Due consideration should and will be given to AHPs and other staff who are using their skills
under difficult circumstances due to lack of personnel and overwhelming demand in a major
epidemic. This may include working outside an individual's scope of practice. The healthcare
regulators have already released a joint statement to explain this:

coronavirus/
and https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/news/joint-statement-
covid-19-coronavirus/
We are also determined to ensure the long-term education of students is not compromised.
This will be given appropriate consideration by all the relevant bodies.
Finally, we would like to thank you all for the efforts you are already making. Many AHPs and
their support staff across the NHS and public health services have made major contributions
to the response to COVID-19. We are very proud of the response of the professions in all
areas of practice in their response to this challenge. It has been exemplary. We are
confident of the commitment, dedication, professionalism and hard work that the AHP
workforce has and will continue to have over the course of this significant pandemic.
Yours sincerely

How government works
In the UK, the Prime Minister leads the government with the support of the Cabinet and ministers. You can find out who runs government and how government is run, as well as learning about the history of government.
Who runs government
The Prime Minister
The Prime Minister is the leader of Her Majesty’s Government and is ultimately responsible for all policy and decisions.
The Prime Minister also:
oversees the operation of the Civil Service and government agencies
appoints members of the government
is the principal government figure in the House of Commons
The Prime Minister is The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP.
Read more about the Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is made up of the senior members of government. Every week during Parliament, members of the Cabinet (Secretaries of State from all departments and some other ministers) meet to discuss the most important issues for the government.
See who is in the Cabinet
Ministers
Ministers are chosen by the Prime Minister from the members of the House of Commons and House of Lords. They are responsible for the actions, successes and failures of their departments.
See full list of ministers
How government is run
Government departments and agencies
Departments and their agencies are responsible for putting government policy into practice.
24
Ministerial departments
20
Non-ministerial departments
300+
Agencies & other public bodies
Government departments
Some departments, like the Ministry of Defence, cover the
whole UK. Others don’t – the Department for Work and Pensions doesn't cover Northern Ireland. This is because some aspects of government are devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Non-ministerial departments are headed by senior civil servants and not ministers. They usually have a regulatory or inspection function like the Charity Commission.
Executive agencies
These are part of government departments and usually provide government services rather than decide policy - which is done by the department that oversees the agency.
An example is the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (overseen by the Department for Transport).
Other public bodies
These have varying degrees of independence but are directly accountable to ministers. There are 4 types of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs).
Executive NDPBs do work for the government in specific areas - for example, the Environment Agency.
Advisory NDPBs provide independent, expert advice to ministers - for example, the Committee on Standards in Public Life.
Tribunal NDPBs are part of the justice system and have jurisdiction over a specific area of law - for example, the Competition Appeal Tribunal.
Independent monitoring boards are responsible for the running of prisons and treatment of prisoners - for example, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons.
Civil Service
The Civil Service does the practical and administrative work of government. It is co-ordinated and managed by the Prime Minister, in their role as Minister for the Civil Service.
Around half of all civil servants provide services direct to the public, including:
paying benefits and pensions
running employment services
staffing prisons
issuing driving licences
The Civil Service is on GOV.UK.

Get involved
Read about ways to get involved.
Engage with government
Interact with government through consultations and petitions to inform and influence the decisions it makes.
Take part
Offer your skills and energy to a project in your neighbourhood, around the UK or overseas.
Legislation
Laws go through several stages before they are passed by Parliament. The House of Commons and the House of Lords work together to make them.
They can include:
Draft legislation
White papers outline proposals for new laws. Green papers ask for public comments before the white paper is published.
Bills are proposals for new laws or changes to existing ones. Once agreed by Parliament, they have to be approved by The Queen before becoming law.
Acts of Parliament
These are bills which have been approved by the Commons, the Lords, and The Queen. The relevant government department is responsible for putting the act into practice.
Visit www.legislation.gov.uk
Access to information
Freedom of information
The Freedom of Information Act gives you the right to ask any public sector organisation for all the recorded information it has on any subject. Anyone can make a request for information – known as a Freedom of Information (or FOI) request.
There are no restrictions on your age, nationality or where you live.
How to make a freedom of information request
See FOI releases on GOV.UK
Statistics
Government produces Official Statistics about most areas of public life. Statistics are used by people inside and outside government to make informed decisions and to measure the success of government policies and services. Find out about the legislation that governs the publication of UK national and Official Statistics.
See statistics publications on GOV.UK
Transparency
The government publishes information about how government works to allow you to make politicians, public services and public organisations more accountable. We are committed to publishing information about:
how much public money has been spent on what
the job titles of senior civil servants and how much they are paid
how the government is doing against its objectives
See transparency releases on GOV.UK
Data
Putting data in people’s hands can help them have more of a say in the reform of public services. On data.gov.uk you can easily find, review and use information about our country and communities - for example, to develop web applications.
Devolved government
In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, devolved administrations are responsible for many domestic policy issues, and their Parliaments/Assemblies have law-making powers for those areas.
Areas the Scottish Government, Welsh Government, and the Northern Ireland Executive are responsible for, include:
health
education
culture
the environment
transport
Local government
Councils make and carry out decisions on local services. Many parts of England have 2 tiers of local government: county councils and district, borough or city councils.
In some parts of the country, there’s just one tier of local government providing all the functions, known as a ‘unitary authority’. This can be a city, borough or county council – or it may just be called ‘council’. As well as these, many areas also have parish or town councils.
Understand how your council works
Parliament
Parliament is separate from government. Made up of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, its role is to:
look at what the government is doing
debate issues and pass new laws
set taxes
Find out about how Parliament works
Read The Official Report at Hansard
History of government
Britain has one of the oldest governments in the world. Find out more about how it has worked and who has shaped it in the history section.

Coronavirus (COVID-19)
Contents
Overview
Stay at home advice
COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways. It's caused by a virus called coronavirus.
Stay at home if you have coronavirus symptoms
Stay at home if you have either:
a high temperature – this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)
a new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual)
To protect others, do not go to places like a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. Stay at home.
Use the 111 online coronavirus service to find out what to do.
Use the 111 coronavirus service
Information:
Only call 111 if you cannot get help online.
How long to stay at home
if you have symptoms of coronavirus, you'll need to stay at home for 7 days
if you live with someone who has symptoms, you'll need to stay at home for 14 days from the day the first person in the home started having symptoms
If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.
If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.
Read our advice about staying at home.
How to avoid catching and spreading coronavirus (social distancing)
Everyone should do what they can to stop coronavirus spreading.
Do
wash your hands with soap and water often – do this for at least 20 seconds
always wash your hands when you get home or into work
use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available
cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze
put used tissues in the bin immediately and wash your hands afterwards
avoid close contact with people who have symptoms of coronavirus
only travel on public transport if you need to
work from home, if you can
avoid social activities, such as going to pubs, restaurants, theatres and cinemas
avoid events with large groups of people
use phone, online services, or apps to contact your GP surgery or other NHS services
Don't
do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean
do not have visitors to your home, including friends and family
Advice for people at high risk
If you're at high risk of getting seriously ill from coronavirus, there are extra things you should do to avoid catching it.
These include:
not leaving your home – you should not go out to do shopping, visit friends or family, or attend any gatherings
avoiding close contact with other people in your home as much as possible
Read the full advice on protecting yourself if you're at high risk from coronavirus on GOV.UK.
Who is at high risk?
You may be at high risk from coronavirus if you:
have had an organ transplant
are having certain types of cancer treatment
have blood or bone marrow cancer, such as leukaemia
have a severe lung condition, such as cystic fibrosis or severe asthma
have a condition that makes you much more likely to get infections
are taking medicine that weakens your immune system
are pregnant and have a serious heart condition
Information:
If you're at high risk, you will be contacted by the NHS by Sunday 29 March 2020. Do not contact your GP or healthcare team at this stage – wait to be contacted.
How coronavirus is spread
Because it's a new illness, we do not know exactly how coronavirus spreads from person to person.
Similar viruses are spread in cough droplets.
It's very unlikely it can be spread through things like packages or food.
Pregnancy advice
If you're pregnant and worried about coronavirus, you can get advice about coronavirus and pregnancy from the Royal College of Obstretricians and Gynaecologists.
Travel advice
There are some countries and areas where there's a higher chance of coming into contact with someone with coronavirus.
If you're planning to travel abroad and are concerned about coronavirus, see advice for travellers on GOV.UK.
Treatment for coronavirus
There is currently no specific treatment for coronavirus.
Antibiotics do not help, as they do not work against viruses.
Treatment aims to relieve the symptoms while your body fights the illness.
You'll need to stay in isolation, away from other people, until you have recovered.

Social media and comment moderation policy
Comments received via the NHS England website
Twitter
We encourage and welcome open, lively debate, but the decision to publish comments received via this site and our YouTube channel remains at our discretion. The views expressed by any third parties are solely theirs and are not necessarily endorsed by NHS England.
Comments on all pages may be closed after 4 weeks.
Moderation Policy
We ask you to please bear in mind our guidelines when submitting comments.
Where views have been sought, all comments will be considered before the response is published.
Moderation guidelines
We pre-moderate all of the comments we receive.
‘Pre-moderation’ means that comments will not be published instantly. Comments will be checked first by moderators who will monitor the site during normal working hours (0900 – 1700, GMT, Monday to Friday) and aim to process comments as quickly as possible.
This is not about censoring your views. The aim is to ensure that comments relate to the particular subject being discussed. Moderation will not be used to suppress legitimate, reasoned discussion.
Sometimes there is a delay in publishing whilst we seek information from various sources to be included in our response to questions.
We will normally approve comments for publication as long as they:
are on-topic. Please don’t post messages that are not related
respect other people. Comments should not be malicious or offensive in nature, and should not constitute a personal attack on a person’s character
don’t incite hatred on the basis of race, religion, gender, nationality or sexuality or any other personal characteristic
don’t reveal personal details, such as private addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or other online contact details
are reasonably concise, and don’t constitute spamming of the site
are not persistent or repetitive negative messages which aim to provoke a response and/or don’t constructively add to the conversation
don’t impersonate or falsely claim to represent a person or organisation
are not party political in nature. The NHS is always high on the political agenda, and whilst we acknowledge that references to political parties and their policies may often be inevitable, we reserve the right to exclude comments which are purely party-political in nature or seek to advertise political events.
don’t include swearing, hate-speech or obscenity
don’t break the law – this includes libel, condoning illegal activity, and breaking copyright
don’t advertise commercial products and services – you can mention relevant products and services as long as they support your comment
are in English – unfortunately, we do not currently have the resource to moderate comments in other languages
if you are aged 16 or under, please get you parent/guardian’s permission before submitting a comment. Users without this consent are not allowed to participate or provide us with personal information.
We reserve the right to suspend comments at any time, and remove comments older than six months. Where we choose not to publish a comment for a reason other than those listed above, we will reply to the commenter by email explaining our reason and inviting them to make appropriate changes so that the comment can be reconsidered.
We read every comment, and respond wherever we can. We endeavour to answer your questions where possible, but if you require an official response you should contact NHS England by post or email.
Twitter
NHS England uses Twitter, a free messaging service offered by a third party, as one tool in its efforts to communicate clearly, quickly and in an engaging manner to people interested in our work. You can follow us @NHSEngland
Twitter content delivered by NHS England includes (but is not limited to):
links to news releases, blog posts, videos, guidance and other approved, publicly available NHS England material
links to relevant information produced and published elsewhere (work of other NHS organisations, patient organisations, researchers, news organisations and others). This can include videos, blog posts, and retweets (RTs) from other Twitter users. (See below for our policy on RTs.)
interesting facts, quotes or observations related to our work
topical questions related to our work intended to provoke discussion
Retweets (RTs)
Tweets we repeat (RT) do not imply endorsement on the part of NHS England. We may retweet news, links and personal observations we believe are relevant to the work we do.
Twitter as a source of official policy
Tweets should not be considered as the authoritative source of new policy or guidance from NHS England. Any change or evolution in NHS England’s official position on legislation, guidance, investigations and audits will be communicated through more traditional channels: official publications and statements on our website, speeches, and media releases.
Importantly, our decision to RT should not be taken as explicit endorsement of any position or argument that may vary from NHS England’s current official position, nor should it be taken as an indication of a possible shift in the current official position.
Following
NHS England’s decision to follow a particular Twitter user does not imply endorsement of any kind. We follow accounts on Twitter we believe are relevant to our work. This could include following the Twitter accounts of companies and other commercial enterprises (and/or their employees) who comment on NHS England related issues.
Availability
We commit to updating and monitoring our Twitter account during regular office hours: 0900 – 1700, GMT. However, like many Twitter users, we may monitor and respond at other times of the day. We accept no responsibility for lack of service due to Twitter downtime.
@Replies and Direct Messages
We will read all @replies and Direct Messages sent to us and, when possible, will respond to them. Please note that, due to the volume of traffic on our Twitter account, it is not always possible to respond and we encourage users to use other ways to contact us if their question or comment requires urgent attention.
Complaints, Media Requests and Personal Issues
We encourage you to follow traditional channels to make a media request, freedom of information (FOI) request or complaint. See details of other ways to contact us.
NHS England Staff Tweeting
Some NHS England staff tweet under their own names or pseudonyms. Despite their professional affiliation with NHS England, their tweets do not represent the official position of the Board, and should be considered the product of each individual as a private citizen.

Background and scope of guidance
This guidance is for people, including children, who are at very high risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19) because of an underlying health condition, and for their family, friends and carers. It is intended for use in situations where the extremely vulnerable person is living in their own home, with or without additional support. This includes the extremely clinically vulnerable people living in long-term care facilities, either for the elderly or persons with special needs.
Shielding is a measure to protect people who are clinically extremely vulnerable by minimising all interaction between those who are extremely vulnerable and others. We are strongly advising people with serious underlying health conditions (listed below) which put them at very high risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19) to rigorously follow shielding measures in order to keep themselves safe.
What do we mean by extremely vulnerable?
People falling into this extremely vulnerable group include:
Solid organ transplant recipients
People with specific cancers:
people with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radical radiotherapy for lung cancer
people with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment
people having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for cancer
people having other targeted cancer treatments which can affect the immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors
people who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last 6 months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs
People with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and severe COPD.
People with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that significantly increase the risk of infections (such as SCID, homozygous sickle cell).
People on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly increase risk of infection.
Women who are pregnant with significant heart disease, congenital or acquired.
Shielding is for your personal protection, it is your choice to decide whether to follow the measures we advise. Individuals who have been given a prognosis of less than 6 months to live, and some others in special circumstances, could decide not to undertake shielding. This will be a deeply personal decision. We advise calling your GP or specialist to discuss this.
The NHS in England is directly contacting people with these conditions to provide further advice.
If you think you fall into one of the categories of extremely vulnerable people listed above and you have not received a letter by Sunday 29 March 2020 or been contacted by your GP, you should discuss your concerns with your GP or hospital clinician.
We understand this is an anxious time and people considered extremely vulnerable will understandably have questions and concerns. Plans are being readied to make sure you can rely on a wide range of help and support.
What you need to know
If you have an underlying health condition listed above, you are at very high risk of severe illness as a result of coronavirus (COVID-19) requiring admission to hospital.
Shielding is a practice used to protect extremely vulnerable people from coming into contact with coronavirus.
You are strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact for a period of at least 12 weeks from the day you receive your letter. Please note that this period of time could change.
Visits from people who provide essential support to you such as healthcare, personal support with your daily needs or social care should continue, but carers and care workers must stay away if they have any of the symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). You may find this guidance on home care provision useful. All people coming to your home should wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds on arrival to your house and often whilst they are there.
You should have an alternative list of people who can help you with your care if your main carer becomes unwell. You can also contact your local council for advice on how to access care.
If you think you have developed symptoms of COVID-19 such as a new, continuous cough or fever, seek clinical advice using the NHS 111 online coronavirus service or call NHS 111. Do this as soon as you get symptoms.
If you have someone else living with you, they are not required to adopt these protective shielding measures for themselves. They should do what they can to support you in shielding and they should stringently follow guidance on social distancing, reducing their contact outside the home. If you care for but don’t actually live with someone who is extremely vulnerable you should still stringently follow guidance on social distancing.
How do these measures differ from the social distancing guidance for vulnerable people issued?
You are strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact for a period of at least 12 weeks from the day you receive your letter.
People who are not clinically extremely vulnerable who have contracted coronavirus (COVID-19) and recovered will be able to go about their normal business. If you are in this group we strongly advise that you should remain at home at all times.
Symptoms
The most common symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) are recent onset of:
new continuous cough and/or
high temperature (above 37.8 °C)
What is shielding?
Shielding is a measure to protect extremely vulnerable people by minimising interaction between those who are extremely vulnerable and others. This means that those who are extremely vulnerable should not leave their homes, and within their homes should minimise all non-essential contact with other members of their household. This is to protect those who are at very high risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19) from coming into contact with the virus.
If you think you have a condition which makes you extremely vulnerable or have received a letter from NHS England you are strongly advised to shield yourself, to reduce the chance of getting coronavirus (COVID-19) and follow the face-to-face distancing measures below.
The measures are:
Strictly avoid contact with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). These symptoms include high temperature and/or new and continuous cough.
Do not leave your house.
Do not attend any gatherings. This includes gatherings of friends and families in private spaces for example family homes, weddings and religious services.
Do not go out for shopping, leisure or travel and, when arranging food or medication deliveries, these should be left at the door to minimise contact.
Keep in touch using remote technology such as phone, internet, and social media.
Do use telephone or online services to contact your GP or other essential services.
We know that stopping these activities will be difficult. You should try to identify ways of staying in touch with others and participating in your normal activities remotely from your home. However, you must not participate in alternative activities if they involve any contact with other people.
This advice will be in place for at least 12 weeks from the day you receive your letter.
What should you do if you have someone else living with you?
Whilst the rest of your household are not required to adopt these protective shielding measures for themselves, we would expect them to do what they can to support you in shielding and to stringently follow guidance on social distancing.
Minimise as much as possible the time other family members spend in shared spaces such as kitchens, bathrooms and sitting areas, and keep shared spaces well ventilated.
Aim to keep 2 metres (3 steps) away from people you live with and encourage them to sleep in a different bed where possible. If you can, you should use a separate bathroom from the rest of the household. Make sure you use separate towels from the other people in your house, both for drying themselves after bathing or showering and for hand-hygiene purposes.
If you do share a toilet and bathroom with others, it is important that they are cleaned after use every time (for example, wiping surfaces you have come into contact with). Another tip is to consider drawing up a rota for bathing, with you using the facilities first.
If you share a kitchen with others, avoid using it while they are present. If you can, you should take your meals back to your room to eat. If you have one, use a dishwasher to clean and dry the family’s used crockery and cutlery. If this is not possible, wash them using your usual washing up liquid and warm water and dry them thoroughly. If you are using your own utensils, remember to use a separate tea towel for drying these.
We understand that it will be difficult for some people to separate themselves from others at home. You should do your very best to follow this guidance and everyone in your household should regularly wash their hands, avoid touching their face, and clean frequently touched surfaces.
If the rest of your household stringently follow advice on social distancing and minimise the risk of spreading the virus within the home by following the advice above, there is no need for them to also shield alongside you.
Handwashing and respiratory hygiene
There are general principles you should follow to help prevent the spread of airway and chest infections caused by respiratory viruses, including:
wash your hands more often - with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use a hand sanitiser. Do this after you blow your nose, sneeze or cough, and after you eat or handle food
avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands
avoid close contact with people who have symptoms
cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in a bin
clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces in the home
What should you do if you develop symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19)?
If you develop symptoms of COVID-19 (high temperature above 37.8 °C and/or new and continuous cough), seek clinical advice using the NHS 111 online coronavirus service or call NHS111 if you don’t have internet access. In an emergency, call 999 if you are seriously ill. Do not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or a hospital. Do this as soon as you get symptoms.
To help the NHS provide you with the best care if you need to go to hospital as a result of catching coronavirus, we ask that you prepare a single hospital bag. This should include your emergency contact, a list of the medications you take (including dose and frequency), any information on your planned care appointments and things you would need for an overnight stay (snacks, pyjamas, toothbrush, medication etc). If you have an advanced care plan, please include that.
How can you get assistance with foods and medicines if you are shielding?
Ask family, friends and neighbours to support you and use online services. If this is not possible, then the public sector, business, charities, and the general public are gearing up to help those advised to stay at home. Please discuss your daily needs during this period of staying at home with carers, family, friends, neighbours or local community groups to see how they can support you. Please visit gov.uk/coronavirus-extremely-vulnerable from Tuesday 24 March 2020 to register for the support that you need. This includes help with food, shopping deliveries and additional care you might need.
The government is helping pharmacies to deliver prescriptions. Prescriptions will continue to cover the same length of time as usual. If you do not currently have your prescriptions collected or delivered, you can arrange this by:
Asking someone who can pick up your prescription from the local pharmacy, (this is the best option, if possible).
Contacting your pharmacy to ask them to help you find a volunteer (who will have been ID checked) or deliver it to you.
You may also need to arrange for collection or delivery of hospital specialist medication that is prescribed to you by your hospital care team.
If you receive support from health and social care organisations, for example, if you have care provided for you through the local authority or health care system, this will continue as normal. Your health or social care provider will be asked to take additional precautions to make sure that you are protected. The advice for formal carers is included in the home care provision.
What should you do if you have hospital and GP appointments during this period?
We advise everyone to access medical assistance remotely, wherever possible. However, if you have a scheduled hospital or other medical appointment during this period, talk to your GP or specialist to ensure you continue to receive the care you need and determine which of these are absolutely essential.
It is possible that your hospital may need to cancel or postpone some clinics and appointments. You should contact your hospital or clinic to confirm appointments.
What is the advice for visitors, including those who are providing care for you?
Contact regular visitors to your home, such as friends and family to let them know that you are shielding and that they should not visit you during this time unless they are providing essential care for you. Essential care includes things like help with washing, dressing, or feeding.
If you receive regular health or social care from an organisation, either through your local authority or paid for by yourself, inform your care providers that you are shielding and agree a plan for continuing your care.
If you receive essential care from friends or family members, speak to your carers about extra precautions they can take to keep you safe. You may find this guidance on home care provision useful.
Speak to your carers about backup plans for your care in case your main carer is unwell and needs to self-isolate. If you need help with care but you’re not sure who to contact, or if you do not have family or friends who can help you, you can contact your local council who will be able to help you and assess any social care needs you might have. Please visit gov.uk/coronavirus-extremely-vulnerable to register for support that you need.
What is the advice for informal carers who provide care for someone who is extremely vulnerable?
If you are caring for someone who is extremely vulnerable due to severe illness from COVID-19, there are some simple steps that you can take to protect them and to reduce their risk at the current time. Ensure you follow advice on good hygiene.
only care that is essential should be provided
wash your hands on arrival and often, using soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser.
cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze
put used tissues in the bin immediately and wash your hands afterwards
do not visit or provide care if you are unwell and make alternative arrangements for their care
provide information on who they should call if they feel unwell, how to use NHS111 online coronavirus service and leave the number for NHS 111 prominently displayed
find out about different sources of support that could be used and accessing further advice on creating a contingency plan is available from Carers UK
look after your own well-being and physical health during this time. Further information on this is available.
How do you look after your mental well-being?
Social isolation, reduction in physical activity, unpredictability and changes in routine can all contribute to increasing stress. Many people including those without existing mental health needs may feel anxious about this impact including support with daily living, ongoing care arrangements with health providers, support with medication and changes in their daily routines.
If you are receiving services for your mental health, learning disability or autism and are worried about the impact of isolation please contact your keyworker/care coordinator or provider to review your care plan. If you have additional needs please contact your key worker or care coordinator to develop a safety or crisis plan.
Understandably, you may find that shielding and distancing can be boring or frustrating. You may find your mood and feelings are affected and you may feel low, worried or have problems sleeping and you might miss being outside with other people.
At times like these, it can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make you feel worse. There are simple things you can do that may help, to stay mentally and physically active during this time such as:
look for ideas of exercises you can do at home on the NHS website
spend time doing things you enjoy – this might include reading, cooking, other indoor hobbies or listening to favourite radio programmes or watching TV
try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals, drink enough water, exercise regularly, and try to avoid smoking, alcohol and drugs
try spending time with the windows open to let in the fresh air, arranging space to sit and see a nice view (if possible) and get some natural sunlight, or get out into any private space, keeping at least 2 metres away from your neighbours and household members if you are sitting on your doorstep
Constantly watching the news can make you feel more worried. If you think it is affecting you, try to limit the time you spend watching, reading, or listening to media coverage of the outbreak. It may help to only check the news at set times or limiting this to a couple of times a day.
Try to focus on the things you can control, such as your behaviour, who you speak to and who you get information from. Every Mind Matters provides simple tips and advice to start taking better care of your mental health.
If you are struggling with your mental health. Please see the NHS mental health and wellbeing advice website for self-assessment, audio guides and tools that you can use.
If you are still struggling after several weeks and it is affecting your daily life, please contact NHS 111 online. If you have no internet access, you should call NHS 111.
What steps can you take to stay connected with family and friends during this time?
Draw on support you might have through your friends, family and other networks during this time. Try to stay in touch with those around you over the phone, by post, or online.
Let people know how you would like to stay in touch and build that into your routine. This is also important in looking after your mental wellbeing and you may find it helpful to talk to them about how you are feeling if you want to.
Remember it is okay to share your concerns with others you trust and in doing so you may end up providing support to them too. Or you might want try an NHS recommended helpline.
What is the advice for people living in long-term care facilities, either for the elderly or persons with special needs?
The advice also applies to extremely vulnerable persons living in long-term care facilities. Care providers should carefully discuss this advice with the families, carers and specialist doctors caring for such persons to ensure this guidance is strictly adhered to.
What is the advice for parents and schools with extremely vulnerable children?
The advice also applies to extremely vulnerable children in mainstream and special schools.

What to do if you have symptoms
Stay at home for 7 days if you have either:
a high temperature
a new continuous cough
if you live with other people, they should stay at home for 14 days from the day the first person got symptoms.
This will help to protect others in your community while you are infectious.
Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.
You do not need to contact NHS 111 to tell them you’re staying at home.
Testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home.
Read the guidance about staying at home.
Number of cases
As of 9am on 21 March 2020, 72,818 people have been tested in the UK, of which 67,800 were confirmed negative and 5,018 were confirmed positive.
As of 9am, 233 patients in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) have died.
Cases identified in England
Confirmed cases in each local authority and NHS region are published by Public Health England (PHE).
Risk level
The risk to the UK has been raised to high.
Recent government action
The government published its coronavirus action plan on 3 March.
On 10 February, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, announced strengthened legal powers to protect public health.
The Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 have been put in place to reduce the risk of further human-to-human transmission in this country by keeping individuals in isolation where public health professionals believe there is a reasonable risk an individual may have the virus.

1. Summary
1.1 This document sets out the Hospital Discharge Service Requirements for all NHS
trusts, community interest companies and private care providers of acute, community
beds and community health services and social care staff in England, who must
adhere to this from Thursday 19th March 2020. It also sets out requirements around
discharge for health and social care commissioners (including Clinical Commissioning
Groups and local authorities).
1.2 Unless required to be in hospital (see Annex B), patients must not remain in an NHS
bed.
1.3 Based on these criteria, acute and community hospitals must discharge all patients as
soon as they are clinically safe to do so.
Transfer from the ward should happen within
one hour of that decision being made to a designated discharge area.
Discharge from
hospital should happen as soon after that as possible, normally within 2 hours.
1.4 Implementing these Service Requirements is expected to free up to at least 15,000
beds by Friday 27th March, with discharge flows maintained after that.
Acute and
community hospitals must keep a list of all those suitable for discharge and report on
the number and percentage of patients on the list who have left the hospital and the
number of delayed discharges through the daily situation report.
1.5 The current legislation does not describe a specific timeframe for carrying out NHS
CHC assessments of eligibility, or for individual requests for a review of an eligibility
decision (i.e. Local Resolution and Independent Review). Therefore, NHS CHC
assessments for individuals on the acute hospital discharge pathway and in
community settings will not be required until the end of the COVID-19 emergency
period. Planned legislative change, as part of the COVID-19 Bill, will further support
the NHS in relation to this.
1.6 The Government has agreed the NHS will fully fund the cost of new or extended out-
of-hospital health and social care support packages, referred to in this guidance. This
applies for people being discharged from hospital or would otherwise be admitted into
it, for a limited time, to enable quick and safe discharge and more generally reduce
pressure on acute services.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement

1.7 Discharge requires teamwork across many people and organisations and the funding
and eligibility blockages that currently exist cannot remain in place during the COVID-
19 emergency period. Therefore, a discharge to assess model will be introduced
across England.
1.8 The discharge-to-assess model is based on using four clear pathways for discharging
patients as shown below
1.9 Acute hospitals will be responsible for leading on the discharge of all patients on
pathway 0, ensuring that the 50% of patients that can leave the hospital and only need
minimal support do so on time.
1.10 Providers of community health services will lead on pathways 1-3 as they will play a
lead role in assessing and providing care for patients once they are home. Community
health providers will need to set up a single coordinator in each acute centre,
accountable to a named Executive Board lead in their own organisation, to ensure
accountability for delivering the change. The co-ordination team will ensure all patients
(irrespective of their address) are discharged on time and are provided with the follow
up support as needed. The Discharge Service needs to operate at a minimum 8am-
8pm, seven days a week. This approach applies to discharges from all NHS
community and acute beds.
Figure 1: Discharge to Assess model
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
5
1.11 The discharge to assess pathways 1-3 will only be successful if NHS organisations
work hand in glove with adult social care colleagues, the care sector and the voluntary
sector.
1.12 Whilst most people will be discharged to their homes, a very small proportion will
need and benefit from short or long term residential or nursing home care. The
Discharge Service will be able to access live information from a national community
bed tracker system. The existing North of England Commissioning Support (NECS)
care home tracker will be extended to cover all care home places, all NHS community
hospital beds and hospice beds. All providers must sign up and start using the tracker
by 23 March 2020 (see Annex F).
1.13 The following sections detail what these changes mean for all health and care
sectors with a role in hospital discharge and provide clarity on the actions
organisations needs to take straightaway. This information will be supplemented by
specific action cards outlining how key roles should work differently during this period,
which will be published separately and discussed as part of webinar sessions on these
changes (see section 12).
1.14 There needs to be clear accountability and escalation mechanisms at each stage of
the discharge-to-assess process in each locality (see Annex H).
1.15 The diagram on the following page describes the discharge to asses process that
should be undertaken in acute and community hospitals and once the patient is home.
1.16 NHS England and NHS Improvement are grateful for input from The Academy of
Medical Royal Colleges and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services into
this guidance.

2. What does this mean for patients?
2.1 Patients will still receive high quality care from acute and community hospitals, but
will not be able to stay in a bed as soon as this is no longer necessary. For 95% of
patients leaving hospital this will mean that (where it is needed), the assessment
and organising of ongoing care will take place when they are in their own home.
Leaflet A, describing these COVID-19 arrangements, is provided in Annex D and
should be shared with all patients on admission to hospital.
2.2 On the day a patient is to be discharged patient, (following discussions with the
patient, their family and any other professionals involved in their care using leaflets
B1/B2 in Annex D), within one hour the ward will arrange to escort the patient to
the hospital discharge lounge, so their acute bed can be immediately used by
someone being admitted who is acutely unwell.
2.3 Within two hours of arriving in the discharge lounge, transport home, any volunteer
and voluntary sector support and immediate practical measures, such as shopping
and the heating turning on, will be organised by the discharge co-ordinators for
those who have no one else to do this.
2.4 A lead professional or multidisciplinary team, as is suitable for the level of care
needs, will visit patients at home on the day of discharge or the day after to
arrange what support is needed in the home environment and rapidly arrange for
that to be put in place. If care support is needed on the day of discharge from
hospital, this will have been arranged prior to the patient leaving the hospital site,
by a care coordinator.
2.5 For patients whose needs are too great to return to their own home (about 5% of
patients admitted to hospital) a suitable rehabilitation bed or care home will be
arranged. During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients will not be able to wait in
hospital until their first choice of care home has a vacancy. This will mean a short
spell in an alternative care home and the care coordinators will follow up to ensure
patients are able to move as soon as possible to their long term care home.
2.6 During the COVID-19 pandemic, all of the above support will be paid for by the
NHS, to ensure patients move on from their acute hospital stay as quickly as
possible.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement

3. What are the actions for acute care
organisations and staff?
‘Why not home, why not today?’
Acute providers need to rapidly update their processes and ways of working to deliver the
discharge-to- assess model.
3.1 Ward level:
• Clinically-led review of all patients at an early morning board round. Any
patient meeting the revised clinical criteria will be deemed suitable for
discharge
• At least twice daily review of all patients in acute beds to agree who is not
required to be in hospital, and will therefore be discharged
• Ensure professional and clinical leadership between nursing, medicine and
allied health professions for managing decisions and use prompts in the box
below:
• All patients who are not required to be in hospital and are therefore suitable
for discharge will be added to the discharge list and allocated to a discharge
pathway. Discharge home today should be the default pathway
• On decision of discharge, the patient and their family or carer, and any formal
supported housing workers should be informed and receive the relevant
leaflet (see Annex D).
➢ Does the person require the level of care that
they are receiving, or can it be provided in
another setting?
➢ What value are we adding for the person
balanced against the risks of being away from
home?
➢ What do they need next?
➢ ‘Why not home, why not today’ for those who
have not reached a point where long-term 24-
hour care is required.
➢ If not home today, then when? – Expected date
of discharge from bed.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
9
• Individuals and their families must be fully informed of the next steps
• Transfer off the ward into a discharge lounge within one hour of decision to
discharge
• Social care colleagues should be involved in daily ward reviews. This will
help with the early identification of any possible support, placement or
housing issues with discharge and allow the MDT to undertake arrangements
in good time.
3.2 Hospital Discharge Teams:
• Arrange dedicated staff to support and manage all patients on pathway 0.
This will include:
• co-ordinating with transport providers
• local voluntary sector and volunteering groups helping to ensure
patients are supported (where needed) actively for the first 48
hours after discharge
•
‘settle in’ support is provided where needed
• Train discharge staff (potentially those who no longer have to undertake CHC
assessments) to operate ‘Trusted assessments’ for patients in hospital from
care homes, so they can return to their care home promptly, and support all
care homes with these new discharge arrangements.
3.3 Hospital clinical and managerial leadership team:
• Create safe and comfortable discharge spaces for patients to be transferred
to within one hour of decision to discharge, ensuring enough space for
increased numbers of discharges.
• Maintain timely and high quality transfer of information to General Practice
and other relevant health and care professional on all patients discharged.
To create a safety-net and increase confidence in discharging,
consider:
✓ Patient initiated follow up - give patients the direct number of the
ward discharged from to call back for advice.
Do not suggest
going back to their GP or coming to A&E.
✓ Telephone the following day after discharge to check and offer
reassurance/advice.
✓ Call them back with results of investigations and any changes or
updates to a patient’s management plan
✓ Bring them back under the same team / speciality.
✓ Request community nursing follow up with a specific clinical need
✓ Request GPs to follow up in some selected cases
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
10
• Use change 9 within the High Impact Change Model (see section 12) to
ensure planning and discharge for people with no home to go to and that no-
one is discharged to the street. See Annex E for further details on
homelessness.
• Senior clinical staff to be available to support ward and discharge staff with
appropriate risk-taking and clinical advice arrangements
• Where applicable to the patient, COVID-19 test results are included in
documentation that accompanies the person on discharge
• Ensure all patients identified being in the last days or weeks of their life are
rapidly transferred to the care of community palliative care teams who will be
responsible for co-ordinating and facilitating rapid discharge to home or a
hospice.

4. What are the actions for providers
of community health services?
4.1 Providers of community healthcare are expected to update their processes and ways
of working to deliver the discharge to assess model. Community health services will
take overall responsibility for ensuring the effective delivery of the discharge service
and for pathways 1,2 and 3.
As part of this they should:
• Identify an Executive Lead to oversee the implementation and delivery of the
Discharge to Assess model in the acute hospitals in their area. The model should
operate at least 8am-8pm 7 days a week
• Release staff from their current roles (see separate Community Health Service
prioritisation guidance) to co-ordinate and manage the discharge arrangements for
all patients from community and acute bedded units on pathways 1, 2 and 3
• Have an easily accessible single point of contact which will always accept
assessments from staff in the hospital and source the care requested, in
conjunction with local authorities
• Deliver enhanced occupational therapy and physiotherapy 7 days a week to
reduce the length of time a patient needs to remain in a hospital rehabilitation bed
• Use multi-disciplinary teams on the day they are home from hospital, to assess
and arrange packages of support for patients on pathways 2 and 3.
• Co-ordinate the care for patients discharged on pathways 1-3
• Ensure provision of equipment to support discharge.
• Ensure patients on all three pathways are tracked and followed up to assess for
long term needs at the end of the period of recovery
• Maintain the flow of patients from community beds including re-ablement and
rehabilitation packages in home settings, to allow the next sets of patients to be
discharged from acute care
4.2 For patients identified being in the last days or weeks of their life Community
Palliative Care teams will be responsible for co-ordinating and facilitating rapid
discharge to home or hospice. This supersedes the current fast track end of life
process
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
12
5. What are the actions for Councils
and Adult Social Care services?
5.1 As part of implementing the discharge to assess model, local authorities are asked to:
• Agree a single lead local authority or point of contact arrangement for each
hospital or Trust, ensuring each acute trust and single local coordinator for local
discharge to assess pathways has a single point to approach when coordinating
the discharge of all patients, regardless of where that person lives
• Work together and pool staffing to ensure the best use of resources and
prioritisation in relation to patients being discharged, respecting appropriate local
commissioning routes.
During this period, funding will be made available for all
patients being discharged and local authorities are enabled by the Care Act
(Section 19) to meet urgent needs where they have not completed an assessment
and regardless of the person’s ordinary residence
• Coordinate work with local and national voluntary sector organisations to provide
services and support to people requiring support around discharge from hospital
and subsequent recovery
• Take the lead contracting responsibilities for expanding the capacity in domiciliary
care, care homes and reablement services in the local area paid for from the NHS
COVID-19 budget.
5.2 Specific responsibilities for Adult Social Care
• Identify an Executive Lead for the leadership and delivery of the Discharge to
Assess model.
• Redeploy social work staff from the hospital setting to community settings to
support discharged patients. Safeguarding investigations should continue to take
place in a hospital setting if necessary.
• Ensure there are robust tracking mechanisms to track care placements so that
care users do not get lost in the system at a time of very rapid response.
• Suspend need for funding panels for hospital discharge during the level 4 incident,
with additional funding available to Local Authorities to cover any increased costs
during this period.
• Provide social care capacity to work alongside local community health services to
provide a single point of contact for hospital staff.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
13
• Support real time communication between the hospital and the single point of
contact, not just by email.
• Provide capacity to review care provision and change if necessary, at an
appropriate point.
• Work closely with community health providers over the provision of equipment.
• Ensure there is 7 day working for community social care teams (to be
commissioned by local authorities).
• Deploy adult social care staff flexibly in order to avoid an immediate bottlenecks in
arranging step down care and support in the community and at the same time
focusing on maintaining and building capacity in local systems
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
14
6. What are the actions for Clinical
Commissioning Groups?
6.1 CCGs supported by Integrated Care Systems (ICSs) or System Transformation
Partnerships (STPs) need to support the coordination of activities set out in this
framework. Specifically, they must:
• Coordinate local financial flows for NHS COVID-19 spend, including monitoring all
local spend, coordinating local funding arrangements and work in partnership with
local Government to support them in their lead contracting role in the local system.
• Comply with NHS England and NHS Improvement financial controls and reporting
as set out in Section 10.
• CCGs should follow the guidance on NHS Continuing Healthcare in line with the
detail found in Annex G.
• Free up staff resource from NHS Continuing Healthcare assessment processes to
support the discharge-to-assess activities and transfer staff to local providers to
support these new discharge arrangements.
• Arrange for community health end of life teams to take responsibility for any “fast
track patients” end of life care patients needing support and step down.
• Co-ordinate and lead the rapid implementation of the Capacity Tracker (see Annex
F) and NHS mail in care homes and hospices throughout their local area (see
Section 8.3).
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
15
7. What are the actions for the
Voluntary Sector?
Many systems already work with the voluntary sector to facilitate swift and safe
discharges. In the current situation immediate
consideration should be given to
increasing the capacity of these services
7.1 The sector should:
• mobilise quickly and focuses on safety and positive experiences for patients on the
discharge process,
enabling patients to feel supported at home. They can also
help reticent patients feel much more comfortable about being discharged
• Provide a range of practical support to facilitate rapid discharge, including
transport home and equipment such as key safes
• Support discharged patients with home settling services to maintain wellbeing in
the community (e.g. safety checks and essential food shopping)
• Provide ongoing community-based support to support emotional wellbeing, such
as wellbeing daily phone calls and companionship
• Engage with NHS providers (particularly discharge teams) to provide solutions to
operational discharge challenges, freeing-up clinical staff for other activities –
focusing on the patients on pathway 0
• Utilise embedded local voluntary organisations in discharge pathways and
enhance with input from large voluntary organisations
• Coordinate support between voluntary organisations and existing volunteers within
NHS providers.
• In advance of discharge be at the patient's home to accept equipment
• St John Ambulance can also provide assisted discharge where conveyance
by ambulance is required
7.2 Voluntary sector assisted discharge scheme extension
• Over the winter months of 2019/20, the British Red Cross Age UK and St
John Ambulance have been providing discharge support to 42 hospitals
between them. The charities provide practical and emotional support for both
inpatients and those attending A&E, then assist frail and vulnerable people
home from hospital. This service can remove practical barriers to discharge
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
16
by freeing up the time of NHS staff to focus on clinical tasks, providing
transport or escort home to resettle, and undertaking follow up safe-and-well
checks once home.
This service will now be extended to support up to 100
hospitals
7.3 NHS volunteers to support hospital discharge
In addition to the support being offered by charities as part of the response to
COVID-19, hospitals should consider how to deploy their NHS volunteers to
volunteering roles that can most reduce pressure on services.
Many hospitals
utilise volunteers to assist people in getting ready to go home from hospital,
ensuring they have everything they need and that everything is in place at
their place of residence. They can greatly speed up the discharge process
and also reduce the likelihood of readmission by ensuring that the person has
the right support and resources in place at home. Volunteers can also provide
advice and signposting to community support services and increase patient’s
confidence about leaving hospital and going home.
• 7.4 NHS England and Improvement is setting up a new scheme to identify
additional volunteers able to support the NHS led by the Royal Voluntary
Service using the GoodSAM app as the digital platform.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
17
8. What are the actions for Care
Providers?
8.1 Care Home providers:
• Maintain capacity and identify vacancies that can be used for hospital discharge
purposes
• Adopt from Monday 23rd March 2020 and implement the Capacity Tracker during
the COVID-19 outbreak to make vacancy information available to NHS and social
care colleagues in real time
• Providers of Care Homes, in partnership with their local Primary care Networks and
Community Health Provider, should consider how best to support residents, and
where already in place, embed the Enhanced Health in Care Home Framework in
line with timescales already outlined by NHSEI which have been communicated to
primary care providers.
This will ensure their residents are better supported (7 days
a week) by the NHS.
• Implement NHSmail in their care home from Monday 23rd March, to ease
communication between NHS and social care colleagues. From Monday 23rd
March 2020, faster NHSmail roll-out will be available to all care providers, to
support safe and secure transfer of information. NHSmail is accredited for sharing
patient identifiable and sensitive information, meaning it meets a set of information
security controls that offer an appropriate level of protection against loss or
inappropriate access.
To improve communication between health and social care during the COVID-19
outbreak, NHSX is speeding-up the roll-out of NHSmail and temporarily waiving the
completion of Data Security Protection Toolkit (DSPT) to allow for quicker on
boarding. This is in-line with information governance guidance for COVID-19.
These are temporary measures to improve communication during COVID-19. NHSX
is committed to enabling care providers to choose the right communication solutions
for them. Providers will be asked to give their own assurance that they are secure
and post-COVID-19, afterward NHSmail regional teams will take providers through
the full DSPT process, supporting them to accredit their secure email system or
NHSmail for sharing in future.
• Where ‘Trusted assessor relationships and arrangements are not in place with
Acute providers, rapidly work with the discharge team to implement these rules and
processes
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
18
8.2 Domiciliary care providers:
• Identify extra capacity to adult social care contract leads, that can be used for
hospital discharge purposes or follow on care from reablement services.
8.3 Patient Transport:
Patient Transport Services (PTS) are a critical resource in moving non-emergency patients
from one care setting to a more appropriate setting on another site. Demand for PTS will
increase through this period, and services will need to be more responsive.
• All PTS providers, across the NHS, independent and voluntary sector, will be
expected to provide support to enable the transfer of patients as part of the
discharge process and to support transfers and discharge as a priority in order to
maintain flow and maximise patient safety.
• Additional guidance on how PTS will be enabled to deliver through this incident,
including adjustments to KPI monitoring and reimbursement models will follow.
• Organisations should also consider alternative transport options. This could
include:
• Local Authority owned or contracted vehicles
• Volunteer cars
• Voluntary sector resources
• Taxi services
• Use of patient / relatives’ own car.
8.4 Equipment and assistive technology
The single coordinator will need to ensure there is access to sufficient equipment to
support discharge of people with reablement or rehabilitation needs at home.
As part of this, the local commissioner for NHS and Social Care Equipment must ensure:
• Local equipment services (across the NHS and local government) have a
sufficiency of supply of the more common items of equipment used to support
people with reablement or rehabilitation or longer-term care needs
• Access to such equipment can be quickly (same day where needed) and easily
facilitated seven days a week (utilising mutual aid with neighbouring areas or
redeployment of community based staff if required). This may include the
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
19
purchase of additional equipment and the recycling, cleaning and reuse of
equipment
• Providers are prepared for rapid implication of increased volumes of rehabilitation
equipment, including same day delivery requests
• The availability of equipment that can be used to reduce the need for two carers to
provide care to individuals, releasing workforce capacity
• Providers have access to adequate stocks of Personal Protective Equipment
(PPE).
• Simple approval process for more complex patients requiring hospital beds,
pressure relieving equipment and hoists. This should be through discussion and
verbal approval to order. Current senior clinician approval process and equipment
prescription matrices will be stood down
• Regular review and tracking of issued equipment to reduce over prescription of
equipment. The responsibility for review of equipment once a patient is discharged
will sit with the receiving care organisation
• Photographs supplied by family/carers/community staff including District Nurses as
an alternative to completing access and risk assessment visits for more complex
patients. If a visit is required, this will need to be arranged within 4 hours of
decision to discharge
• Discharge tracking information is used to ensure regular restocking of
buffer/satellite stores to maintain supply
• There is a comprehensive range of assistive technology items that can support
people to live safely and independently at home with next day access to support if
required. This goes significantly beyond falls pendants.
• Stock includes gas, carbon monoxide, smoke alarms including devices that
supports people who are blind and/or deaf, and temperature detectors. Movement
detectors, bed/chair occupancy detectors and flood detectors.
• There are enuresis sensors, epilepsy sensors and medication dispensers covering
a 28-day period.
• Equipment can be made available at low-cost and can be simple to fit without
hardwiring..
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement

9. Monitoring and increasing
rehabilitation capacity
9.1 After the first phase of discharging existing patients who do not meet the criteria for
being in an acute hospital, it will be essential to maintain this approach in any
rehabilitation and step down facilitates and broader care-at- home services. This will
avoid creating blockages in the community facilities/services and stop the next sets of
patients being discharged from acute care.
9.2 Pathways 1, 2 and 3:
• Of those patients discharged to short-term reablement/rehabilitation pathways
approximately 35% are likely to require long term care at home or placement in a
24-hour residential or nursing setting.
• It is essential that people on these pathways are tracked and assessed after a
period of recovery. Longer-term care or placement must be made available at the
right time to ensure that the pathways are not blocked for future patients needing
discharge from hospital.
9.3 Community Hospitals
It is vital that discharges from community hospitals are increased and delays
eradicated with the same approach and action taken in acute settings.
This
includes:
• A daily clinical review of the plan for every patient focusing on three questions
• Why not home?
• What needs to be different to make this possible at home?
• Why not today?
• The review process should explore why people require rehabilitation in a bedded
setting. It is accepted that the majority patients will be medically stable in this
setting.
• All patients should have an expected date of discharge (EDD) and be fully
involved with their discharge planning. Essential that expectations are set at the
point of transfer or admission
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
21
• The review should specifically look at whether people can be supported at home.
The default assumption will be discharge home today
• All actions from the review should be noted and aimed to be completed by the end
of the day.
9.4 Short-term placement for people who require 24-hour supervision and care
• For people who need a 24-hour care setting it is essential they are assigned a
case manager (social worker, discharge team nurse or CHC nurse) who will
review them regularly using the same questions as for community hospitals.
• Discharge should be arranged as soon as possible to their own home and
packages of support made available.
9.5 Short term rehabilitation/reablement-at-home review
• Using a professional supervision/case management model the service must
review all people on their caseloads daily. The team identifies all patients who
have been on caseloads for an extended period.
• These patients are discussed using the following questions:
o What is our current aim of support?
o Have we met this? If not, what is going to change to enable us to meet
this aim?
o Are we best placed to support this need? Is there an alternative?
o Can we safely discharge this person?
• Actions from the discussion are recorded and actions followed up daily.

10. Finance support and funding flows
10.1 The Government has agreed to fully fund the cost of new or extended out-of-
hospital health and social care support packages, referred to in this guidance, for
people being discharged from hospital or would otherwise be admitted into it for a
limited time, to enable quick and safe discharge and more generally reduce pressure
on acute services. There will be separate announcements on local government
resilience funding for social care.
10.2 This section sets out the financial support available for this care and support
capacity and enhanced discharge support services from NHS England and
Improvement; how finance support will to flow to CCGs; and how the relevant
commissioning budgets should be managed locally.
10.3 There will be a suspension of usual patient funding eligibility criteria while this
process in in place. NHSE&I will ensure there is sufficient funding to support CCGs
and their local authority partners to commission the enhanced discharge support
outlined in this guidance. CCGs are expected to ensure that an appropriate market-
rate is paid for this support. This includes liaising with their local authorities to agree an
approach to ensuring the market can sustain a rapid and significant increase in supply.
This appropriate market-rate may need to reflect that some patients and the capacity
being utilised would previously have been self-funded.
10.4 This NHSE&I funding support will commence from 19th March and will reimburse,
via CCGs, the costs of out-of-hospital care and support that arise as a result of the
approach outlined in this document (both new packages and enhancements to existing
packages), where it is provided to patients on or later than this date. Any patients
already receiving out of hospital care and support that started before this date will be
expected to be funded through usual pre-existing mechanisms and sources of funding.
10.5 This funding agreement will be kept under review. CCGs and local authority
partners will be notified by NHSE&I or DHSC when this no longer applies to new
patients.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
23
Proposed finance route from CCGs for additional
discharge support services
10.6 In order to expedite the most appropriate flow of funds and minimise administrative
burden, the following process should be followed.
10.7 Procurement and contracting rules continue to apply. Local commissioners should
agree the most appropriate route to deliver the enhanced discharge support in their
area. Additional financial support provided to CCGs and local authorities should be
pooled locally using existing statutory mechanisms. Under section 75 of the NHS Act
2006, CCGs and local authorities can enter into partnership agreements that allow for
local government to perform health related functions where this will likely lead to an
improvement in the way these functions are discharged.
10.8 Where systems decide that an enhanced supply of out of hospital care and support
services will be commissioned via the local authority, the existing section 75
agreements can be extended or amended to include these services and functions and
the local authority should commission the health and social care activity on behalf of
the system. Similarly, where a CCG is already acting as a lead commissioner for
integrated health and care, partners can agree that existing section 75 arrangements
can be varied to allow them to commission social care services.
10.9 Where CCGs and local government agree, BCF section 75 agreements can be
extended or varied for this purpose[1]. A model template for a variation to a section 75
agreement is available on the NHS England website[2].
10.10 The funding provided should be separately identified within the agreement and
monitored to ensure funding flows correctly. It should be pooled alongside existing
local authority planned expenditure on discharge support. Support provided and
agreed budgets from this funding should be recorded at individual level. Where care is
[1] The Better Care Fund Policy allocations for the CCG minimum contribution and the improved Better Care Fund have
been made public.
Although BCF plans from April 2020 will not have been formally approved, for the duration of the current outbreak of
COVID-19, systems should assume that spending from ringfenced BCF funds, particularly on existing schemes from
2019-20 and spending on activity to address demands in community health and social care, is approved and should
prioritise continuity of care, maintaining social care services and system resilience.

COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
24
most appropriately commissioned directly by NHS commissioners, this should be
placed under existing contractual arrangements with providers but invoiced separately
to ensure that enhanced discharge support funding is identifiable. This care should be
paid for from the additional funding set out in this section.
10.11 Where a patient has been admitted to secondary care and had previously been in
receipt of a funded care package (either in a care-home or in their own home) this
guidance and additional funding is intended to support the restart of such a package
also. I.e. restarted care following discharge will be counted as covered by this
additional funding.
10.12 CCGs and local authorities should work with the trusts from which patients are
being discharged, and with their community services and voluntary sector partners, to
ensure that the most appropriate enhanced discharge services are being provided and
that these align with the needs of patients that the trusts are seeing.
10.13 Commissioners should work with providers of discharge services to ensure that
extending existing contracts will be financially sustainable for those providers, and
consider mitigating actions where there is a risk that they will not be.
Reimbursement routes and cashflow
10.14 CCGs should ensure that both they and any local authorities commissioning on
their behalf reimburse their providers in a timely fashion, reflecting differing cash-flow
requirements of those providers – paying particular consideration to smaller providers.
Local authority and CCG commissioners should refer to guidance published by the
Local Government Association, ADASS and the Care Provider Alliance on social care
provider resilience during COVID-19.
10.15 NHSE&I expect ordinary financial controls to be maintained with respect to
invoicing, raising of purchase orders and authorising payments. However, CCGs
should ensure that there is not an undue administrative burden that slows down the
commencement of the enhanced discharge support services. Where necessary,
retrospective approvals and approaches to the degree of detailed financial scrutiny
appropriate to achieving this aim should be undertaken.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
25
10.16 NHSE&I will reimburse CCGs through the monthly allocation process. CCGs
should, from the commencement date, maintain a record of the costs and activity
associated with the enhanced discharge process so that they can submit a claim for
additional payment for this from NHSE&I using a centralised approach that will be
separately communicated.
10.17 Whichever model is followed CCGs should record the costs associated with this
and link in with other wider COVID-19 financial reporting requirements. CCGs should
expect to be asked for monthly updates on the costs of these services.
Enhanced discharge support – cessation process
10.18 Commissioners should plan throughout the period that the enhanced discharge
support process is running to ensure appropriate processes are in place for the period
following cessation of the enhanced discharge support process. As part of this,
planning conversations should be taking place with patients and their families about
the possibility that they will need to pay for their care later, as appropriate.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
26
11. Reporting and performance
management
11.1 Current performance standards on DTOC monthly reported delays will be
suspended from 19 March 2020.
11.2 Trusts should continue to report DTOC figures through the usual process, but will
not be performance managed on them during the period of the incident.
11.3 Providers of community rehabilitation beds must start reporting DTOC figures on a
daily basis to NHS Digital from Monday 23rd March.
11.4 NHS providers will be required to report the following during the Incident:
(1) Bed occupancy in hospitals – via daily sitrep
(2) Number of patients on daily discharge list
(3) Number and percentage of patients successfully discharged from discharge list
(4) Bed availability in community settings, via the Capacity Tracker Tool
11.5 Clinical Commissioning Groups will be required to submit the monthly financial
spend to NHS England for reimbursement.

12. Additional resources and support
Webinars
12.1 To support implementation, NHS England will be running webinars to run through
the guidance and provide local areas with the opportunity to ask questions.
This will
be supported by Frequently Asked Questions which will be regularly updated.
12.2 The webinars are for all those involved in discharge, at all levels and from all
organisations
-CCGs, local government, health and care providers, housing, voluntary
and community sector and social care providers.
The webinars will be the same
content run over four different sessions during the weeks commencing 16 March and
23 March 2020.
12.3 To register for the webinars, the web link is:

Annex A: The Discharge to Assess Model
This model, based on best practice, assumes that:
95% of people can go straight home on discharge:
• 50% can go home with minimal or no additional support (Pathway 0)
• 45% can go home with a short or longer-term support care package
(Pathway 1)
5% of people will require residential or nursing care setting:
• 4% require rehabilitation support (Pathway 2)
• 1% require nursing home care (Pathway 3).
Figure 1: Discharge to Assess model
There are three stages to the discharge to assess model:
Stage one
Review patients
daily and identify
patients for
discharge to leave
that day
✓ Clinically-led review of all patients at an early morning
board round, any patient meeting the revised clinical
criteria will be deemed suitable for discharge
✓ At least twice daily review of all patients in acute beds to
agree who is not required to be in hospital, and will
therefore be discharged:
✓ All patients who are not required to be in hospital and are
therefore suitable for discharge will be added to the
discharge list and allocated to a discharge pathway.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
30
✓ Discharge home should be the default pathway
✓ The discharge list will be managed by the community
provider with the lead responsibility for ensuring the
Discharge Service Requirements are met – this provider
will be the single coordinator
Stage two
The details of how
to discharge
patients
✓ On decision of discharge, the patient and their family or
carer, and any formal supported housing workers should
be informed and receive the relevant leaflet (see Annex K)
✓ Community health, social care and acute staff need to
work in full synchronisation (and include housing
professionals where necessary) to ensure patients are
discharged on time.
✓ The delineation of responsibility to coordinate and manage
the discharge arrangements are expected to be:
o Pathway 0 – acute discharge staff lead
o Pathways 1, 2 and 3 – community health staff lead
✓ On decision of discharge, all patients will be allocated a
case manager by the single coordinator
✓ All patients must be transferred to an allocated discharge
area/lounge within one hour of decision to discharge
✓ The case manager will be responsible for ensuring:
o Individuals and their families are fully informed of
the next steps
o Patient transport home is available, where needed
o ‘Settle in’ support is provided where needed
✓ Senior clinical staff should be available to support staff with
positive risk-taking and clinical advice
✓ Where applicable to the patient, COVID-19 test results are
included in documentation that accompanies the person on
discharge
Stage three
Assessment and
care planning at
home
✓ Post discharge, the single coordinator will need to
ensure the staff and infrastructure is available to
provide immediate care needs, review and assess for
longer-term care packages or end support where it is
no longer needed.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
31
✓ The single coordinator should draw on all available
local resources, including the voluntary and community
sector and social care staff no longer undertaking
assessment work in the acute units.
➢ Coordinated home assessments between health and
social care, including equipment and reablement
support, take place ideally on the same day of
discharge, led by a trusted assessor
Important considerations for all pathways:
• Duties under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 still apply during this period. If a person
is suspected to lack the relevant mental capacity to make the decisions about their
ongoing care and treatment, a capacity assessment should be carried out before
decision about their discharge is made. Where the person is assessed to lack the
relevant mental capacity and a decision needs to be made then there must be a
best interest decision made for their ongoing care in line with the usual processes. If
the proposed arrangements amount to a deprivation of liberty, Deprivation of Liberty
Safeguards in care homes arrangements and orders from the Court of Protection
for community arrangements still apply but should not delay discharge.
• For patients identified being in the last days or weeks of their life Hospital or
Community Palliative Care teams will be responsible for co-ordinating and
facilitating rapid discharge to home or Hospice. This supersedes the current fast
track end of life process.

Annex B: Maintaining good decision making in acute
settings
Every patient on every general ward should be reviewed on a twice daily board round to
determine the following. If the answer to each question is ‘no’, active consideration for
discharge to a less acute setting must be made.
Requiring ITU or HDU care
Requiring oxygen therapy/ NIV
Requiring intravenous fluids
NEWS2 > 3
(clinical judgement required in patients with AF &/or chronic respiratory disease)
Diminished level of consciousness where recovery realistic
Acute functional impairment
in excess of home/community care provision
Last hours of life
Requiring intravenous medication > b.d. (including analgesia)
Undergone lower limb surgery within 48hrs
Undergone thorax-abdominal/pelvic surgery with 72 hrs
Within 24hrs of an invasive procedure
(with attendant risk of acute life threatening deterioration)
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
33
Clinical exceptions will occur but must be warranted and justified. Recording the rationale
will assist meaningful, time efficient review.
Review/challenge questions for the clinical team:
• Is the patient medically optimised? – (Don’t use ‘medically fit’ or ‘back to
baseline’).
• What management can be continued as ambulatory - e.g. heart failure treatment?
• What management can be continued outside the hospital with community / district
nurses? e.g.
IV antibiotics?
• Patients with low NEWS (0-4) scores – can they be discharged with suitable follow
up?
• If not scoring 3 on any one parameter e.g. – pulse rate greater than 130
• If their oxygen needs can be met at home.
• Stable and not needing frequent observations every 4 hours or less
• Not needing any medical / nursing care after 8pm.
• Patients waiting for results – can they come back, or can they be phoned
through?
• Repeat bloods – can they done after discharge in an alternative setting?
• Patients waiting for investigations – can they go home and come back as
out patients with the same waiting as inpatients?
Criteria- ed discharge:
• Can a nurse or allied health care professional discharge without a further review if
criteria are well written out?
• Can a junior doctor discharge without a further review if criteria are clearly
documented?
• How can we contact the consultant directly if criteria are only slightly out of range
and require clarification?

Annex C: COVID-19 Trusted Assessor guidance
12.9 This guidance is an interim supplement to CQC’s Guidance on Trusted Assessor
Agreements. It has been written to support NHS and social care providers and Trusted
Assessor schemes during the COVID-19 pandemic. It will apply until further notice.
12.10 This update seeks to further remove and reduce delays in decision-making
processes that can stop patients who are ready to be discharged from leaving NHS
acute or community beds. Shifting to this revised approach will require hospital staff,
providers and other partners to work in new and different ways.
12.11 The Government is bringing forth legislation to allow CCGs to delay assessments
for CHC until after the conclusion of the coming period, including for individuals being
discharged from hospital. This means the priority can be on timely discharges, with
eligibility assessments and funding decisions taking place afterwards.
12.12 ‘Trusted Assessor’ schemes are a national initiative designed to reduce delays
when people are ready for discharge from hospital. Providers adopt assessments
carried out by suitably qualified ‘Trusted Assessors’ working under formal, written
agreements.
12.13 Assessments and care planning can be undertaken by Trusted Assessor schemes
in a way that meets both people’s needs and legal requirements on providers.
12.14 Providers accepting trusted assessments must have access to a process by which
they can escalate concerns when a person has been discharged to their service with
needs they are unable to meet. The process must be able to respond to those
concerns promptly. Where a concern is raised about the appropriateness of the
placement, CQC will expect this to be considered promptly.
12.15 Key changes from existing arrangements:
(1) All hospitals will train additional discharge staff to operate as ‘Trusted assessors’.
Trusted Assessors will continue to support care providers with discharge
arrangements. The additional staff will supplement Trusted Assessors in existing
schemes.
(2) Most hospitals already use trusted assessor schemes for discharges to care
homes and care at home services in their areas. These should be kept up to date
in local NHS Discharge to Assess (D2A) arrangements. This should be prioritised.
(3) Over this period CQC’s priority is to continue to check that people are safe. Where
we have serious concerns, we will use inspection and other processes to do so.

(4) Registered providers and managers will need to have confidence that legal
requirements for assessments will be met, and that particular consideration will be
given to safety and infection control-related needs during this heightened period.

36
Annex D: Patient discharge choice leaflet
It is recognised that issues of patient choice and engagement can often be significant
barriers to hospital discharge where there are ongoing social care needs after discharge
(particularly if moving to a residential or nursing home). During the COVID-19 response
there will be suspension of choice protocols for this particular issue. The following leaflets
have been produced to support the communication of this message.
Leaflet A – to be shared and explained to all patients on admission to hospital
Leaflet B – to be shared and explained to all patients prior to discharge, this is split into
leaflets:
• Leaflet B1 for patients who are being discharged to their usual place of
residence
• Leaflet B2 for patients moving on to further non-acute bedded care
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
37
Annex E: Homelessness
o The requirements of the homeless and people living on the streets, also need to be
reflected in any local framework to support the Government’s COVID-19 emergency.
o Practices that have been developed in systems to support homeless persons need to
be maintained and enhanced to reflect the need to support the needs of those who are
without a home and living on the street.
It is already known that this group has a high
level of mortality, and support needs including mental ill-health and substance misuse
which may present a barrier to self-isolation.
o NHS trusts have a statutory duty under the Homelessness Reduction Act (2017) to refer
people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness to a local housing authority. This
statutory duty remains.
o To prevent homelessness from delaying discharge, the following should be followed:
• Referrals should be made at the earliest opportunity as soon as it has been
identified that a person may be homeless on discharge as this provides more
time for the housing authority and other support services to respond. The person
must give consent and can choose which authority to be referred to.
• People who are homeless also need to be able to safely self-isolate to also
prevent the need for greater care and reduce transmission risks.
• Systems should be vigilant in spotting symptoms – using organisations and staff
to spot potential COVID-19 positive persons who are homeless and have access
to rapid triage to cohort people accordingly.
• Local systems need to plan and provide for multiple venues to cohort and care
for homeless people who are COVID-19 positive, thereby still managing people in
the community where there needs to be spaces to keep people separate with
provision on the street; accommodation, water, food, sanitation.

Annex F: Community rehabilitation & hospice bed
capacity – Capacity Tracker
As part of current discharge planning there is an imperative to understand bed occupancy
and vacancies in the community. The Capacity Tracker produced and operated by NHS
North of England Commissioning Support (NECS) is to be used by all systems nationally
to record their care home, community and hospice bed capacity.
The Capacity Tracker is an established web-based tool providing the opportunity to
easily track bed capacity and vacancies to support system wide bed and discharge
planning. It has been successfully operating to support care home bed planning for
some time.
To support current discharge planning Capacity Tracker will maintain support to
organisations already registered, but will be expanded to capture bed capacity data in
all care homes, all hospices (including children’s hospices) and from all providers of
inpatient community rehabilitation and end of life care.
This is not intended to replace current information systems already being used in
some localities to track bed / room vacancies, but to run in parallel
All the above providers are required to use Capacity Tracker to report the following
vacancies and broader status information (in care homes only at this stage) to ensure
consistency of approach and availability of a real-time single source of truth across
England.
Data being collected will be:
i. Number of beds
ii. Number of bed vacancies
iii. Current status i.e. Open / Closed to Admissions (care homes only), including
number of COVID-19 residents
iv. Workforce / staffing levels (care homes only)
This essential information will be included in daily national SitRep reporting to
support capacity planning and response. It should also be used by localities to
understand their bed base and support system wide discharge planning. To support
reliable real time discharge planning when using Capacity Tracker it must be
updated as close to real time as practicable – e.g. as and when any occupancy
changes or at least once per day if there has been no change.
Accurate and timely data is essential for effective management of the response to
the COVID pandemic bot locally and nationally
System activities/requirements
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
39
There needs to be rapid system wide adoption of the Capacity Tracker. It will go live on
23rd March, with comprehensive support for registration and operation being developed.
The full support offer to enable organisations will include a call centre, online tools, and
webinars to enable users to understand what they need to input and how.
All care homes, all hospices (including children’s hospices) and all providers of
inpatient community rehabilitation and end of life care are required to be fully using
Capacity Tracker by 1st April 2020.
For current support please visit Capacity Tracker website address at:
https://carehomes.necsu.nhs.uk/.
This weblink will signpost to wider resources when they
are available to be released.
Prior to Capacity Tracker going live and to make this happen in the required timescale,
CCGs must take the responsibility to each nominate a group of System Champions (more
than one person is required to cover in the case of absence) who will oversee the rapid
implementation of Capacity Tracker in their locality. Their name(s) and email address must
be notified to NHS NECS via necsu.capacitytracker@nhs.net as soon as practicable.

Annex G: NHS Continuing Healthcare and COVID-19
Planning
NHS Continuing Healthcare as referred to throughout this document relates to individuals
aged 18 or over.
NHS Continuing Healthcare COVID-19 emergency
preparedness
Temporary Arrangements
Temporary arrangements for NHS Continuing Healthcare (NHS CHC) need to be
implemented for the duration of the COVID-19 emergency period. These arrangements
cover:
• The assessment of eligibility for NHS CHC funding;
• Individual requests for a review of an eligibility decision (i.e. Local Resolution and
Independent Review); and,
• Three- and twelve-month reviews of NHS CHC packages of care
Objectives
The objectives of implementing any temporary arrangements for NHS CHC are:
• to expedite safe discharge of patients from acute hospital beds under EPPR
arrangements.
• to reduce the NHS CHC assessment burden in and out of hospital settings; and
• to release clinical and support staff to support the system to manage the COVID-19
outbreak.
Emergency Measures to be implemented for NHS CHC during the
COVID-19 Emergency Period
• The current legislation does not describe a specific timeframe for carrying out NHS
CHC assessments of eligibility, or for individual requests for a review of an
eligibility decision (i.e. Local Resolution and Independent Review). Therefore, NHS
CHC assessments for individuals on the acute hospital discharge pathway and in
community settings will not be required until the end of the COVID-19 emergency
period. Planned legislative change, as part of the COVID-19 Bill, will further
support the NHS in relation to this.
• Individuals can still make requests for a review of an eligibility decision (i.e. Local
Resolution and Independent Review) however the time frame for a response will
be relaxed.
COVID-19 Hospital Discharge Service Requirement
41
• There is an expectation that CCGs will take a proportionate view to undertaking
three- and twelve-month reviews to ensure that the individual’s care package is
meeting their needs and to ensure that any concerns raised are addressed as
appropriate.
• Commissioning end of life services remains important therefore, and the Fast
Track pathway tool can still be used for clinical assessments or other local tools as
appropriate. However, to remove decision making delays, the responsibility to co-
ordinate the arrangements for care at home or a hospice bed should be passed to
local Community palliative care teams during this period.
• During the COVID-19 emergency period, CCGs will not be held to account on the
NHS CHC Assurance Standards nor timeframes for dealing with NHS CHC
individual requests for reviews of eligibility decisions.
• These measures set out for NHS CHC are only in place for the duration of the
COVID-19 emergency period.
• Local systems need to ensure that they have some method of monitoring actions
taken during the COVID-19 emergency measures, for example using the NHS
CHC Checklist, so that individuals are assessed correctly once business as usual
resumes.
Implications for Adopting the COVID-19 Emergency Measures for
NHS Continuing Healthcare
• If NHS CHC full assessments of eligibility are deferred, a backlog of circa 5,000
assessments per month will be created which will have future workload
implications for CCGs, NHS and Local Authority staff. The same will apply to
individual requests for a review of an eligibility decisions (i.e. Local Resolution and
Independent Review). A handling plan will need to be developed to enable the
system to ‘normalise’ following the COVID-19 emergency period;
• There may be a financial impact upon CCGs funding under discharge to assess
arrangements as part of the hospital discharge pathway for longer periods than
usual and the COVID-19 emergency money can be used for this purpose.
• Where social care has been provided free at the point of delivery for the
emergency period, the expectations of individuals in receipt of funded care
packages that may not continue to be funded after the COVID-19 emergency
period, this will need to be managed, as some individuals will need to return to
usual funding arrangements, which will mean they may have to contribute or fully
fund their care.
• Although NHS CHC is effectively a “funding stream”, the clinicians involved in NHS
CHC assessment and review are required to assess the specific needs of highly
vulnerable individuals and to commission the relevant care.
Therefore, it is still
important to ensure that care packages are commissioned that meet the needs of
these individuals.

Number of cases
As of 9am on 21 March 2020, 72,818 people have been tested in the UK, of which 67,800 were confirmed negative and 5,018 were confirmed positive.
As of 9am, 233 patients in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) have died.
Cases identified in England
Confirmed cases in each local authority and NHS region are published by Public Health England (PHE).
Risk level
The risk to the UK has been raised to high.
Recent government action
The government published its coronavirus action plan on 3 March.
On 10 February, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, announced strengthened legal powers to protect public health.
The Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 have been put in place to reduce the risk of further human-to-human transmission in this country by keeping individuals in isolation where public health professionals believe there is a reasonable risk an individual may have the virus.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) action plan

Coronavirus action plan: a guide to what you can expect across the UK
PDF, 263KB, 28 pages
Details
This document sets out what the UK as a whole has done – and plans to do – to tackle the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, based on our experience dealing with other infectious diseases and our influenza pandemic preparedness work.
The exact response to coronavirus (COVID-19) will be tailored to the nature, scale and location of the threat in the UK, as our understanding of this develops.
The document sets out:
what we know about the virus and the disease it causes
how we have planned for an infectious disease outbreak such as the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak
the actions taken so far in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak
what we are planning to do next, depending on the course the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak takes
the role the public can play in supporting this response, now and in the future
The current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which began in December 2019, presents a significant challenge for the entire world. The UK government and devolved administrations, including the health and social care system, have planned extensively over the years for an event like this. The UK is therefore well prepared to respond in a way that offers substantial protection to the public.

Overview
Stay at home advice
Staying at home can help stop coronavirus spreading
You'll need to stay at home if you have symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) or live with someone who does.
Staying at home means you should:
not go to work, school or public areas
not use public transport or taxis
not have visitors, such as friends and family, in your home
not go out to buy food or collect medicine – order them by phone or online, or ask someone else to drop them off at your home
You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.
Information:
If you're not sure if you need to stay at home
If you have symptoms of coronavirus (a high temperature or a new, continuous cough), use the 111 coronavirus service to find out what to do.
How long to stay at home
If you have symptoms
If you have symptoms of coronavirus, you'll need to stay at home for 7 days.
After 7 days:
if you do not have a high temperature, you do not need to stay at home
if you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal
You do not need to stay at home if you just have a cough after 7 days. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.
If you live with someone who has symptoms
If you live with someone who has symptoms, you'll need to stay at home for 14 days from the day their symptoms started. This is because it can take 14 days for symptoms to appear.
If more than 1 person at home has symptoms, stay at home for 14 days from the day the first person started having symptoms.
If you get symptoms, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms start, even if it means you're at home for longer than 14 days.
If you do not get symptoms, you can stop staying at home after 14 days.
Get an isolation note to give to your employer
If you live with someone who has symptoms of coronavirus, you can get an isolation note to send to your employer as proof you need to stay off work.
You do not need to get a note from a GP.
Get an isolation note

If you have symptoms of coronavirus and need to stay at home, use the 111 coronavirus service to get an isolation note.
If you have symptoms and live with a vulnerable person
If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to arrange for them to stay with friends or family for 14 days.
If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.
Do
try to keep 2 metres (3 steps) away from each other
avoid using shared spaces, such as kitchens or bathrooms, at the same time as each other
open windows in shared spaces if you can
clean a shared bathroom each time you use it, for example by wiping the surfaces you have touched
use a dishwasher if you have one – if you do not have one, use washing-up liquid and warm water and dry everything thoroughly
Don't
do not share a bed, if possible
do not share towels, including hand towels and tea towels
Reducing the spread of infection in your home
While you're staying at home, you should:
wash your hands with soap and water often, for at least 20 seconds
use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available
cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze
put used tissues in the bin straight away and wash your hands afterwards
clean objects and surfaces you touch often (like door handles, kettles and phones) using your regular cleaning products
How to do your cleaning and laundry
Use your usual household products, such as detergents and bleach, when you clean your home.
Put used tissues and disposable cleaning cloths in rubbish bags. Then put the bag into a second bag and tie it securely. Wait 3 days before putting it in your outside bin.
Dispose of other household waste as normal.
Wash your laundry in the washing machine in the usual way. Laundry that has been in contact with an ill person can be washed with other people's items. Do not shake dirty laundry, as this may spread the virus in the air.
If you do not have a washing machine, wait for 3 days after your stay at home has ended before taking your laundry to a launderette.
Looking after your health and wellbeing
To help yourself stay well while you're at home:
drink plenty of water to stay hydrated – drink enough so your pee is pale and clear
take paracetamol to help ease your symptoms
stay in touch with family and friends over the phone or on social media, to help you avoid feeling low or lonely
try to keep yourself busy – you could try activities like cooking, reading, online learning and watching films
do light exercise, if you feel well enough to
There is advice about how to look after your mental wellbeing while staying at home from Every Mind Matters.
Ibuprofen
There is currently no strong evidence that ibuprofen can make coronavirus (COVID-19) worse.
But until we have more information, take paracetamol to treat the symptoms of coronavirus, unless your doctor has told you paracetamol is not suitable for you.
If you are already taking ibuprofen or another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) on the advice of a doctor, do not stop taking it without checking first.
What to do if you need medical help if you have to stay at home
If you get symptoms not related to coronavirus and need medical help:
do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital
if it's not an emergency, use the NHS 111 online service – call 111 if you cannot get help online
if it's an emergency, call 999 – tell the call handler you may have coronavirus
Cancel all routine face-to-face medical and dental appointments while you're staying at home. You may be able to do some appointments over the phone.
Urgent advice: Use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service if:
you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home
your condition gets worse
Use the 111 coronavirus service
Only call 111 if you cannot get help online.

COVID-19 Prioritisation within Community Health Services
Following on from Sir Simon Stevens’ and Amanda Pritchard’s letter of 17 March 2020, this letter
and annex set out how providers of community services can release capacity to support the COVID-
19 preparedness and response. These arrangements will apply until 31 July 2020 in the first in-
stance.
The current priorities for providers of community services during this pandemic are:
1. Support home discharge today of patients from acute and community beds, as mandated in
the new Hospital Discharge Service Requirements, and ensure patients cared for at home
receive urgent care when they need it
2. By default, use digital technology to provide advice and support to patients wherever possi-
ble
3. Prioritise support for high-risk individuals who will be advised to self-isolate for 12 weeks.
Further advice on this will be published shortly.
4. Apply the principle of mutual aid with health and social care partners, as decided through
your local resilience forum.
Thank you for your support and the important work you are undertaking.
Yours faithfully
