Health professionals are generating huge numbers of urgent questions. There is no possibility of addressing these using conventional approaches to EBM. Even a six-week rapid review is far too long here. Many of the current AI challenges (e.g. Kaggle/White House) are focusing on the primary literature.

On the ground people are desperate for information, but there is little organised dissemination of best evidence or best practice. Unattributed narratives and rules of thumb are being circulated online to fill this gap.
Much of this is anecdote. 

A number of groups are producing very rapid evidence-based guidelines. For example, [CEBM](https://www.cebm.net/oxford-covid-19/), [Trish Greenhalgh/BJGP](https://bjgplife.com/2020/03/18/video-consultations-guide-for-practice/).
