An emotional and psychological survival guide (Part 1)
We are all finding things difficult at the moment. We are not alone. We are all struggling with this. Even if it feels like
you aren’t, you probably are. We can’t make it go away but we would like to offer you some suggestions.
In this, the first of what we hope will be a series of articles, we offer some simple tips on how we can stay well and
support each other as clinicians. This material is developed from the Red Whale Mental Health course and, from the
linked podcast, by our LMT presenter and Shapes Toolkit founder, Dr Rachel Morris, with Dr Caroline Walker, NHS Psy-
chiatrist, expert in doctor wellbeing and founder of The Joyful Doctor.
What is going on?
At the moment, most of us are in the early phases of anxiety of related to ‘what is yet to come’.
We can use the CBT model below to understand why we are feeling as we are at the moment. You may find it is af-
fecting any (or all!) of your thoughts, behaviours, feelings or physical sensations.
Think for a moment of where you find yourself at the moment. Which area(s) are you struggling with most?
Fight and flight mode
This is not a drill. Our minds are in full ‘threat, threat, threat…’ mode and our amygdalae are going crazy. If you are
familiar with The Chimp Paradox, our poor little chimps are screaming in their cages. They need to be heard and we
need to soothe them because, for many of us, a big part of our job is listening to and helping soothe the ‘chimps’
(amygdalae!) of our patients – and, at times, our colleagues. So, it is critical now, more than ever, that we practice
self-care.

What might help?
Get the basics right
Simple things will make a difference, and they are the very things we are likely to STOP doing at this time, but we need to help
each other to make sure we are looking after ourselves. This means we need to:
• Take regular breaks and use them for rest.
• Refuel: drink, eat.
• Go to the loo when you need to.
• Be kind to yourself and each other – situations like this bring our best and worst days.
• Connect with people at work – have a couple of 5–10-minute get togethers each day. Prioritise making it happen. You are
not responsible for the whole of society. You can only do so much. (At Red Whale, we have set up a daily virtual coffee
break for 15 minutes each day; anyone who is free can bring a coffee and join.)
Control what you can control (your behaviours)
• Social media: reduce the amount overall. Notice how it makes you feel and find your own balance. There is good and bad
– it can be helpful to reach out, connect and find support, but it can also escalate things.
• News updates: set specific and time-framed periods to look at the news, e.g. 10 minutes twice daily. Consider using the
press conferences.
• As far as possible, try to keep your usual routine and participate in usual activities, even if you have to be a bit creative,
e.g. virtual coffee with a friend, watching a family film and chatting about it by WhatsApp as it takes place, doing a HIIT
workout in the garden or indoors.
• Think of life one day at a time. What can you do to stay in the moment? – use mindfulness techniques (https://www.head-
space.com).
• Reach out in our communities to make connections and ask for help if you need it.
Don’t try to stop and control worrying thoughts…it’s impossible
In this situation, worrying thoughts are normal and we can’t suppress them. But we can avoid going down the rabbit hole.
Strategies that might help include changing our relationship with those thoughts by noticing them and using strategies such as:
• Distraction (see below).
• Worry time (see below).
• Mindfulness.
• Sharing the thoughts to normalise them: talk to others about your thoughts and feelings. This in itself may help.
• Completing a gratitude journal where you identify 3 things each day that you are grateful for. Gratitude is a great antidote
for anxiety as it is (almost) impossible to feel both things at the same time.
• Challenging (re-framing) the thoughts, e.g. my mum is going to die, what if I get it and die, how will my kids cope, what will
my funeral be like... Look at the balance of evidence for the REAL rather than mind-created risk. then reframe it, e.g. the
story I’m telling myself is: I am going to die and my children will be left without a mother, and compare this with the reality:
It is unlikely I will die; I am relatively young and have no other health problems.
Microskill: distraction
Distraction is a useful short-term way of stopping ourselves getting overly caught up in negative thoughts or worries
about an unknown future. Use it when you are finding it difficult to stop thinking or worrying. It does not involve try-
ing to suppress negative thoughts, but instead helps you to actively focus your attention on a different activity.
Type of distraction activity Examples…
Exercise and activity Go for a walk or bike ride; put on the radio and dance; walk briskly up the stairs; stretch or
do yoga; go for a jog; do some vigorous cleaning.
Be creative Draw, paint or sculpt; write in your diary; sing; play a musical instrument; knit; sew; carry
out a DIY project.
Connect with others Phone or text a friend; help someone else; go to a public place; have a hug from someone
special; talk about your problems with someone you trust; call a helpline.
Soothing and calming Take a bath or shower; stroke a pet; have a warm drink; have a massage; listen to soothing
music; practice meditation, mindfulness or relaxation activities.
Constructive activities Send an important email; spend 10 minutes tidying or organising; cook or bake; garden;
write a 'to-do' list; volunteer your time.
Activities requiring concentra-
tion
Do a puzzle, crossword or sudoku; play solitaire, computer games or apps; watch a movie
or a funny video clip.
Self-care Paint your nails; apply some moisturiser; put on a nice outfit; write down something you
like about yourself and something you are grateful for.
Release Clench an ice-cube; sprint for 30 seconds on the spot; snap a band on your wrist; punch a
pillow or a punch-bag; listen to loud music.
Microskill: worry time
Worry time is a way of coping with excessive worrying. It involves learning to postpone worrying, or put it ‘on hold’
until a more convenient time. This will lead to worrying becoming less intrusive and will give us a greater sense of con-
trol.
The steps for using worry time are outlined below – it takes practise!
Steps for ‘worry time’
• Choose a worry time: plan a regular period of 15–30 minutes for worrying each day, ideally at the same time and in the
same place. Try to avoid doing this just before bedtime.
• Notice when a worry pops into your mind: if you notice that you have started worrying at any time outside the planned
worry time, tell yourself: It’s OK to have this worry, but I’m going to put off thinking about it until my worry time. I will have
time to think about it later. I will be able to deal with this problem later.
• Note down your worries: you might find it helpful to carry a notebook to quickly write down the worry thought, and then
close the book until worry time. Don’t be concerned if the same thought pops back again very quickly. It is very common to
experience repeated worry thoughts. Just repeat the same process: accept the thought, write it down and then postpone it
for later.
• Focus on your daily life: after noting down your worry, close the book, focus your attention back onto the present moment
and concentrate on whatever activity you are carrying out. This will help to let go of the worry until worry time arrives later
on.
• Review your worries during worry time: when it comes to your planned worry time, you can look through your list of wor-
ries. Cross anything off the list that is no longer a worry for you. Allow yourself to worry for up to 30 minutes. Try to also
focus on some problem-solving ideas by asking yourself: Is there anything I can do to help this situation?
• Move on to another activity: don’t spend any longer than planned during worry time. Afterwards, try to move quickly onto
another activity that is likely to take your mind away from your worries and lift your mood, such as exercise, listening to
music or calling a friend.

This is a rapidly-evolving area and this information is a guide only, to help you think and plan ahead. If you have
contact with a patient with, or concerned about, COVID-19, you MUST check the relevant government websites to
ensure you are following the latest guidance. This document was last updated at 7am Wednesday 18th March 2020.
UPDATED! Checklist for primary care
Oversight and leadership
Appoint a COVID-19 lead to oversee the implementation of all things relating to coronavirus.
Are you checking regularly what the latest definitions and advice are?
Avoiding exposure in the first place
The NHS advice to patients with FEVER OR NEW CONTINUOUS COUGH is that they should NOT present to primary
care but use online 111 advice, and call 111 only if they cannot cope with their symptoms at home, they are getting
worse or their symptoms are not improving after 7 days; 111 will then arrange appropriate care.
To reduce the chance of someone turning up with the infection in the first place:
Have you got information on your website?
Have you got notices on your doors?
Are reception staff screening patients as they book in/on arrival?
Are you screening all people requesting home visits by phoning ahead and checking symptoms?
How will you manage online bookings to ensure patients are screened before attending?
Advice to patients
Have you communicated key information to patients about what to do if coronavirus is suspected?
Do you have clear advice for those advised to ‘stay at home’?
Keeping patients safe
Does everyone in the practice know what to do if:
Someone contacts the practice with respiratory symptoms but no travel/contact history?
Someone presents at reception with suspected COVID-19?
A suspected case is identified during a consultation?
Someone with suspected COVID-19 needs immediate care/immediate transfer to hospital?
Preparedness
Be prepared:
Identify an isolation room and declutter it now.
Prepare a patient 'support pack' for this room.
Do staff have appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)?
Do staff know how to correctly put on/remove PPE?
Do staff know how to dispose of this PPE after use?
Do staff know how to decontaminate a room after use?
Do those who do home visits have PPE and TWO clinical waste bags in their vehicle?
Key documents
NHS England Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for primary care have now been produced; this article is based
on the SOPs, and our services should be modelled on these (as published on 6/3/20, summarised in this article and
available here): https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/20200305-COVID-19-PRIMARY-CARE-
SOP-GP-PUBLICATION-V1.1.pdf
Most of the clinical material in this document is based on the SOPs/Public Health England advice. Other useful re-
sources are given at the end of this document.
At Red Whale, we recognise that in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, things may be slightly different. However,
we do not have the resources to update this document 4 times each time something changes (which seems to be sev-
eral times a week at present!). We are very sorry!
The Scottish information is available here: https://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/a-to-z-of-topics/wuhan-novel-coronavirus/
Public Health Wales: https://phw.nhs.wales/topics/latest-information-on-novel-coronavirus-covid-19/
Northern Ireland information is here: https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/news/covid-19-coronavirus
What is the role of primary care in the current situation?
• Identify potential cases as soon as possible.
• Prevent potential transmission of infection to other patients, staff and the wider community.
• Offer appropriate care to those affected, whether this be at home or admission.
• Still do all the usual work of primary care that can’t be delayed!
NEW! What are the key changes?
I have flagged the key changes with NEW! so you can identify them without reading the whole document! The big
changes are:
• A ‘possible case’ (in the community) is someone with FEVER or NEW CONTINUOUS COUGH.
• The duration of self-isolation (now called ‘stay at home’) has changed.
• Those not ill enough to require admission will not be tested.
• Those over 70 or in vulnerable groups are asked to separate themselves from social contact as much as possible.
• There is now new guidance for care homes, which I have summarised briefly.
• What is the link between ibuprofen and COVID-19?
• What is the link between ACE inhibitors/ARBs and COVID-19?
What is COVID-19?
• COVID-19 is a new RNA virus from the coronavirus family that includes SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)
and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). It is thought to have started in a fish/animal market in China.
• The main method of transmission is respiratory droplets, or, in a healthcare setting, contact with bodily fluids.
• Treatment is supportive. It is not known if antivirals are effective. There is currently no vaccine.
The BMJ suggests (BMJ 202;368:m800):
• Median incubation 5–6 days (range 0–14).
• >80% have mild disease, 15% get severe disease including pneumonia, 5% become critically unwell.
• Mortality 2% overall (0.2% in those <50y, 15% in those >80y). Those with chronic diseases are also at higher risk.
NEW! When should you consider COVID-19?
IMPORTANT: THIS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY ON MONDAY 17 MARCH:
• The virus is assumed to be moving freely in the community so travel history or contact with an infected person
are not required to suspect COVID-19.
• Those being admitted will be tested. There is clear guidance on how to manage these patients (summarised be-
low).
• Those with ‘possible COVID-19’ (defined below) who are well enough to stay at home are asked to self-isolate
ALONG WITH THEIR WHOLE HOUSEHOLD and follow ‘stay at home’ guidance for a period of time (see section on
returning to normal activities for details of how long ’stay at home’ guidance should be followed for).

https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/news/covid-19-coronavirus
Definition of ‘possible case’ in those well enough to remain in the community:
• New continuous cough.
• High temperature (not defined in primary care criteria, ≥37.8 in hospital definition).
(Remember: immunocompromised patients may present in atypical ways.)
‘Possible cases’ who remain in the community should be directed to the 111 online symptom checker which says
(PHE guidance):
• If they are very unwell, they should contact 111 on the phone and wait to speak to a nurse.
• If they are relatively well, they should follow the online ‘stay at home’ advice. They should not contact 111 by
phone unless they cannot manage their symptoms at home, their condition is deteriorating or their symptoms are
not getting better after 7 days. They should NOT go to a GP, pharmacy or hospital.
However, we know that some of these patients will contact us, and we will need to assess them – and there doesn’t
appear to be any Public Health England guidance on how we manage these individuals. Many of us are implementing
extensive telephone triage as a first-line strategy.
Health Protection Scotland suggests the following should be considered:
• Segregating patients with respiratory symptoms.
• Trying to see them in designated areas and at the end of lists.
• Using designated staff.
• PPE should be worn for any assessment of those with respiratory symptoms.
Definition of ‘possible case’ in those requiring admission:
Anyone requiring admission to hospital who has ANY of the following:
Influenza-like illness
OR
Clinical/radiological evidence of pneumonia
OR
Acute respiratory distress
Influenza-like illness is defined as T≥37.8C AND at least 1 of (acute onset) sore throat, hoarseness, sneezing, nasal
congestion/discharge, cough, wheeze, shortness of breath.
The guidance also reminds us that those who do not meet the COVID-19 criteria but have risk factors for avian flu or
MERS-CoV should be assessed/tested for these infections (we are thinking this is for hospital cases only).
• Avian flu criteria are here (briefly, require illness + close contact (within 1m) with live/dying/dead poultry in a part
of the world where avian flu is common in the past 10d (mainly Asia) https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/gov-
ernment/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/857436/Avian_flu_human_cases_guidance_Jan2020.pdf
• MERS-COV criteria are outlined here (but briefly, requires illness + middle east travel): https://assets.publish-
ing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/732267/Algorithm_case_v31-
Aug2018.pdf
NEW! Healthcare workers and staff: when should staff not work?
ANYONE (including NHS staff) with ‘possible COVID-19’ symptoms (fever or new persistent cough) OR with a house-
hold member with possible COVID-19 should follow ‘stay at home’ guidance (see section on returning to normal activ-
ities for details of how long ’stay at home’ guidance should be followed for).
NHS staff tend to suffer from presenteeism, rather than absenteeism, so make sure your staff know you really don’t
want to see them at work if they have any symptoms, and that knocking back a few paracetamol and soldiering on
is NOT acceptable and puts others at risk! Remember that for some, the financial implications of this mean they
may be reluctant to report symptoms – have you specifically decided on how you will handle sick pay during such
leave?

NEW! ‘Stay at home’ guidance for those with ‘possible COVID-19’
For those with ‘possible COVID-19’ who do not need admission, a test will not be offered, but they will be advised that
the whole household should follow
‘stay at home’ (see section on returning to normal activities for details of how
long ’stay at home’ guidance should be followed for)
111 does NOT need to be informed if a person is self-isolating in these situations.
What does ‘stay at home’ mean?
To protect others in the community
• Not leaving the house and, if living with others, minimising sharing space with others.
In an ideal world, this means:
• Sleeping alone.
• Not sharing a bed, toothbrush, crockery, towels or food.
• Staying in one room, into which others do not go, as much as possible. If rooms do need to be shared, using them
when others are not present.
• If possible, using a separate bathroom; if this is not possible, the patient cleans the bathroom after each use.
• If possible, having meals brought to the room rather than the patient preparing them in a shared space.
• Regular handwashing by all in the household, with the patient having a separate towel from the rest of the house-
hold.
Looking after self
• Identify those who can help provide supplies (dropping on the doorstep, not stopping to chat!), and keeping in
touch by phone/social media, not face to face.
• Can you exercise? If essential, yes, but keep a safe distance (at least 2m) from others.
• Can you go in the garden? Yes.
• Breastfeeding is safe (there is no evidence that COVID-19 is transmitted through breast milk).
• Pets are not at risk of getting coronavirus.
Detailed patient guidance is available here:

with-confirmed-or-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection
NEW! Returning to normal activity
This is complicated and slightly different advice is given on NHS and PHE sites. This is what we think they mean, and
clinically this makes sense!
The rationale, I think is this:
• Isolation of symptomatic people reduces spread.
• Isolating asymptomatic people who live with a symptomatic person stops the asymptomatic person spreading it
whilst incubating it, before they develop symptoms. This reduces spread to the community.
So the principles are:
• Those who develop symptoms must self-isolate for SEVEN days. After 7 days, if they are well, they can return to
normal activities. After coronavirus, people are likely to continue to cough for some weeks: they can return to nor-
mal even if they are still coughing.
• EVERYONE in the household of the index case needs to isolate for FOURTEEN days (to stop spread to the com-
munity). (Index case =
first person to get sick in the household).
o If during the 14d, a household member develops symptoms, they can return to normal activities SEVEN days
after the first day of their symptoms (provided when they are well) (even if they are still within the fourteen
days (they are no longer a risk to the community as they have had it and got better).
o Any member of the household who do NOT develop symptoms, can return to normal activities after FOUR-
TEENS days isolation FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THE INDEX CASE’S SYMPTOMS (you do not need to keep re-
starting the 14 day clock each time a person gets sick)

REMEMBER: after coronavirus, people are likely to continue to cough for some weeks: they can return to normal even
if they are still coughing.
For those who have tested positive for COVID-19/been admitted:
• They will be given specific advice on discharge.
NEW! Advice for vulnerable groups and over-70s
Who are we talking about?
High-risk groups Very high-risk groups (more announcements on this
group expected next week)
• Those who are pregnant.
• Those over 70, regardless of any medical conditions.
• Those adults under 70 who qualify for a flu jab,
which means:
o Long-term respiratory conditions.
o Chronic heart disease.
o Chronic kidney disease.
o Chronic liver disease.
o Chronic neurological conditions.
o Diabetes.
o After a splenectomy/sickle cell disease.
o Weakened immune system: HIV/AIDS, on ster-
oids, having chemo.
o Severe obesity (BMI ≥40).
• Post-transplant.
• Those with cancer having active chemo/radiother-
apy.
• Those with haematological cancers (at any stage of
treatment).
• Severe chest conditions (CF, asthmatics who require
admission/oral steroids).
• Severe diseases such as those needing dialysis.
What is suggested?
Social distancing: reducing interaction between people, which means:
• Avoiding contact with those who have symptoms.
• Avoiding non-essential use of public transport – if you have to use it, use it at less busy times.
• Working from home if possible.
• Avoiding large gatherings and gatherings in small public spaces (e.g. pubs, theatre, cinemas, restaurants).
• Avoiding gathering with friends and family – use technology to keep in touch.
• Contacting essential services (GP, etc.) by phone/online means.
• Looking after your physical and mental health, despite all of the above!
For those living with vulnerable groups:
If someone in the household a vulnerable person lives in gets COVID-19 symptoms, be particularly careful to follow
the guidance on self-isolation within the home to minimise contact between the ill person and the vulnerable person
as much as possible.
NEW! Care homes
Detailed information for various different care settings is available here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publica-
tions/covid-19-residential-care-supported-living-and-home-care-guidance
In brief, this suggests:
Ensuring all staff:
• Self-isolate if they develop any COVID-19-type symptoms (fever, new persistent cough).
• Wash hands regularly and use appropriate PPE if residents are symptomatic.
Visitors:
• Asking those with COVID-19 symptoms/those who are generally feeling unwell not to visit.
• Ensuring good hand hygiene for all visitors.
Patients:
• Nursing in a single room with en suite if possible.
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-residential-care-supported-living-and-home-care-guidance
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-residential-care-supported-living-and-home-care-guidance
There is also guidance on how to manage waste and linen from infected patients in the document listed above.
Put measures in place to stop patients with COVID-19 coming to the surgery/prepare for if they do
Put all necessary measures in place to prevent a patient turning up at the surgery.
• Make sure patients are aware that they should not come to the surgery by putting messages on your website,
sending text messages, and getting receptionists to screen patients when they ring for an appointment/home
visit.
The key message is:
If you suspect you have any coronavirus symptoms (fever or new persistent cough):
• Use the 111 online coronavirus service to find out what to do next (it’s a few simple questions and then tells you
what to do). Only call 111 if you are significantly unwell and can not cope with your symptoms at home.
• Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.
In Scotland, call your GP or NHS 24 on 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, call 0300 200 7885.
NEW! If a patient contacts the surgery and thinks they may have COVID-19/fever/new cough
If a patient with FEVER or NEW, PERISTENT COUGH contacts primary care:
• If they are CRITICALLY UNWELL: call an ambulance. Tell the call handler this is a ‘possible COVID-19’ case.
• If not critically unwell, they should be referred to the 111 online app or 111 service. The 111 online symptom
checker says:
o If they are very unwell, they should contact 111 on the phone and wait to speak to a nurse.
o If they are relatively well, they should follow ‘stay at home’ advice and NOT go to a GP, pharmacy or hospital.
There is no clear guidance on what primary care does if, after contacting 111, a patient wants advice from primary
care. Clearly, if we are telephone triaging these patients, we will be making a judgement call as to whether COVID-19
is the best explanation, or whether, as is inevitable, there may be other explanations, e.g. croup, bronchiolitis, that
may need a different management strategy.
Health Protection Scotland suggests the following should be considered:
• Segregating patients with respiratory symptoms.
• Trying to see them in designated areas and at the end of lists.
• PPE should be worn for any assessment of those with respiratory symptoms/influenza-like illness.
How to communicate this to patients: suggested patient information for your telephone system and for texts, online
booking service and practice website is available in appendix 1 of this document: https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-
content/uploads/2020/02/20200305-COVID-19-PRIMARY-CARE-SOP-GP-PUBLICATION-V1.1.pdf
Who needs what PPE?
• Clinical staff need disposable aprons, gloves and fluid-resistant surgical masks (gowns and eye protection needed
if doing an aerosol-generating procedure: in primary care, this means CPR and manual ventilation, but nebuliser
use is NOT on the list).
• Cleaners need disposable gloves and aprons.
• Reception staff do NOT need PPE.
All staff should know how to put on and remove PPE, and how to dispose of it, and must do this before leaving the
contaminated area (in our surgery, we have put a PPE removal guide on the back of each door).
Instructions on how to put on and remove PPE are available here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wu-
han-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control.
• If PPE is used on a home visit, it must be removed at the house and then DOUBLE bagged while being transported
back to the surgery for disposal.
Be prepared for a scenario where patients turn up unexpectedly
• Identify a room to act as an isolation room (a room that could be decommissioned for a period before it was ap-
propriately decontaminated, with a phone, near a toilet that could also be put out of action until decontami-
nated?).

• Declutter it now so that non-essential furnishings and items are removed to aid decontamination after an event.
Keep the phone in the room – you may need this to communicate with the patient!
• Place a card in the room so that patients who are left alone in it will know what is to happen next.
• Prepare a 'support pack' for this room – bottled water, disposable tissues, clinical waste disposal facility, fluid-re-
sistant surgical mask.
If you identify a patient in the surgery who may have COVID-19
This section is based on PHE and NHSE guidance for primary care/standard operating procedures, written at a time
when ‘suspected COVID-19’ was defined as clinical features + travel/contact history. The definitions have now
changed, and we talk about ‘possible COVID-19’. It is not clear how much of this still applies BUT, at the time of writ-
ing (17/3/20), these documents are all still live. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wn-cov-guidance-for-
primary-care/wn-cov-interim-guidance-for-primary-care
At present, none of these scenarios should occur: but what if they do?
To reduce the risk of these scenarios happening: make sure you are screening patients before they arrive/before a
home visit is agreed.
Patient presents at reception
with suspected coronavirus
Consultation started,
then coronavirus becomes a possibility
• Advise to go home immediately and use the 111
symptom checker and advice.
• If too unwell/unwilling to leave surgery: isolate
them (+ any relatives and any clinical waste) im-
mediately.
• Leave the room, closing the door behind you.
• Wash your hands thoroughly.
• Complete the consultation via telephone.
• Avoid physical examination of a suspected case.
• If the patient is relatively well, then you may decide to send them home (you can complete the assessment
over the phone) (the guidance says ring 111, but that is now out of date advise!)
• While the patient remains at the surgery:
o Ensure no one enters the room.
o Keep in regular contact with the patient while they are at the surgery, either on the phone or by talking to
them through the closed door.
o Do NOT enter the room unless the patient is very unwell, and then only if wearing appropriate PPE.
• If the patient needs to use the lavatory:
o Inform them to go to the lavatory and return to their room immediately afterwards.
o They should be told to wash their hands thoroughly afterwards.
o The lavatory should then not be used by anyone else until thoroughly cleaned (following advice on decon-
tamination from the relevant authorities).
• If it is essential to enter a room where a patient is being isolated (i.e. the patient is very unwell):
o Wear PPE in line with standard infection control precautions, such as gloves, apron and fluid-resistant surgi-
cal mask. Afterwards, dispose of PPE as clinical waste.
o Keep exposure to a minimum.
o Once the patient has left the building, DO NOT ENTER/USE the isolation room/lavatory until it has been
appropriately decontaminated.
Patient presenting with suspected coronavirus
during a home visit
• Take the patient’s telephone number, leave the room, close the door and wash your hands thoroughly.
• The guidance says ask the patient /career to ring 111 but this is based on out of date guidance. I think most of
us would try to complete the assessment from outside the room/on the phone/put PPE on .
If the patient needs immediate aid, apply appropriate PPE. On removal, this should be DOUBLE bagged for transit
(so visiting staff need PPE + TWO clinical waste bags).
• If the patient is in a care home: contact 111 AND inform the local health protection team to discuss possible
contact tracing, decontamination and further follow-up.
If the patient requires urgent transfer to hospital
• Inform the ambulance service call handlers that it is ‘possible coronavirus’.
• All potential admissions MUST be discussed with the hospital first, to ensure they are appropriately prepared.

How to arrange laboratory testing
Testing is not routinely offered unless patients are ill enough to need admission. Results are taking up to 72 hours to
come back.
If you are asked about which tests are needed, see here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/up-
loads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/866111/COVID-19_Suspected_cases_sam-

Decontamination of primary care facilities
This section is based on PHE and NHSE guidance for primary care/standard operating procedures, written at a time
when ‘suspected COVID-19’ was defined as clinical features + travel/contact history. The definitions have now
changed, and we talk about ‘possible COVID-19. It is not clear how much of this still applies BUT, at the time of writing,
(17/3/20) these documents are all still live.
Practices are responsible for the supply of clinical materials and PPE for staff, and ensuring they know how to use
them. Cleaners should wear disposable gloves and an apron.
Practices may need to close temporarily for cleaning of community areas: follow usual business continuity arrange-
ments. However, the aim is that practices should remain OPEN unless advised to close by the health protection team.
• The room itself: once the patient has been transferred to the appropriate setting:
o Shut the door, open the windows and switch the air conditioning OFF.
o The room then needs to be decontaminated.
o After decontamination, the room can be put back into immediate use.
• Communal areas (waiting room, toilet):
o Any blood/body fluids should be cleaned up immediately.
o Clean the areas with detergent and disinfectant as soon as practically possible; once done, the room can be
put back into immediate use.
All waste should be removed from the room and quarantined until the patient test results are known; if the patient is
confirmed as having COVID-19, take advice from the local health protection team on what to do next. Your local
health protection team can be found at: at www.gov.uk/health-protection-team.
Follow section 4 of this document for the nitty gritty of how to do it:

tions/wn-cov-guidance-for-primary-care/wn-cov-interim-guidance-for-primary-care
Contact tracing
This will the responsibility of the public health teams.
The idea is to identify all those who the patient has come into contact with, assess the risk to those individuals and
contact/offer advice/test if appropriate.

UPDATED! Ibuprofen/NSAIDs and COVID-19
What is the latest? The current advice (letter from Prof Stephen Powls, Medical Director NHSE) says:
• Unpublished data from France, which the UK authorities have not seen, has led to the French Health minister ad-
vising against the use of ibuprofen.
• There is no current published evidence that NSAIDs have an impact on COVID-19.
However, the NICE/Committee of Human Medicines (an advisory body of the MHRA) have been asked to review the
evidence.
• In the meantime, those with/suspected to have COVID-19 should use paracetamol in preference to NSAIDs.
• Those on NSAIDs for other medical reasons (e.g. arthritis) should not stop them.
NEW! What about ACE inhibitors/ARBs and COVID-19?

Those with comorbidities (including hypertension) are at increased risk of death from COVID-19 infections. There has
been some speculation that ACE inhibitors/ARBs may further increase the risk of serious illness/death from COVID-19.
The European Society of Cardiology (and many other bodies around the world) has been quick to use a statement dis-
missing this (https://www.escardio.org/Councils/Council-on-Hypertension-(CHT)/News/position-statement-of-the-
esc-council-on-hypertension-on-ace-inhibitors-and-ang):
“Speculation about the safety of ACE-inhibitors or ARB treatment in relation to COVID-19 does not have a sound scien-
tific basis or evidence to support it. Indeed, there is evidence from studies in animals suggesting that these medications
might be rather protective against serious lung complications in patients with COVID-19 infection, but to date there is
no data in humans.
The Council on Hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology wish to highlight the lack of any evidence support-
ing harmful effect of ACE-I and ARB in the context of the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak.
The Council on Hypertension strongly recommend that physicians and patients should continue treatment with their
usual anti-hypertensive therapy because there is no clinical or scientific evidence to suggest that treatment with ACEi
or ARBs should be discontinued because of the COVID-19 infection.”
If you see people on ACE inhibitors/ARBs, remember to reassure them about this and check they are still taking
their tablets!
