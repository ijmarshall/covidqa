Other important terms

This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms, whether under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties Act) 1999 or otherwise.

If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations.

Hot Topics Diabetes for Primary Care Courses
Independent, unbiased, relevant
In association with Diabetes UK
The Diabetes for Primary Care course is ideal for all GPs, practice nurses and pharmacists needing an update in diabetes, and not just for GPs with a special interest. As diabetes becomes ever more common and at the same time the management becomes more complex, this course is needed more than ever.
Read More
Topics will include changes to diagnosis and classification, individualising HbA1c targets and treatment choices (‘What next after metformin?’), insulin conversion in primary care, cardiovascular risk reduction, diabetes in special groups (e.g. pregnancy) and management with co-morbidities such as chronic kidney disease and much more.
Fully supported by its own detailed paper and electronic course book, the course attracts 6 hours of CPD, is accredited by the RCGP and the ICGP and supported by Diabetes UK.
Excellent course. Covered all the topics relevant to diabetes in primary care.
Good summary of evidence, well presented, excellent booklet and supporting materials

Since the start of 2020 coronavirus has hit the world and caused unprecedented levels of concern among public and
health professionals alike.
This is an evolving field - until identification in China in December this was an unknown pathogen – so what we discuss
here today may be out of date in a week. With this in mind at the end of this chapter, we include a range of resources
that frequently update as our understanding of the disease and how it affects the world changes. We will try to update
this page as new information is published - it is currently up to date for the 18.3.2020.
► What is it?► What is it?
Coronaviruses are a broad range of viruses which at one end of the spectrum cause the common cold, at the other end
cause potentially fatal disease such as MERS and SARS.
This new virus is named SARS-Cov-2, the disease it causes is COVID-19. DNA analysis shows it is closely related to
SARS and similarly evolved from a virus affecting bats. As we all know, this then spread in Wuhan, China, and
subsequently worldwide, although the speculation it was initially transmitted from zoonotic sources in a seafood market
in the city has not been confirmed.
SARS-Cov-2 has been isolated in at least 66 countries around the world. One can speculate that where countries have
no cases this may be due to lack of testing rather than truly escaping the condition.
► How is it spread?► How is it spread?
There remains uncertainty about the mechanism of spread. Human-to-human transmission is now undisputed, although
the degree of infectivity is still uncertain. The virus is predominantly respiratory droplet spread among closepredominantly respiratory droplet spread among close
contacts (e.g. within 2m) for prolonged periods or direct contact with infected secretionscontacts (e.g. within 2m) for prolonged periods or direct contact with infected secretions (the virus has been
isolated in most bodily secretions including faeces - time to close that lid when flushing...). It can survive on surfaces
outside the body, although for how long is unclear – it is assumed to behave like other coronaviruses which can last for
hours to several days depending on the conditions.
► What is the incubation period?► What is the incubation period?
The average incubation period is 5-6 days but it is very variable and can range from 1-14 days.
People are infective when symptoms manifestPeople are infective when symptoms manifest. Currently, there is no data on patients transmitting the disease
without symptoms, although viral shedding has been found in the 1-2 days prior to symptomsviral shedding has been found in the 1-2 days prior to symptoms, for up to 2 weeks in
respiratory samples, and 4-5 weeks in faeces. The significance of this shedding regarding infectivity is currently
uncertain. Concern remains that people may be asymptomatic vectors (there are a handful of case reports showing this
to be the case).
► What are the clinical features?► What are the clinical features?
The main features are fever, cough or chest tightness, and dyspnoea.The main features are fever, cough or chest tightness, and dyspnoea. However, a paper published in the BMJ
shows that patients may well have none of thesepatients may well have none of these - fever was present in 77%, cough 81%, fatigue/myalgia 52%,
headache 34%, diarrhoea in 8%. This was in patients admitted to hospital, so it is very possible that many in the
community will have minor symptoms only and none of the above. This will make it impossible to distinguish between
coronavirus and 'normal' infections.
Indeed it appears that 80% will have mild symptoms (or none), 15% will be severely unwell, 5% critically unwell80% will have mild symptoms (or none), 15% will be severely unwell, 5% critically unwell.
The most at risk are the elderlyThe most at risk are the elderly (particularly >80yo), and those with significant co-morbidityand those with significant co-morbidity. Interestingly children
appear to be rarely affected, although it is still possible for them to be seriously ill and not clear whether asymptomatic
children can still be vectors for disease. Pregnant women were high risk during the swine flu outbreak, but so far this
hasn't appeared to be a particular issue for COVID-19.
www.nbmedical.com
https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m606
https://www.nbmedical.com
In Chinese patients admitted to hospital sepsis was seen in 59%, respiratory failure in 54%, Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome 31%, heart failure 23%, septic shock 20%, coagulopathy 19%, acute kidney injury 15%... the list goes on.
25% had ICU admission, with an average ICU admission length of 8 days. It becomes clear how secondary care
resources will be stretched although it is worth reiterating this study was looking specifically at unwell admitted patients
and is in no way representative of what we are likely to see in general practice.
One important piece of information published in The Lancet is the time from onset of symptoms to serious illness. The
median time to hospital admission is 7 days, SOB 8 days, ARDS 9 days and ICU admission 10.5 days. The clear
learning point here is that safety netting, warning patients to monitor for escalating symptoms, is critical - if we see an
infected patient at day 3, four days later may be a very different picture.
The guidance also states we need to consider avian flu (it never rains but it pours) in patients with travel to China in the
past 10 days, and MERS if travel to the Middle East in the past 14 days, if presenting with fever and lower respiratory
tract symptoms, although provides no information on how to differentiate between diseases.
► What is the prognosis?► What is the prognosis?
This is the million-dollar question and very hard to answer meaningfully. Mortality is thought to be around 1-2%around 1-2%, some
reports have suggested slightly higher but this is likely to be biased through testing of mostly high risk individuals. Given
there appears widespread transmission in the community the number of proven cases will be an underestimate of true
disease (although we don't know by how much) and the real case fatality rate is presumably lower.
However, in the elderly population, the mortality rate is significant at around 15-20%in the elderly population, the mortality rate is significant at around 15-20%.
► What is being recommended to the public?► What is being recommended to the public?
Recommendations on testing have changed significantly in the past week.
For now, there will now be NO testing of patients in the community. The new case definition:
Anyone with a new continuous cough or high fever (community definition does not specify a figure)
These cases are presumed COVID-19 and should self-isolate for 7 days
If they live with other people the other members of the household should self-isolate for 14 days. People at home
should try to keep away from each other as much as possible.
The rationale for this is that most infection is transmitted between household units, symptoms normally manifest
within 7 days and so 14 days allows for the possible incubation period and then infective period of exposed
household members, knowing that some may be asymptomatic but still contagious.
High risk individuals in the household (e.g. >70s) should find somewhere else to stay for 14 days if possible
Be alert that immunosuppressed patients may have atypical presentations.
Social distancing is now recommended for everyone, including large and small gatherings, and especially recommended
for high risk individuals (>70yo, those with significant medical problems - essentially anyone who is entitled to an NHS
flu vaccine - and pregnant women). Communities will need to try and support each other as much as possible as the
government recommends limiting movement outside of the house.
Remember, this includes US as well. Clinicians should self-isolate if unwell - we need to fight our ingrained belief to turn
up to work no matter what. Here it really isn't the best thing to do for your colleagues or patients.
The lack of testing of HCP is of particular concern. Rates of staff shortages are likely to be high, and if we end up self-
isolating for infections which are non-coronavirus this is a waste of valuable resources. Hopefully the increased capacity
for testing the government has promised will be available soon and 'critical services' will be prioritised.
► What is the hospital case definition and who will be tested?What is the hospital case definition and who will be tested?
Patients with possible COVID-19 who are admitted to hospital will be considered for testing. The new hospital case
definition is now simplified and travel history is now irrelevant:
Any patient requiring hospital admission and either:

Clinical or radiological evidence of pneumonia, ARDS or influenza-like illness (fever 37.8+ & 1+ of any respiratory
symptom)
► How should we manage people in residential homes or who are housebound?How should we manage people in residential homes or who are housebound?
This boils down to staff and residents recognising symptoms and self-isolating if present, good hand hygiene, limiting
visitors and careful cleaning.
Detailed guidance can be found here.
► How is testing done?► How is testing done?
Testing is predominantly with PCRTesting is predominantly with PCR and only available is specific laboratories. Nose and throat swabs, plus sputum if
possible is preferred. Turn-around time is suggested to be 48h, although in practice most patients have a result within
24h. We don't have figures on the sensitivity and specificity, but in general, PCR is considered very good, although
doubt remains over the reliability of a negative result. Confirmed cases who are hospitalised may have serology.
If/when testing is performed routinely outside of the reference labs the result is considered presumptive and then needs
further confirmatory testing in the reference lab, but that patient should be treated as a confirmed case until proven
otherwise.
What seems unclear (te NB authors cannot find information on this currently) is at what point a test becomes positive.
At the point of symptoms, there will be plenty of viral shedding and the test should be accurate, but can a negative test
be relied upon is a high risk patient is asymptomatic but still in the incubation period? This leads us on to the next
question...
► Are there treatments?► Are there treatments?
Whilst a range of treatments such as anti-retrovirals for HIV and Ebola, oseltamivir, monoclonal antibodies (using AI to
quickly identify possible effective ones based on viral protein profiles) and more complex ICU-based interventions are
being tested, at this point, nothing has been clearly beneficial and supportive therapy remains key.
Vaccines have already been produced, which is absolutely remarkable, but require human testing, ideally RCTs, and
are unlikely to be widely available (assuming they work and don't have nasty side effects) until 2021.
► What about ibuprofen?What about ibuprofen?
This speculative claim that NSAIDs could worsen the prognosis in COVID-19 came from a French doctor, amplified by a
French health minister and then spread globally via social media.
There is no data that ibuprofen or NSAIDs may worsen outcomes from COVID-19, although there is no data refute the
hypothesis either. There is data that shows that other respiratory tract infections (and UTI) made be prolonged or have
increased complications with NSAID use.
The government released a statement today stating there is no data to support this claim, has asked the MHRAthere is no data to support this claim, has asked the MHRA
and NICE to review any data, and in the meantime it may be prudent to initially use paracetamol in preference.and NICE to review any data, and in the meantime it may be prudent to initially use paracetamol in preference.

The other piece of fake news to spread via social media was that ACEi/ARB could also worsen prognosis due to
coronavirus using ACE2 to infect people, and ACEi/ARB elevating these levels. There has been a robust international
response to this claim stating it lacks any sound scientific basis and no evidence shows this effect. RecommendationsRecommendations

► What should practices do?► What should practices do?
There is specific guidance set out by PHE in the Special Operating Procedures document which needs to be digested
and acted upon.
There are several elements to protecting our patients and ourselves:
Advice from NHS England is to move to TOTAL remote triage of all patients in general practice using telephone or
internet. Anything that can be managed remotely should be. This will call for pragmatic medicine, something GPs
excel at.
If patients with possible COVID-19 present at the practice, if they are well they should be directed home to self-
isolate and if unwell, we need to isolate them in the practice, get out of personal protective equipment, assess them.
Treat if necessary, otherwise call 111 for back up. Then decontaminate yourself and the room.
Practices should identify a dedicated room for isolation, declutter it to facilitate cleaning, and have easy access to
PPE. We will need to know how to decontaminate ourselves and rooms.
Encourage good hand hygiene in patients and staffEncourage good hand hygiene in patients and staff attending the practice to reduce the risk of cross-
contamination.
Have clear information at access points to the surgery with the latest guidance on what to do (i.e. don't just turn up,
call and we'll contact you).
► Do face m► Do face masks help?!?asks help?!?
Complicated, and hampered by confusing data involving a plethora of different types of face masks. The European
Centre of Disease Prevention and Control recommends for suspected or proven cases the ideal face mask is an FFP3
(or an FFP2 if the former not available). These are fitted face masks which usually have a valve to enable prolonged
use.
In primary care, we have been given simple surgical masks. Interestingly a JAMA editorial highlights research which
shows if clinician and patient wear these masks the protection is as good as an FFP3 mask when having prolonged
exposure to infected patients.
In the general population, it is felt that such masks are unlikely to reduce transmission.
► Do we know how the disease will progress?► Do we know how the disease will progress?
Time to get out your crystal balls. Experts have used modelling data and the situations in Wuhan and northern Italy to
try and build a picture of how the infection will spread but nothing is certain. The main points:
It is likely to spread with escalating numbers of cases.
The number of cases is likely to increase rapidly over the next few weeks.
The duration of the outbreak is unclear, but we will probably see high numbers of cases for several months.
Slowing the rate of increase is helpful to ease winter pressures on health services, to allow time to build resources
such as testing kits, protective equipment, etc., and to spread cases over a longer period.
Lessons can be taken from the Chinese governments' management of the situation, with a large scale, very restrictive
lock-down. Whilst extreme, cases in the country are now falling and wide-spread transmission throughout China
appears to have been prevented. Italy appears to have gone in the same direction.
This may be difficult to implement in other Western societies, plus would have significant implications on economies,
which in the end could also cause loss of life. These will be discussions for our politicians guided by the experts.
There is even doubt that these methods will have a lasting benefit and that when the restrictions are lifted a furtherwhen the restrictions are lifted a further
rise in cases is likelyrise in cases is likely. Only time will tell, but it will build on our knowledge for the next pandemic.
► Final thoughtsFinal thoughts
This is a desperately difficult time for everybody with pressures we can't have imagined a year ago. Much of this is
about the uncertainty of what will happen over the next few weeks.

So let's remember:
Be kind to those around you, everyone is scared.
Be kind to yourself, our job is hard at the best of times, not every decision we make will be right, but it will be the
best we could do at the time with the resources, both internal and external, that were available.
Remember to eat, drink, take a break, exercise.
You can't do everything. We may need to pitch in a bit extra, but you need time too.
Do something you enjoy whenever you can.
Social media can be frenzied and often fan the flames of worry. Ask yourself if you really need to be on Twitter right
now and avoid SM near bedtime.
Keep washing your hands...

Musculo-skeletal Course
Musculoskeletal conditions are increasingly common in General Practice, and now make up a 1/3 of all patient attendances. The ageing population, the more informed public and the growing strains on people's musculoskeletal system make this a very HOT topic for most practitioners.
During a typical GPs (or NPs) training, speciality based MSK is rare, and most of us have little ongoing support and education for dealing with even most of the common complaints. The evidence changes quickly and the thresholds to refer vary.
Lots of patients are labelled with sprains and OA and given a range of painkillers and physiotherapy. A lot of patients with chronic pain remain unidentified.
Could we do it better?
We want to help improve your approach to these patients, therefore we encourage you to attend the New Musculoskeletal Course by our
partners 'Medical Skills Courses' and their very talented faculty of tutors
They won't give you 1000 PowerPoint slides and 50 eponymous tests for the shoulder.
They won't confuse you with rare and wonderful MSK pathology.
In a tried and tested format of short snappy vignettes, case studies and live demonstrations, they will cover, literally from head to toe, all of the MSK complaints you are likely to encounter, including:
Chronic Pain
Specific Joint Pain (e.g. Shoulder, Hip, etc.)
Children
Arthritis
Red flags
Back pain
Inflammatory Conditions
Tricky Cases
With all courses you will receive a fully referenced handbook with diagrams, photographs and assessment techniques, that you can re-download with each update. You will have access to a range of high quality videos, consent forms and any other relevant national guidelines via a web link.

Hot Topics Womens Health for Primary Care Courses
Independent, unbiased, relevant
New to NB Medical, The Women’s Health Course will provide you with a comprehensive update of everything you need to feel confident in managing your patients. Whether you want a refresher around the new HRT prescribing guidance or perhaps need to feel more comfortable in managing pelvic pain in primary care, this day will cover these and other areas that many GPs have told us they feel they would like to see in a dedicated women’s health course.
Read More
These include contraceptive updates, vulval disorders, menstrual difficulties, sexual health problems and perinatal mental illness among others.
For those with DSFRH & LoCs, this will be suitable for reaccreditation CPD and for trainees who are struggling to get enough women’s health exposure, this will cover most of the curriculum.
The course and accompanying book will include a wide range of topics, presented in a way that is useful to GPs, ANPs and other professionals seeing patients in primary care.
We will ensure that this course is relevant, entertaining and that you will leave feeling more skilled than when you arrived.

Hot Topics Bespoke Educational Courses for Organisations
Hot Topics Course
NB Medical is able to provide the Hot Topics course for larger groups of GPs/Registrars/Nurses who require a GP Update outside NB Medical's Hot Topics usual course dates. Working together we can provide a tailored Hot Topics course to your Group providing a Hot Topics Lecturer, presentation, and all the normal reference book and materials that would accompany the Course. This type of meeting works particularly well for CCG's, VTS groups and Private Companies wanting to improve the level of GP Education and support in their particular area. We can select the Hot Topics to present based on your clinical priorities, which we can then merge with important locally relevant information e.g. on referral pathways etc. Our experience is that these meetings provide great ‘glue’ for CCGs.
If you are interested in finding out more please contact NB Medical hottopics@nbmedical.com

Hot Topics Cancer for Primary Care Courses
Independent, unbiased, relevant
There have been major developments in recent years in cancer prevention and treatment, so in response to this and feedback from our delegates we have developed a new Cancer for Primary Care course for 2018.
Read More
The Cancer for Primary Care Course covers new developments in cancer prevention, screening, early diagnosis, survivorship and consequences of cancer and also end of life and palliative care. The course comes with its own dedicated course book and a full suite of supporting digital learning materials.
Based around recent developments in the research literature (e.g. What is the evidence for new diagnostic tests such as FIT? What is the latest on aspirin for cancer prevention? etc.), changes to the national screening programme (e.g. the introduction of sigmoidoscopy screening) and national guidelines (e.g. NICE suspected cancer guidance). The course uses clinical cases and scenarios to highlight the learning points.
The course attracts 6 hours of CPD and is accredited by the RCGP.
Well organised, experienced speaker, innovative break sessions.
Really good, evidence based, will change my practice

Episode 11 - Coronavirus Special: Lessons for General Practice
In this week's NB Hot Topics Podcast, Neal Tucker looks at what lessons we can learn in general practice to help us prepare for and fight the coronavirus pandemic.
We can learn from our international colleagues who are ahead of us on the curve, and we speak to Dr Nadege Fancy, a GP in Milan, northern Italy, about what we can expect over the next few weeks.
We share how practices are adapting to meet the needs of our patients as the pandemic escalates in the UK.
We review what new data we know about COVID-19 and explore issues around NSAIDs, ACEi/ARBs, hydroxychloroquine and testing.
Finally, we remind us to look after ourselves. In this marathon, we need to make time for ourselves if we are to continue to look after our patients.
Added 20 March 2020
Episode 10 - Coronavirus Special: Making General Practice Great Again
With all the stress and uncertainty coronavirus has placed on the world and the health service this special podcast Dr Neal Tucker looks how we as professionals and humans are coping with COVID-19, what we need to know from the rapid changes in guidance over the past few days, and where we may be going next.
In the second half we look at what the latest science tells us about coronavirus, how it might affect our patients and what we can do to help them and ourselves.
One thing is for certain, general practice is the most adaptable branch of medicine, we have fantastic teams and camaraderie, we thrive in resource poor settings and at managing huge uncertainty on a daily basis. We can get through this together.
Added 13 March 2020
Episode 9 - Coronavirus pt.3, Salt and BP, Eggs and CVD, Why All Blood Tests are Wrong
In Episode 9 of the NB Hot Topics podcast Neal Tucker looks at the latest on coronavirus, guidance for primary care and how other countries have managed the infection. In other news he discusses the 2020 Marmot report and our patients' ""Lost Decade"".
In new research we examine two papers in the BMJ on the role of salt reduction in hypertension and egg consumption in cardiovascular disease, plus a BJGP paper on Rapid Diagnostic Clinics for patients with vauge symptoms but possible cancer.
Our in-depth topic this week is variation in blood test results and why we can't always believe what we see. The concept of the 'reference change value' may be the most important information we will discuss all year. Finally Future Medicine reports on communicating with patients in persistent vegetative state via the medium of functional MRI.
Added 06 March 2020
Episode 8 - Coronavirus pt.2, Propranolol Overdose, CKD screening, Big Data and GP
This week in the NB Hot Topics podcast Dr Near Tucker looks at the latest news including propranolol overdose and assisted dying, examines the latest research from around the world on Covid-19 and from the UK on CKD screening, then explores the murky world of big data and computer-assisted medicine and how this will affect us in general practice.
Added 21 February 2020
Episode 7 - Coronavirus, Isolated Diastolic Hypertension & Varicella Booster
In this NB Hot Topics Podcast, Dr Neal Tucker takes an in depth look at coronavirus, the data that scientists need to predict whether it becomes a pandemic, and how this affects UK general practice. He also reviews new research on isolated diastolic hypertension and whether treating this improves outcomes, and on the booster theory for adult exposure to children with chickenpox. As well we look at the latest news in cluding Ian Paterson and the new GP Contract.
Added 7 February 2020
Episode 6 - Alcohol and AF, Colchicine and Cardiac Events, Anti-virals and Influenza
In this first episode for 2020, Dr Neal Tucker explores new research on alcohol abstinence in improving atrial fibrillation, and colchicine post-myocardial infarction to reduce inflammation and prevent recurrent CVD events. We also look more in depth at the role of anti-viral medication (neuraminidase inhibitors) in the management of influenza, why we don't prescribe and whether the latest research shows any benefit and, if so, in which patients.
Added 17 January 2020
Episode 5 - Cholesterol Levels in Younger Age Predicting Future Risk, Dyspepsia Strategies, Once-Monthly POP
In this final Hot Topics Podcast before Christmas, Dr Neal Tucker explores a fascinating new piece of research showing how lipid levels at younger ages can predict future cardiovascular events and may suggest early statin therapy would be highly beneficial. He also examines the latest news and research in general practice including the best initial strategy for managing dyspepsia, how to communicate risk, and a once-monthly progesterone only capsule… in pigs…
Added 13 December 2019
Episode 4 - Dapagliflozin in Heart Failure, Melatonin for Insomnia, Suspended Animation
Dr Neal Tucker reviews the latest news and research from the medical world with a focus on primary care, including the benefit of dapagliflozin in heart failure and the lack of benefit with levothyroxine in subclinical hypothyroidism in the elderly, explores the role of melatonin in insomnia and suspended animation in humans.
Added 29 November 2019

ImpaxHub
Workforce management has never been easy, but now with Federations and Primary Care Networks sharing an increasingly mobile and flexible workforce across different organisations it has become a lot more complex. To help to make it easier for you and your partner organisations, we are delighted to be partnering with ImpaxHub to provide you with a simple solution.
ImpaxHub is a workforce management tool that allows you to manage staff across different organisations. It can help with the difficulties surrounding the management of finding cover for extended hours services, out of hours and ad hoc temporary staffing. ImpaxHub is GP led and has over 10 years’ experience in designing and developing workforce management systems combined with a vast knowledge of working in the NHS Environment.
Clarity Appraisal Toolkit Integration
We are delighted to be working in partnership with Clarity Informatics, GPs can now accumulate their learning through our extensive range of NB educational
resources, and then choose to instantly upload their CPD credits into Clarity’s market-leading Appraisal Toolkit.
Clarity TeamNet - Sharing information and learning
Clarity and NB Medical are also collaborating to make it easier for GPs to complete their CPD by making NB’s educational resources available via Clarity’s new online information-sharing platform for primary care, TeamNet. This web-based resource allows GPs, practice managers and CCGs to share essential information from a multitude of sources, including CQC compliance, CPD records, clinical decision support and appraisal evidence.
As part of the partnership, NB Medical will provide educational content for GPs via the TeamNet portal. Practices that sign up for TeamNet will gain automatic and direct access to NB Medical’s educational resources
Medical Skills Courses
Sharing our philosophy of 'By GPs for GPs' we are excited to be working with our partners at Medical Skills Courses.
For many years our delegates
have asked us, if as well as our Hot Topics and other ‘knowledge’ courses we could provide practical, skills-based courses in Minor Surgery and Joint Injection.
This is exactly what our GP colleagues at Medical Skills Courses provide.
Their courses are
small group, hands on, fun and practical but academically rigorous and receive outstanding feedback (99% of delegates say they would recommend to a colleague).
The courses are fully accredited and will allow you to meet and demonstrate standards as mandated by NHS England (to cover levels 1, 2 and 3 of the Minor
Surgery DES) and many CCGs.
We are very excited about this collaboration and as more and more minor surgery, dermatological and MSK procedures need to be done in primary care we are
confident that these courses will help you to keep your practical skills up to speed and deliver better patient care.
GP Horizon
GP Horizon is a closed, private and supportive forum for professional discussion between GPs accessible via their web-site and App on iOS / Android. It is for registered GPs only,
and is a safe space where GPs can ask questions and share clinical and non-clinical problems and issues with fellow GPs .
Founded by GP, Rima Aboud, who found that although GPs work in teams she often found her work solitary and wanted the opportunity to tap into that huge pool of experienced GPs to ask questions in a secure environment.
Arora Medical Education
Arora Medical Education is a leading provider for GP trainees preparing for their MRCGP AKT and CSA exams. Dr Aman Arora - a previous GP Training Programme Director, GP Appraiser, GMC PLAB Examiner - now works full time in Medical Education and has helped thousands of trainees pass their exams.
Arora Medical Education provides resources to match learning needs regardless of whether visual, audio or practical learner with options including Immersion day courses, Online courses, Audio courses and Mock Exams. Apart from this we provide 24/7 teaching on all major social media platforms.
As One
Our charity partner Health Poverty Action works with incredible health professionals in 17 countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America. Often the circumstances in which they work are incredibly challenging; a lack of resources, geography and political isolation make it increasingly difficult for them to do their jobs.

Medcast is one of Australia’s leading online medical educators, made up of experienced Medical Educators, Educational Technologists, Multimedia eLearning Developers and IT experts.

We may from time to time provide interactive services on our sites, including, without limitation:

Other interactive services
Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical).
We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on our sites, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks.

The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not foolproof.

These content standards apply to any and all material which you contribute to our sites (contributions), and to any interactive services associated with it.

NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors and Fear
Dr Neal Tucker -
18 Mar,
2020
Fear is the enemy of reason.
The last thing we need during this unprecedented world pandemic is fake news fueling anxiety and yet on social media yesterday a story about ibuprofen use worsening Covid-19 raced around the world throwing people into a panic. The psychology of this is hugely interesting but our time is precious right now so let’s focus on the science.
NSAIDs and Covid-19
This originated from a French doctor who tweeted about the potential risks of NSAIDs during fever and illness, a message which was then shared by the French Health Minister, who said ibuprofen should not be used during the illness. This prompted global public and scientific debate on the issue.
The concerns raised are based around theoretical risks and data regarding other ‘routine’ infections. UK Professor of Primary Care, Paul Little, recently discussed in a BMJ editorial that NSAIDs may cause an increase of pyelonephritis when taken for UTI management, but also quoted data suggesting prolonged illness or the complications of respiratory infections may be more common when NSAIDs are used (ref 1 and 2).
The theoretical mechanism here is that NSAIDs may dampen the immune response, prolonging illness, and that Covid-19 may lead to a reduction in an enzyme required in fluid and electrolyte homeostasis that was seen in SARS, given the viruses similarities.
However, there is currently no published data on the effects of NSAIDs in Covid-19 infection. Today Stephen Powis, NHS England Medical Director, clarified the position saying that:
“In view of the current lack of clarity the Committee of Human Medicines (an advisory body of MHRA) and NICE have been asked to review the evidence. It is therefore suggested that, in the interim, for patients who have confirmed Covid-19 or believe they have Covid-19, that they use paracetamol in preference to NSAIDs. Those currently on NSAIDs for other medical reasons (e.g. arthritis) should not stop them.”
ACEi/ARB and Covid-10
The other big medical scare this week was that ACEi/ARB use may also lead to worsening outcomes in Covid-19. This was another piece of speculation blown out of proportion and disseminated globally via social media.
Some Covid-19 cases in China demonstrated evidence of arterial hypertension, increasing the risk of mortality. This was then spuriously linked to how the virus infects humans: it binds to ACE2, similar to SARS. Levels of the enzyme may be raised by treatment with ACEi or ARB therefore it was suggested this may be the reason for increased mortality.
The European Society of Cardiology was quick to release a statement to reassure patients on these medications that there is no scientific basis to the claim or evidence to support it. It also reported that animal studies suggest they may in fact have a protective effect from serious lung complications although it stresses there is no data in humans as of yet.
Bottom line: do not stop your ACEi or ARB. The last thing health services around the world need right now is an increase in MIs and stroke.
Fighting the Fear
We are supporting patients through this anxious time, and a huge part of that is calm, reasoned advice based on the best information we have at the time.
New data emerges every day, we are all trying to stay on top of it. NB will do its best to help.
There will no doubt be more fake news, we need to recognise it as such and stop it in its tracks.

Course Preview - Hot Topics Spring 2020
Dr Simon Curtis -
5 Mar,
2020
The Hot Topics GP Update course webinar is fun, inspiring and informative, packed with learning points to take away to use in practice. We make it easy for you to maintain focus by keeping our presentations short, sharp and focussed.
We use clinical cases weaved in to bring the literature and guidelines to life. All the material is 100% independent and free from any external influence. All the presented material will be completely new compared to Spring 2019.
All delegates on the course will receive:
A detailed, colour 300 page Hot Topics paper book
A bigger electronic version of the book, including even more Hot Topics which is hyperlinked to all the original references and is instantly searchable
The NB Medical App, across which you can access the full content of the digital course book or just the Keep it Simple Summaries (KISS)
Post course MCQs to assess learning
The personal email address of the presenters of the course for post course follow up questions
Topics that we shall cover on the day will include:
Cardiovascular medicine	Hypertension: outline of key changes in the NICE 2019 guideline & recent research on management
Lipids: is isolated raised LDL a significant risk, should younger adults know their LDL level and new evidence on secondary prevention LDL targets
Loop diuretics, how should we use them?
Cancer	Early diagnosis of cancer: new research and developments including published results from the National Cancer Diagnosis Audit, and an update (in England) of the QOF cancer diagnosis requirements for the new Quality Improvement domain for 2020/21
(In other countries we shall replace the QOF topic, such as in Scotland we shall cover the new Scottish referral guidelines)
Lung cancer diagnosis: new research on the sensitivity of CXR and the new NHS CT ‘lung health checks’
Respiratory	Asthma: concern around increase in asthma deaths and update of latest BTS/SIGN 2019 guidelines
Chronic cough management
Smoking	E-cigarettes & vaping update
MSK	Hand OA: low dose prednisolone for flares anyone?
Women’s Health	HRT update, including the evidence leading to the 2019 breast cancer concerns and the updated NICE guidance
Perinatal mental health
Abnormal blood tests	Making sense of inflammatory markers, based on new primary care research
Mental Health	Depression, new research on initial treatment, treatment resistant depression & withdrawal effects of antidepressants
Burnout: is now defined as a condition in ICD-11, but what exactly is it and how do you know if your patient, your colleague or you may have it?
Neurology & ENT	Assessment of suspected neurological conditions, based on NICE 2019 guidance
Acute vertigo assessment, how do we differentiate between a peripheral (benign) and central (serious) cause?
Vestibular migraine
Headaches update, based on new BASH guidance
Infections	Covid-19…the latest emerging evidence on the coronavirus outbreak (this presentation will change as the situation evolves)
Update on management of common infections, including new NICE guidance on cellulitis and sore throat
Gastro	Diverticulitis, new NICE guidance and research: how to diagnose, how to manage and when to refer
Chronic diarrhoea in primary care: likely IBS-D but could it be bile acid malabsorption or microscopic colitis?
Last 30 mins, miscellaneous Hot Topics cases
As ever, we like to keep it practical and pragmatic whilst also considering many of the broader issues and challenges we face. And we like to have a laugh too!
Best Wishes
Simon, Neal, Siobhan, Kate, Zoe, Ahmed, Rob, Stephanie, Sarah, Duncan, Mark and Will

Minor Surgery and Joint Injection
The Hot Topics team recommends this course for anyone who has an interest in developing their skills and confidence in performing minor surgery and joint injections
Amongst our growing portfolio of courses, we have often been asked to provide courses on minor surgery, skin cancer and joint injections. Many GPs do not feel confident in starting these procedures themselves, or they may require an update mandated by NHS England or their CCG.
To meet this need we have partnered with Medical Skills Courses, who have been delivering ‘The Minor Surgery Course ™’ and their Joint Injection Course for nearly a decade. They have taught and received positive feedback from thousands of GPs in this time. We completely share their passion for equipping primary care with the best skills, knowledge and techniques, and enabling practices to offer a gold standard surgical service to their patients.
The focus is not around sit down lectures, but more styled on smaller groups of delegates having interactive discussions with the team, with the time to cover the full range of procedures within the core GP contract, and the Minor Surgery DES.
The Minor Surgery Course syllabus includes:
Pre-operative requirements – premises, equipment, contract, consent, CQC etc
Assessment – making a correct diagnosis and tools to help this
Preparation – several techniques to lower the chance of complications
Surgical Techniques – Naevi, Cysts, Abscesses, Lipoma, LA, Joint and Soft Tissue Injections
Wound Closure Techniques – 6+ closure techniques
Post-operative – Tips to reduce your workload, reduce problems and have happy patients
This highly popular Minor Surgery Course has nationally recognised course content, and is fully accredited by NHS England to cover Levels 1, 2 & 3 of the Minor Surgery Directly Enhanced Service, including DOPS assessment for GPs requiring re-accreditation.
Joint Injection Course syllabus includes:
The diagnosis of a range of soft tissue Injuries
The Treatment of Soft Tissue Injuries and the principles of corticosteroid injection therapy
Corticosteroid injection practice: Knee, Shoulder, Elbow, Hand, Wrist
With all courses you will receive a fully referenced handbook with diagrams, photographs and assessment techniques, that you can re-download with each update. You will have access to a range of high quality videos, consent forms and any other relevant national guidelines via a web link.
‘The pitch level of the educational content was perfect…. I would suggest that this should be required for any GP planning to offer this service. The course handbook is exceptional.’

Hot Topics Urgent Care Courses
Independent, unbiased, relevant
Acute clinical practice for both in and out of hours care
The NB Medical Urgent Care Course is designed for all health care professionals who see patients acutely, in or out of hours. This includes GPs, ECPs, ANPs, paramedics, nurses and pharmacists in primary care, but also secondary care health professionals seeing ambulatory patients in A&E / ACC environments whose final destination is back in the community.
Read More
The course is a truly multidisciplinary, evidence based update in acute patient management, covering national and international literature/ guidelines to ensure you are providing the most up to date evidence informed patient care.
The course revolves around short, engaging presentations using clinical cases and problems to illustrate recent learning points from the literature, followed by Q&A sessions.
It is fully supported by its own dedicated course book (in both paper and electronic formats), with an interactive app, that is designed to be easy to refer to when seeing patients in the acute setting.
Attracting 6 hours of CPD, it is fully accredited by the RCGP and ICGP and receives consistently outstanding feedback from its participants.
Most thorough and motivating course I’ve been on.
Brilliant course – completely relevant and to the point
